A common definition could support the preparation of the BA and the overall transparency and effectiveness of the UNFCCC process by highlighting the link between the level of action of developing countries and the level of support provided and, ultimately, the achievement of the objectives of the Convention and the Paris Agreement. In this context, two submissions included a proposal for an operational definition of climate finance, while other submissions included a proposal for an operational approach to achieving greater convergence among definitions over time, based either on common principles or responses to a common set of questions to provide granular information. </span></div><div left="113.41" right="125.98" top="536.08"><span x0="113.41" y0="536.08" x1="125.98" style="x0: 113.41; x1: 118.39; y0: 536.08; y1: 546.04; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">19.</span><span x0="141.73" y0="535.87" x1="484.31" style="x0: 141.73; x1: 151.13; y0: 535.87; y1: 545.83; width: 9.4; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">More methodologies on measuring outcomes of financing for climate resilience have emerged in recent years</span><span x0="250.21" y0="524.08" x1="484.25" style="x0: 250.21; x1: 252.7; y0: 524.08; y1: 534.04; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. Many multilateral institutions are in the process of developing or have already developed frameworks for measuring impacts, with an increasing focus on adaptation and resilience, such as the Resilience Rating System by the World Bank Group and the Climate Resilience Metrics Framework by MDBs and IDFC. Although approaches to measuring impacts of climate finance vary, most multilateral institutions, as well as bilateral contributors, use a similar set of mitigation and adaptation indicators. </span></div><div left="113.41" right="125.98" top="446.08"><span x0="113.41" y0="446.08" x1="125.98" style="x0: 113.41; x1: 118.39; y0: 446.08; y1: 456.04; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">20.</span><span x0="141.73" y0="445.87" x1="484.28" style="x0: 141.73; x1: 148.37; y0: 445.87; y1: 455.83; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">There are four common decision points identified in emerging methodologies and metrics in use for tracking consistency with low GHG emission and climate-resilient development pathways</span><span x0="210.61" y0="422.07" x1="484.3" style="x0: 210.61; x1: 213.1; y0: 422.07; y1: 432.03; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">.As with tracking climate finance, emerging methodologies relevant to tracking consistency with the long-term goal under Article 2, paragraph 1(c), of the Paris Agreement also need to overcome issues related to definitions, the scope or boundary of tracking, data availability and comparability.  </span></div><div left="113.41" right="484.31" top="368.07"><span x0="113.41" y0="368.07" x1="484.31" style="x0: 113.41; x1: 118.39; y0: 368.07; y1: 378.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">21.Methods differ as to the type of finance flows, stocks and services tracked (primary or secondary markets) and the ways of measuring consistency (e.g. on the basis of GHG emissions, emissions intensity metrics or technology choices).

Different pathways may be chosen relative to their consistency with low GHG emission development and mitigation goals, and to their consistency with climate-resilient development and adaptation or resilience goals. Pathways may result in compatible activity lists or performance metrics against which to measure action. In addition, the timescale used to measure consistency is important. This could be, for example, within 5 or 10 years, or by a given year, such as 2050; </span></div><div left="141.71" right="484.28" top="224.06"><span x0="141.71" y0="224.06" x1="484.28" style="x0: 141.71; x1: 145.02; y0: 224.06; y1: 234.02; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(b)Reviewing the activities and actions to be tracked (e.g. investments, economic activities such as production and sales or purchasing of goods and services, policymaking, legislation and voluntary standards) that the stakeholder undertakes, which is relevant to whether the pathway will be achieved; </span></div><div left="141.72" right="484.29" top="170.05"><span x0="141.72" y0="170.05" x1="484.29" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 145.03; y0: 170.05; y1: 180.01; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(c)Understanding which finance flows that go towards realizing the activities and actions should be tracked by the stakeholder; </span></div><div left="141.71" right="484.31" top="140.05"><span x0="141.71" y0="140.05" x1="484.31" style="x0: 141.71; x1: 145.02; y0: 140.05; y1: 150.01; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(d)Identifying which key metrics to use to assess whether finance flows and related processes result in activities and actions that are consistent with the given pathway identified during the review. </span></div></body></html>
