The types of methodology applied vary. Most methodologies used to identify mitigation needs are quantitative, while a lower number of qualitative methodologies are used to identify adaptation needs. However, in recent reports, some countries have used methodologies to identify both mitigation and adaptation needs. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.32" top="672.16"><span x0="113.4" y0="672.16" x1="484.32" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 672.16; y1: 682.12; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">50.Countries in the Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America and Caribbean regions present region-level information about methodologies applied to determine mitigation needs. Countries in the Africa and Asia-Pacific regions also present information about methodologies used to determine adaptation needs. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.25" top="620.19"><span x0="113.39" y0="620.19" x1="484.25" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 620.19; y1: 630.15; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">51.UNFCCC reporting guidelines and guidance, such as those provided for TNA preparation, have facilitated identification of needs for technology transfer and capacity-building related to mitigation and adaptation actions through methodologies such as the TNA methodology and the guidance for preparing a TAP.</span><span x0="337.68" y0="589.88" x1="343.68" style="x0: 337.68; x1: 340.68; y0: 589.88; y1: 595.88; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">13</span><span x0="348.36" y0="585.66" x1="484.29" style="x0: 348.36; x1: 355.55; y0: 585.66; y1: 595.62; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">However, the existing reporting guidelines and guidance do not include specific provisions on how to assess these needs at the local level. As such, countries assess their needs on the basis of methodologies developed for application at the national or international level. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.27" top="533.69"><span x0="113.4" y0="533.69" x1="484.27" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 533.69; y1: 543.65; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">52.Methodologies used by developing countries to determine mitigation needs include both top-down and bottom-up models for the energy and non-energy sectors. Bottom-up models are suited for studying options that have specific sectoral and technological implications. Top-down models are useful for studying broad macroeconomic and fiscal policies for mitigation, such as carbon or other environmental taxes. Methodologies applied to identify mitigation needs mainly focus on the cross-cutting, energy, greenhouse gas inventory preparation, waste, transport, agriculture, forestry, building and industry sectors. </span></div><div left="113.37" right="484.22" top="447.15"><span x0="113.37" y0="447.15" x1="484.22" style="x0: 113.37; x1: 118.35; y0: 447.15; y1: 457.11; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">53.Methodologies used by developing countries to determine adaptation needs mostly include vulnerability assessments that determine the levels of risk and vulnerability for each sector. These methodologies mainly focus on the agriculture, ecosystem and biodiversity, water and cross-cutting sectors. </span></div><div left="91.65" right="333.3" top="390.76"><span x0="91.65" y0="390.76" x1="333.3" style="x0: 91.65; x1: 96.63; y0: 390.76; y1: 400.72; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">2.Methodologies used at the regional and global level </span></div><div left="113.37" right="484.26" top="373.1"><span x0="113.37" y0="373.1" x1="484.26" style="x0: 113.37; x1: 118.35; y0: 373.1; y1: 383.06; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">54.For international and regional reports, top-down methodologies have been developed and applied to identify finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building needs. Such reports have provided alternative methodologies to developing countries that have been adapted to national circumstances and contexts and used to determine national needs. </span></div><div left="87.48" right="438.07" top="301.34"><span x0="87.48" y0="301.34" x1="438.07" style="x0: 87.48; x1: 96.14; y0: 301.34; y1: 313.34; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">D.Challenges, opportunities and gaps in determining the needs of developing country Parties </span></div><div left="91.68" right="175.89" top="264.21"><span x0="91.68" y0="264.21" x1="175.89" style="x0: 91.68; x1: 96.66; y0: 264.21; y1: 274.17; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">1.Opportunities </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.26" top="246.66"><span x0="113.4" y0="246.66" x1="484.26" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 246.66; y1: 256.62; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">55.There are several regional and global specialized institutions that can support countries in their needs identification process by providing expertise and data. Some of these institutions are United Nations agencies, to which countries have quick and easy access and which can be engaged with during the needs identification process to provide the required support. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.3" top="183.17"><span x0="113.4" y0="183.17" x1="484.3" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 183.17; y1: 193.13; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">56.A number of platforms have been established by various institutions, including United Nations agencies and MDBs. These platforms offer a good opportunity for developing countries to share their experience and good practices in the needs identification process. Most developing countries are already using these platforms to share their experience. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.37" top="131.2"><span x0="113.4" y0="131.2" x1="484.37" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 131.2; y1: 141.16; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">57.Several initiatives have been established that can help in the needs identification process. These initiatives include the establishment of emissions inventories, which provide some of the data and information that can facilitate the prioritization of sectors and activities as part of the countryâ€™s climate change needs identification process. </span></div><div left="101.64" right="107.64" top="71.0"><span x0="101.64" y0="71.0" x1="107.64" style="x0: 101.64; x1: 104.64; y0: 71.0; y1: 77.0; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">13</span><span x0="113.28" y0="67.08" x1="263.88" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 118.78; y0: 67.08; y1: 76.08; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Technology Executive Committee. 2020. </span><span x0="263.84" y0="67.08" x1="463.16" style="x0: 263.84; x1: 269.34; y0: 67.08; y1: 76.08; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: JOHQZF+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;">Enhancing implementation of the results of technology needs assessments</span><span x0="179.56" y0="56.16" x1="294.96" style="x0: 179.56; x1: 181.81; y0: 56.16; y1: 65.16; width: 2.25; font-size: 9.0; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">.
