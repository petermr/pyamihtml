Often recovered through mechanisms such as administrative budgets and implementing agency fees, the degree of such costs varies across institutions by nature of their different approaches and delivery models. In 2017–2018, major multilateral climate funds spent USD 217 million on administration costs, while implementing entity fees amounted to USD 231 million. In general, the administration costs of climate finance management have tended to decrease over time. The alignment of administrative functions between funds (e.g. the GEF administration of the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund) can streamline management and disbursement mechanisms. This is essential in order to retain the trust that contributors and beneficiaries place in the funds. However, it must be balanced by the above-mentioned rise in implementing entities and associated costs.  </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.31" top="608.08"><span x0="113.39" y0="608.08" x1="484.31" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 608.08; y1: 618.04; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">39.The capacity of institutions to make strategic choices to use climate finance has long been recognized as important. Both the Adaptation Fund and the GCF have developed readiness programmes, supporting countries to plan for, access and deliver climate finance. Together these funds have approved over USD 285 million in readiness support. The GEF has instead incorporated capacity-building objectives into existing project funding through “enabling activities”. Reviews of these programmes have endorsed the use of readiness support to build all aspects of the capacity required to mobilize finance for climate action, rather than a focus on supporting access to multilateral climate funds.  </span></div><div left="113.38" right="125.95" top="506.07"><span x0="113.38" y0="506.07" x1="125.95" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 506.07; y1: 516.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">40.</span><span x0="141.7" y0="505.87" x1="484.29" style="x0: 141.7; x1: 149.45; y0: 505.87; y1: 515.83; width: 7.75; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Ownership over the end use of climate finance flows remains a critical factor in its effectiveness</span><span x0="179.74" y0="494.07" x1="484.25" style="x0: 179.74; x1: 182.23; y0: 494.07; y1: 504.03; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">.The broad concept of ownership encompasses the consistency of climate finance with national priorities, the degree to which national systems are used for both spending and tracking, and the engagement of a wide range of stakeholders. Financial needs are being increasingly articulated, but to date lack sufficient comparability of methods, including for costs, time frames and assumptions, in order to make an accurate assessment of the alignment of climate finance provision with such needs. Ministries of finance and planning are strengthening their commitments to engage in climate change planning, with national-level institutions playing a greater role through domestic tracking, monitoring and verification of climate finance. </span></div><div left="113.38" right="125.95" top="380.06"><span x0="113.38" y0="380.06" x1="125.95" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 380.06; y1: 390.02; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">41.</span><span x0="141.7" y0="379.85" x1="479.33" style="x0: 141.7; x1: 145.57; y0: 379.85; y1: 389.81; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Impact reporting systems and practices for climate finance are maturing</span><span x0="479.38" y0="380.06" x1="484.27" style="x0: 479.38; x1: 481.87; y0: 380.06; y1: 390.02; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. Mechanisms for monitoring the impact of climate finance may be relevant for the implementation of the enhanced transparency framework. While the reporting of results is slowly improving under multilateral climate funds, MDBs do not include information on mitigation and adaptation outcomes in their joint reports and bilateral contributors have varied approaches to reporting on impacts. Emission reduction remains the primary impact metric for climate change mitigation, while adaptation impact continues to be measured primarily in terms of the number and type of people that benefit from projects. It remains difficult to accurately assess the quality of the impacts (i.e. outcomes) achieved, given that they are being presented in a multitude of formats and over varying timescales and are hard to verify. </span></div><div left="113.38" right="125.95" top="242.04"><span x0="113.38" y0="242.04" x1="125.95" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 242.04; y1: 252.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">42.</span><span x0="141.7" y0="241.84" x1="484.23" style="x0: 141.7; x1: 148.89; y0: 241.84; y1: 251.8; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">A number of decisions have strengthened the way in which gender issues are addressed in the UNFCCC process</span><span x0="261.81" y0="230.04" x1="484.26" style="x0: 261.81; x1: 264.3; y0: 230.04; y1: 240.0; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. Gender-responsive public finance is likely to be more effective and efficient. Multilateral climate funds have been front runners in mainstreaming gender considerations in governance and operations. Those under the Financial Mechanism now have a mandate to include information on gender considerations in their annual reports to the COP. While advances are being made, there is scarce information on gender-responsive budgeting, suggesting that work remains to be done in integrating gender considerations on the ground.  </span></div><div left="113.37" right="125.94" top="140.03"><span x0="113.37" y0="140.03" x1="125.94" style="x0: 113.37; x1: 118.35; y0: 140.03; y1: 149.99; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">43.</span><span x0="141.69" y0="139.83" x1="484.25" style="x0: 141.69; x1: 148.33; y0: 139.83; y1: 149.79; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">The drivers of climate finance flows can consist of both demand- and supply-side actions but may differ in terms of mitigation or adaptation objectives</span><span x0="417.57" y0="128.03" x1="484.25" style="x0: 417.57; x1: 420.06; y0: 128.03; y1: 137.99; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. For mitigation finance, policy targets and support mechanisms have played a major role in driving climate finance flows, such as in the role of long-term fixed prices in supporting renewable energy deployment and more recently purchasing incentives for electric vehicles and bans on the sale of new combustion engine vehicles in the long term.
