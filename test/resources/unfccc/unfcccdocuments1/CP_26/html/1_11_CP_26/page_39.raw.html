For example, as shown in figure 2, NDCs included 1,991 needs for adaptation and 1,956 for mitigation.</span></div><div left="87.0" right="201.03" top="682.37"><span x0="87.0" y0="682.37" x1="201.03" style="x0: 87.0; x1: 90.32; y0: 682.37; y1: 692.33; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: JOHQZF+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;">(ii)Regional distribution </span></div><div left="113.41" right="484.27" top="664.61"><span x0="113.41" y0="664.61" x1="484.27" style="x0: 113.41; x1: 118.39; y0: 664.61; y1: 674.57; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">23.When the number of expressed needs across the nine national report types is considered, developing country Parties in the Africa and Asia-Pacific regions identified comparable numbers of needs across the national reports with broad thematic and sectoral coverage such as BURs, NCs and NDCs, comparable with the Latin America and Caribbean region only in the case of BURs (see figure 2, section 2.2). Developing country Parties in the Asia-Pacific region used NAPs and TAPs to further specify adaptation needs, as more than half of the needs identified in NAPs and TAPs were from this region. Developing country Parties in the Latin America and Caribbean, and Eastern European regions expressed more needs in their NCs than in other national reports. Latin American and Caribbean Parties expressed a considerable number of adaptation needs in adaptation-specific national reports (e.g. ACs and NAPs) when compared with the overall number of needs expressed in their BURs and NDCs. Developing country Parties in the African region expressed more needs through TNAs compared with other regions, reporting 993 needs compared with the 642 needs identified by Parties in the Asia-Pacific region. </span></div><div left="84.24" right="279.57" top="491.39"><span x0="84.24" y0="491.39" x1="279.57" style="x0: 84.24; x1: 87.56; y0: 491.39; y1: 501.35; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: JOHQZF+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;">(iii)Distribution by means of implementation </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.27" top="473.64"><span x0="113.4" y0="473.64" x1="484.27" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 473.64; y1: 483.6; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">24.Qualitative data show a significant prevalence of capacity-building and technology development and transfer needs, which may in part be due to the resources developing countries can access to support the identification of these needs. The number of capacity-building needs is higher than finance needs and technology development and transfer needs identified in the nine national report types except for TNAs (see figure 2, section 2.3). Capacity-building needs expressed across the national reports typically cover areas such as research, training and education, awareness-raising, institutional strengthening and coordination, and policy development.</span></div><div left="85.29" right="264.31" top="369.33"><span x0="85.29" y0="369.33" x1="264.31" style="x0: 85.29; x1: 88.6; y0: 369.33; y1: 379.29; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: JOHQZF+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;">(iv)Sectoral and subsectoral distribution </span></div><div left="113.38" right="484.24" top="351.57"><span x0="113.38" y0="351.57" x1="484.24" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 351.57; y1: 361.53; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">25.On the basis of the number of mitigation needs expressed across the nine national report types, energy is the lead sector for climate change mitigation actions, followed by land use and forestry, transport, agriculture, and waste and sanitation (see figure 3, section 3.1).</span></div><div left="113.38" right="484.27" top="311.12"><span x0="113.38" y0="311.12" x1="484.27" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 311.12; y1: 321.08; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">26.When considering mitigation needs by sector and subsector, the nine types of national report show that most needs in the </span><span x0="251.44" y0="299.39" x1="308.19" style="x0: 251.44; x1: 255.86; y0: 299.39; y1: 309.35; width: 4.42; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">energy sector</span><span x0="310.53" y0="299.6" x1="484.27" style="x0: 310.53; x1: 313.85; y0: 299.6; y1: 309.56; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">relate to requests for support for the energy efficiency and renewable energy subsectors, albeit with some variation between them. In NDCs, needs for renewable energy development were identified almost twice as frequently as those for energy efficiency (399 and 261, respectively) but the total nominal value of energy efficiency projects was 1.5 times larger than that of renewable energy projects (USD 377.22 billion and USD 198.08 billion, respectively). In BURs and NCs, more needs related to renewable energy than to energy efficiency were identified. TNAs included a larger variation among energy subsectors, including the development of natural gas, the phasing-out of inefficient subsidies, the exploration of carbon capture and storage, and the development of the efficient use of coal. </span></div><div left="113.38" right="355.64" top="178.6"><span x0="113.38" y0="178.6" x1="355.64" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 178.6; y1: 188.56; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">27.The majority of expressed mitigation needs in the </span><span x0="357.41" y0="178.39" x1="481.9" style="x0: 357.41; x1: 360.18; y0: 178.39; y1: 188.35; width: 2.77; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">land-use and forestry sector</span><span x0="113.38" y0="167.08" x1="484.26" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 116.69; y0: 167.08; y1: 177.04; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">represented a few densely forested countries, such as Bhutan, Brazil, the Congo, Costa Rica, Ghana, Guyana, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Suriname, the United Republic of Tanzania and Viet Nam. This sector covers key activities such as reforestation, forest fire prevention, social forestry development, sustainable forest management, development of sustainable supply chains for forest commodities, spatial planning forestry research and some land-use activities, such as management of livestock. Data in NCs and NDCs showed that, within this sector, needs related to reforestation are the largest needs expressed in financial terms. </span></div><div left="113.38" right="484.3" top="69.01"><span x0="113.38" y0="69.01" x1="484.3" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 69.01; y1: 78.97; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">28.On the basis of the number of adaptation-related needs expressed across the nine national report types, agriculture and water are the two lead sectors for climate change </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="783.0" width="484.8" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
