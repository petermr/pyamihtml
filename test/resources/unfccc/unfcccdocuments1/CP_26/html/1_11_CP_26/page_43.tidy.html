During the initial phase, background information is collected and assessments are carried out to help scope the needs. The stakeholders consulted are mainly from government line ministries, though in some instances they include non-governmental organizations and the private sector. Local communities are the least consulted stakeholders during the process. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.3" top="515.93"><span x0="113.4" y0="515.93" x1="484.3" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 515.93; y1: 525.89; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">44.In most of the national reports, the description of the needs identification process does not explicitly mention inclusivity aspects. Needs related to gender and local communities are captured in some reports emanating from those processes. However, where the needs identification process has projects and programmes as part of its output, gender and other inclusivity aspects of various stakeholders were mostly elaborated in the project or programme documents. </span></div><div left="91.68" right="467.05" top="436.49"><span x0="91.68" y0="436.49" x1="467.05" style="x0: 91.68; x1: 96.66; y0: 436.49; y1: 446.45; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">3.Processes and approaches used by other actors, namely multilateral climate funds, multilateral development banks and United Nations agencies </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.31" top="406.94"><span x0="113.4" y0="406.94" x1="484.31" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 406.94; y1: 416.9; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">45.MDBs and United Nations agencies play a critical role in supporting developing countries in their needs identification process. In most cases, these agencies use experts during country-driven needs identification consultation forums to provide insights and share data that may help developing countries better identify and report their needs. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.29" top="354.85"><span x0="113.39" y0="354.85" x1="484.29" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 354.85; y1: 364.81; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">46.In other instances, MDBs and United Nations agencies provide financial and technical support for developing countries in the needs identification process. This support is used to carry out in-depth sectoral analysis to identify pathways within these sectors where considerable effort is needed and where greater impacts can be achieved. For countries that have benefited from this support for their second NDCs, their reports provide more granular information on needs, including by sector, compared with their first NDCs. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.22" top="279.83"><span x0="113.39" y0="279.83" x1="484.22" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 279.83; y1: 289.79; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">47.The multilateral climate funds established under the Convention, namely the GEF, including the special climate funds managed by the GEF (the Special Climate Change Fund and the Least Developed Countries Fund), the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund, also play a critical role in providing financial support for countries in facilitating their climate change needs identification process. This is particularly evident in the case of the Green Climate Fund and Adaptation Fund readiness support and the GEF Capacity-building Initiative for Transparency Trust Fund, which enable countries to identify and prioritize their climate change needs. </span></div><div left="87.48" right="462.84" top="173.54"><span x0="87.48" y0="173.54" x1="462.84" style="x0: 87.48; x1: 96.14; y0: 173.54; y1: 185.54; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">C.Methodologies and underlying assumptions used in determining the needs of developing country Parties </span></div><div left="91.68" right="474.15" top="136.53"><span x0="91.68" y0="136.53" x1="474.15" style="x0: 91.68; x1: 96.66; y0: 136.53; y1: 146.49; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">1.Methodologies used at the national level by developing countries in national reports  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.3" top="118.98"><span x0="113.4" y0="118.98" x1="484.3" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 118.98; y1: 128.94; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">48.Developing country Parties identify adaptation and mitigation needs in preparing their national reports, following UNFCCC reporting guidelines and guidance and, in some cases, other methodologies adapted to their national context. The approaches taken vary depending on institutional and human capacities, cost, geography, time frame and data availability. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.0" y1="783.0" y2="783.0"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
