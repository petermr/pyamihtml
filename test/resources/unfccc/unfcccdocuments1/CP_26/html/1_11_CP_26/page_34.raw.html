The needs included in national reports are identified using a top-down approach (i.e. needs that are typically estimated using economy-wide or sectoral modelling techniques) or a bottom-up approach (i.e. needs that are typically identified from a project pipeline). Developing country Parties periodically update their national reports submitted to the UNFCCC, reflecting changing circumstances and improvements in their data-collection processes and analysis. Therefore, data and information on needs may not be exhaustive as the needs are dynamically changing. </span></div><div left="120.48" right="137.56" top="249.84"><span x0="120.48" y0="249.84" x1="137.56" style="x0: 120.48; x1: 126.48; y0: 249.84; y1: 258.84; width: 6.0; font-size: 9.0; font-family: JOHQZF+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;">Note</span><span x0="137.52" y0="249.84" x1="295.4" style="x0: 137.52; x1: 140.02; y0: 249.84; y1: 258.84; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">: Ranges of costs included where available. </span></div><div left="87.48" right="288.35" top="225.69"><span x0="87.48" y0="225.69" x1="288.35" style="x0: 87.48; x1: 90.8; y0: 225.69; y1: 235.65; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">(a)Insights from quantitative data on needs </span></div><div left="113.41" right="484.29" top="208.14"><span x0="113.41" y0="208.14" x1="484.29" style="x0: 113.41; x1: 118.39; y0: 208.14; y1: 218.1; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">15.The needs identified and articulated by developing country Parties across the nine types of national report encompass a wide range of financial, technology development and </span></div><div left="104.64" right="107.64" top="170.0"><span x0="104.64" y0="170.0" x1="107.64" style="x0: 104.64; x1: 107.64; y0: 170.0; y1: 176.0; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">6</span><span x0="113.28" y0="166.08" x1="461.48" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 119.78; y0: 166.08; y1: 175.08; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Only the most recent submissions to the UNFCCC were used in the analysis as Parties regularly update information on their needs to reflect changing circumstances. To avoid double counting where Parties may have provided the same information in different reports (e.g. BURs and NDCs), each type of report is treated separately, without aggregation across them. </span><span x0="104.64" y0="126.08" x1="107.64" style="x0: 104.64; x1: 107.64; y0: 126.08; y1: 132.08; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">7</span><span x0="113.28" y0="122.16" x1="468.29" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 119.78; y0: 122.16; y1: 131.16; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Needs are catalogued in the analysis at the most granular level at which information was provided (i.e. a project or activity expressed as a need by a developing country is counted as a single activity; if activity-level information was not provided, needs are counted at the sector level; if sector-level information was not provided, needs are counted at the thematic level, etc.). Depending on the nature of the report, it is possible that the priorities and programmes consist of multiple projects and action items. See chap. 1 of the first NDR for details on the scope of the quantitative and qualitative information collected from national reports. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="783.0" width="484.8" height="0.4800000000000182"/><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="56.64" y="181.92" width="144.0" height="0.48099999999999454"/></ns0:g></body></html>
