These capacity gaps vary widely across countries and include the lack of qualified personnel to spearhead the needs identification process and the lack of institutional-level capacity. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.27" top="621.15"><span x0="113.39" y0="621.15" x1="484.27" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 621.15; y1: 631.11; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">64.Limited availability of granular data at the sector and subsector level constitutes one of the major gaps identified by developing countries. As a result, many developing countries provide cost estimates for overall needs rather than disaggregated by theme or sector. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.29" top="580.71"><span x0="113.39" y0="580.71" x1="484.29" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 580.71; y1: 590.67; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">65.The lack of specialized national institutions to spearhead the means of implementation under the Convention, such as technology development and transfer, and capacity-building, limits the ability of some developing countries to track needs continuously and identify additional and emerging needs. </span></div><div left="113.38" right="484.26" top="528.62"><span x0="113.38" y0="528.62" x1="484.26" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 528.62; y1: 538.58; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">66.Limited detailed guidance on the structure and content of reports submitted to the UNFCCC resulted in needs with varying levels of detail across countries. Where such guidance was available, for instance for TNAs, the needs were identified at a higher level of detail compared with needs communicated in other national reports. </span></div><div left="91.66" right="469.11" top="472.23"><span x0="91.66" y0="472.23" x1="469.11" style="x0: 91.66; x1: 96.64; y0: 472.23; y1: 482.19; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">4.Insights into determining needs using available resources: country case studies and experience </span></div><div left="113.38" right="484.26" top="442.68"><span x0="113.38" y0="442.68" x1="484.26" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 442.68; y1: 452.64; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">67.Country case studies have shown that the needs identification process provides an opportunity for countries to translate their needs into investment opportunities and climate actions, including by using existing support mechanisms to prioritize and cost identified needs and turn needs into project ideas for support. For example, through the TNA process, some countries identified technology support needs and submitted a request for technology assistance to formulate project ideas related to technology development and transfer. </span></div><div left="113.37" right="484.23" top="367.66"><span x0="113.37" y0="367.66" x1="484.23" style="x0: 113.37; x1: 118.35; y0: 367.66; y1: 377.62; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">68.Costing adaptation and mitigation needs for action is becoming a crucial area of work at the national level in order to better identify gaps where financial support is needed and ways to leverage public and private resources. </span></div><div left="91.65" right="473.33" top="322.68"><span x0="91.65" y0="322.68" x1="473.33" style="x0: 91.65; x1: 96.63; y0: 322.68; y1: 332.64; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">5.Co-benefits related to addressing the needs of developing country Parties, such as in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals, disaster risk reduction and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda </span></div><div left="113.37" right="484.22" top="281.13"><span x0="113.37" y0="281.13" x1="484.22" style="x0: 113.37; x1: 118.35; y0: 281.13; y1: 291.09; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">69.For most countries, climate change needs are aligned with the targets set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As the SDGs are ideally indivisible, all developing country Parties covered in this report are taking action to address SDG 13 that relates to taking action to address climate change, and SDG 13 affects all the other SDGs. Overall, the needs identified by developing countries touch on all SDGs, with 75 per cent of NDCs having linkages to SDGs 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 17. </span></div><div left="113.36" right="484.21" top="206.11"><span x0="113.36" y0="206.11" x1="484.21" style="x0: 113.36; x1: 118.34; y0: 206.11; y1: 216.07; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">70.In their national reports, some developing country Parties refer to the Addis Ababa Action Agenda provision for mobilizing and aligning local resources for climate action. This is particularly evident in countries that capture their climate action budgets under the national budgeting process.  </span></div><div left="85.56" right="227.31" top="143.95"><span x0="85.56" y0="143.95" x1="227.31" style="x0: 85.56; x1: 95.7; y0: 143.95; y1: 157.99; width: 10.14; font-size: 14.04; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">V.Recommendations </span></div><div left="113.4" right="481.89" top="121.14"><span x0="113.4" y0="121.14" x1="481.89" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 121.14; y1: 131.1; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">71.The SCF invites the COP and the CMA to consider the following recommendations: </span></div><div left="141.72" right="152.83" top="103.74"><span x0="141.72" y0="103.74" x1="152.83" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 145.03; y0: 103.74; y1: 113.7; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(a)</span><span x0="170.03" y0="103.74" x1="216.45" style="x0: 170.03; x1: 176.12; y0: 103.74; y1: 113.7; width: 6.09; font-size: 9.96; font-family: JOHQZF+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;">Encourage </span><span x0="216.95" y0="103.74" x1="484.27" style="x0: 216.95; x1: 221.93; y0: 103.74; y1: 113.7; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">developing country Parties and climate finance providers, as well as multilateral and financial institutions, private finance data providers and other relevant institutions, to enhance the availability of granular, country-level data on needs related to the implementation of the Convention and the Paris Agreement with a view to addressing </span></div></body></html>
