Due diligence has been undertaken to use the best information available from the most credible sources. In compiling estimates, efforts have been made to ensure that they are based on activities in line with the convergence of operational definitions of climate finance identified in the first BA and to avoid double counting by focusing on primary finance, which is finance for a new physical item or activity. Challenges were nevertheless encountered in collecting, aggregating and analysing information from diverse sources.  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="120.93" top="587.09"><span x0="113.4" y0="587.09" x1="120.93" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 587.09; y1: 597.05; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">7.</span><span x0="141.72" y0="586.88" x1="216.05" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 148.91; y0: 586.88; y1: 596.84; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Data uncertainty</span><span x0="216.12" y0="587.09" x1="484.29" style="x0: 216.12; x1: 218.89; y0: 587.09; y1: 597.05; width: 2.77; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">: Most of the uncertainties associated with each source of data which have different underlying causes identified in the previous BAs persist, although there have been some improvements. Uncertainties relating to the data on domestic public investments result from the lack of geographical coverage and differences in the way tracking methods are applied, as well as significant changes in the methods used for estimating investment in energy efficiency and sustainable transport over time. Uncertainties also arise from the lack of transparency of data for determining private climate finance; the methods used for estimating adaptation finance; differences in the assumptions used in underlying formulas for attributing finance from MDBs to developed countries; the classification of sustainable or green finance; and the incomplete data on non-concessional finance flows. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="120.93" top="461.08"><span x0="113.4" y0="461.08" x1="120.93" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 461.08; y1: 471.04; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">8.</span><span x0="141.72" y0="460.87" x1="184.23" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 148.91; y0: 460.87; y1: 470.83; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Data gaps</span><span x0="184.2" y0="461.08" x1="484.33" style="x0: 184.2; x1: 186.96; y0: 461.08; y1: 471.04; width: 2.77; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">: Significant gaps in the coverage of sectors and sources of climate finance remain, particularly with regard to private investment, and adaptation and resilience. While estimates of incremental investment in energy efficiency have improved, understanding of the public and private sources of finance and the financial instruments used remains inadequate. For data on sustainable transport, efforts have been made to improve coverage of public and private investment in electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. However, high-quality data on private investments in sustainable agriculture, forestry and land use, water, waste, and adaptation and resilience are particularly lacking. Specifically, adaptation finance estimates, which are context-specific and incremental, are difficult to compare with mitigation finance estimates, and more work is needed on estimating climate-resilient investments.  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.29" top="323.06"><span x0="113.4" y0="323.06" x1="484.29" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 323.06; y1: 333.02; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">9.In relation to mapping information relevant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), of the Paris Agreement, the lack of a common interpretation of or guidelines on what information qualifies as relevant presents a challenge in adequately capturing the scope and depth of related action. For the fourth BA an actor-specific mapping approach was adopted, as opposed to focusing on particular financial instruments, asset classes, or categories of action, in order to capture what financial sector actors consider to be relevant information on activities to be consistent with or align with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Such mapping may be non-exhaustive and limited in terms of representation across geographic areas and sectors. It may also obscure the role of actors that work across multiple categories. Given that a significant amount of information considered relevant is to be derived from multiple-member initiatives and coalitions, due to potential benefits of network effects, focusing on these groups may limit the mapping of information from individual cases that may be considered best practice or leading examples. Furthermore, there is a limited track record and limited in-depth information related to implementing activities consistent with or that align with the Paris Agreement that might enable a thorough assessment of their effectiveness, and therefore their relevance, in achieving the goal outlined in Article 2, paragraph 1(c). </span></div><div left="113.38" right="484.3" top="125.04"><span x0="113.38" y0="125.04" x1="484.3" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 125.04; y1: 135.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">10.The limitations outlined above need to be taken into consideration when deriving conclusions and policy implications from the fourth BA. The SCF will continue to contribute, through its activities, to the progressive improvement of the measurement, reporting and verification of climate finance in future BAs, to help address these challenges. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.0" y1="783.0" y2="783.0"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
