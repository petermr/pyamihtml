The attribution of these flows to developed countries is calculated at between USD 23.3 billion to USD 24.1 billion in 2017 and USD 25.8 billion to 28.0 billion in 2018.  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.32" top="716.1"><span x0="113.4" y0="716.1" x1="484.32" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 716.1; y1: 726.06; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">29.The uncertainty of the data on the geographic sources and destinations of private finance flows to developing countries remains significant. OECD estimates that private climate finance mobilized by developed countries through bilateral and multilateral channels amounted to USD 14.5 billion in 2017 and USD 14.6 billion in 2018.  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.25" top="662.1"><span x0="113.4" y0="662.1" x1="484.25" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 662.1; y1: 672.06; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">30.Information on the recipients of climate finance remains limited. The increase in BUR submissions from non-Annex I Parties has resulted in a greater amount of information on finance received than for previous BAs. However, time lags in data availability for reporting make it difficult to provide updated or complete information on finance received in 2017&#8211;2018. Of the 63 Parties that had submitted BURs as at December 2020, 28 included some information on climate finance received in 2017 or 2018. In total, USD 7.8 billion was reported as received for projects starting in 2017 and USD 2 billion for projects starting in 2018. A total of 23 Annex II Parties included information on recipients of finance at either the country or project level in their BR4s. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="125.97" top="548.09"><span x0="113.4" y0="548.09" x1="125.97" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 548.09; y1: 558.05; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">31.</span><span x0="141.72" y0="547.88" x1="484.3" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 147.25; y0: 547.88; y1: 557.84; width: 5.54; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">South&#8211;South climate finance flows have increased, but data availability and coverage remain limited</span><span x0="219.36" y0="536.08" x1="484.35" style="x0: 219.36; x1: 221.85; y0: 536.08; y1: 546.04; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">.While data availability and coverage of climate finance flows between developing countries remain limited, it is a growing area of global climate finance flows. Several countries voluntarily report to standardized reporting systems such as OECD DAC. Up to 20 development finance institutions that are IDFC members are based in non-OECD countries, and MDBs led by developing countries such as the Asian Infrastructure Development Bank and the New Development Bank continue to increase finance flows. Estimates of South&#8211;South climate finance flows amounted to USD 17.8 billion to USD 18.0 billion in 2017 and USD 18.0 billion to USD 18.2 billion in 2018.  </span></div><div left="87.48" right="298.32" top="420.14"><span x0="87.48" y0="420.14" x1="298.32" style="x0: 87.48; x1: 96.14; y0: 420.14; y1: 432.14; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">C.Assessment of climate finance flows </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.25" top="396.66"><span x0="113.4" y0="396.66" x1="484.25" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 396.66; y1: 406.62; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">32.Trends in public concessional climate finance, including bilateral flows, multilateral climate funds and funds from MDBs, point to increasing flows towards developing countries from multilateral sources, while bilateral climate finance flows have stagnated.  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="125.97" top="354.66"><span x0="113.4" y0="354.66" x1="125.97" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 354.66; y1: 364.62; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">33.</span><span x0="141.72" y0="354.45" x1="432.36" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 147.25; y0: 354.45; y1: 364.41; width: 5.54; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Support for mitigation remains greater than support for adaptation</span><span x0="432.36" y0="354.66" x1="484.29" style="x0: 432.36; x1: 434.85; y0: 354.66; y1: 364.62; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">.Adaptation finance has remained at between 20 and 25 per cent of committed concessional finance across all sources (noting measurement differences), showing little movement since the previous BA (see the table below). However, the continued rise in public climate finance flows contributing towards both adaptation and mitigation complicates this assessment. The rise is most obvious in flows from multilateral climate funds and through bilateral channels. While the GCF allocates climate finance for projects in this cross-cutting category to adaptation or mitigation, not all institutions do so in their programming or reporting. This makes it more difficult to track progress in scaling up adaptation finance and ultimately achieving balance between finance for adaptation and mitigation objectives.  </span></div><div left="113.39" right="125.96" top="228.65"><span x0="113.39" y0="228.65" x1="125.96" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 228.65; y1: 238.61; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">34.</span><span x0="141.71" y0="228.44" x1="418.4" style="x0: 141.71; x1: 149.46; y0: 228.44; y1: 238.4; width: 7.75; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Grants continue to be a key instrument for adaptation finance</span><span x0="418.42" y0="228.65" x1="484.27" style="x0: 418.42; x1: 420.91; y0: 228.65; y1: 238.61; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. In 2017&#8211;2018 grants accounted for 64 and 94 per cent of the face value of bilateral adaptation finance reported to OECD and of adaptation finance from multilateral climate funds, respectively (see the table below). During the same period, 9 per cent of adaptation finance flowing through MDBs was grant-based. These figures indicate no change since 2015&#8211;2016. Mitigation finance remains less concessional in nature, with 30 per cent of bilateral flows, 29 per cent of multilateral climate fund approvals and 3 per cent of MDB investments taking the form of grants. These figures, however, may not fully capture the added value brought by combining different types of financial instruments, or technical assistance with capital flows, which can often lead to greater innovation or more sustainable implementation.  </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="783.0" width="484.8" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
