Progress regarding the consistency of climate finance reporting was observed in the BR4 common tabular format submissions from Annex II Parties and the provision of qualitative information in the documentation boxes of those tables or in the BRs. One improvement relates to the reporting by type of support, with Parties reporting only on mitigation, adaptation and cross-cutting categories, without including other types of support. Nevertheless, improvements in aggregating geographic or sector-based information remains limited owing to differences in the approaches used by Parties and the functionality of the reporting system to allow differences in reporting. Several Parties referred to ongoing work to resolve challenges related to reporting on private finance mobilized by public interventions.  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.31" top="561.65"><span x0="113.4" y0="561.65" x1="484.31" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 561.65; y1: 571.61; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">12.Data coverage and granularity of reporting on climate finance received in the BURs of non-Annex I Parties has improved since the previous BA. Nineteen Parties have submitted a BUR for the first time since the previous BA, in addition to a further 27 Parties submitting second or third BURs. The proportion of BURs that include information on finance received rose from approximately 60 per cent in 2014 to over 90 per cent in 2019&#8211;2020. A total of 41 Parties have provided quantitative information on climate finance received at the project or activity level in tabular format. Many differences remain in the approaches Parties used for reporting, including time periods of reported data and information on types of support, sectors and financial instruments. Several Parties included additional information in their second and third BURs on whether a project is linked to capacity-building, technology development and transfer, or technical assistance. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="125.97" top="423.63"><span x0="113.4" y0="423.63" x1="125.97" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 423.63; y1: 433.59; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">13.</span><span x0="141.72" y0="423.42" x1="484.31" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 148.91; y0: 423.42; y1: 433.38; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Availability of domestic public climate finance data is increasing, with more countries establishing climate budget tagging systems</span><span x0="355.08" y0="411.63" x1="484.3" style="x0: 355.08; x1: 357.57; y0: 411.63; y1: 421.59; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. Notable improvements were observed in the tracking of domestic climate-related public or private finance flows, with the issuance of green sovereign bonds incentivizing the establishment of regular tracking systems in both developed and developing countries, building on previous work through CPEIRs. Thirteen countries have established tracking systems for national budgets, with a further five countries developing tracking methodologies. In total, estimates of domestic public expenditures on climate change in 2017&#8211;2018 amount to approximately USD 86.6 billion (see chap. III.B below).  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="125.97" top="309.62"><span x0="113.4" y0="309.62" x1="125.97" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 309.62; y1: 319.58; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">14.</span><span x0="141.72" y0="309.41" x1="484.34" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 149.47; y0: 309.41; y1: 319.37; width: 7.75; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Operational definitions of climate finance in use generally reflect a common understanding of what is considered mitigation or adaptation finance, but differ on the details of sector-specific activities, certain financial instruments and approaches to public and private finance flows</span><span x0="254.04" y0="273.61" x1="484.28" style="x0: 254.04; x1: 256.53; y0: 273.61; y1: 283.57; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">.Operational definitions of climate finance in use have evolved over time. The MDB list of activities eligible for classification as mitigation finance includes charging stations for electric vehicles and hydrogen or biofuel fuelling since 2017 and resource efficiency in aquaculture since 2018, while OECD DAC integrated adjustments to adaptation finance eligibility criteria in 2016 to harmonize with a stepwise approach developed by MDBs. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.24" top="195.61"><span x0="113.39" y0="195.61" x1="484.24" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 195.61; y1: 205.57; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">15.The lists of climate mitigation activities developed by MDBs have served in part to inform green or climate-aligned taxonomies in recent years to support the development of the green bond market and/or regulatory efforts in the field of sustainable finance to combat greenwashing and promote the standardization of financial products. Approaches to defining mitigation and adaptation activities are broadly consistent across various international organizations and regulatory initiatives, although inclusion and exclusion lists and approaches to the criteria used to define such activities can vary. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.25" top="105.6"><span x0="113.39" y0="105.6" x1="484.25" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 105.6; y1: 115.56; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">16.Parties&#8217; submissions on operational definitions of climate finance in use highlighted a range of views on the need for, and on the form and scope of, a common definition of climate finance. Some Parties noted that a single definition would not be useful, or should be broad enough to cater for the dynamic and evolving nature of climate finance due to a variety of factors, including NDCs and implementation of the enhanced transparency framework </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="783.0" width="484.8" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
