In these forums, it is important to reflect the perspectives of different regions, financial systems and country priorities in how common goals are articulated, particularly as the activities of these actors support and facilitate the achievement of the goal in Article 2, paragraph 1(c), as well as their country NDCs.  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="125.97" top="704.1"><span x0="113.4" y0="704.1" x1="125.97" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 704.1; y1: 714.06; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">59.</span><span x0="141.72" y0="703.89" x1="481.99" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 147.8; y0: 703.89; y1: 713.85; width: 6.09; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Pursuing consistency requires consideration of how finance targeted at GHG- intensive activities can support pathways</span><span x0="289.55" y0="692.1" x1="484.27" style="x0: 289.55; x1: 292.04; y0: 692.1; y1: 702.06; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. A focus on individual financing or investment decisions that are consistent with a pathway towards low GHG emission and climate-resilient development is not straightforward owing to the significant potential range of what pathways may be followed for achieving the broader goals in Article 2. The trend towards developing climate, green or sustainable finance taxonomies, as seen across multiple public actor initiatives, can support the identification of activities that are consistent with such pathways, but may risk excluding necessary investment in high-emission sectors or activities that can support the overall transition to such pathways. These may be in areas where activities that are consistent are not yet available at scale owing to technological innovation (e.g. steel and/or cement processes), where activities are needed to enable the transition (e.g. financing of mining activities, road building), or where financing is needed to wind down or responsibly manage the retiring of high-emission activities and transition communities away from their reliance (e.g. coal phase-out policies and subsidies). </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.24" top="530.08"><span x0="113.39" y0="530.08" x1="484.24" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 530.08; y1: 540.04; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">60.Transition finance taxonomies and transition bonds are being developed for private finance actors to finance, for example, transitional activities in the context of financing just transitions, which implies projects that meet certain conditions, such as displacing more carbon-intensive options compared with industry norms; and enabling wider application or integration of less-carbon-intensive options. </span></div><div left="113.38" right="125.95" top="464.07"><span x0="113.38" y0="464.07" x1="125.95" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 464.07; y1: 474.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">61.</span><span x0="141.7" y0="463.86" x1="484.28" style="x0: 141.7; x1: 147.78; y0: 463.86; y1: 473.82; width: 6.09; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Further consideration of climate-resilient development pathways is necessary to complement existing approaches</span><span x0="251.02" y0="452.07" x1="484.29" style="x0: 251.02; x1: 253.51; y0: 452.07; y1: 462.03; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">.The mapped approaches include a strong focus on actions linked to achieving the goal in Article 2, paragraph 1(a), of the Paris Agreement, namely financing investments related to low GHG emissions, and to mitigating the physical and transition-related risks of shifting from high- to low-emission development trajectories. There appears to be limited evidence of the degree to which financial actors are aligning their investment mandates with climate resilience goals linked to Article 2, paragraph 1(b), of the Paris Agreement. There is a view that focusing on proper climate-related risk disclosure should result in better, more resilient investment and financing decisions as an end in and of itself, while other views have recognized the existing gaps in guidance and understanding on how to proactively engage on this element.  </span></div><div left="113.38" right="125.95" top="326.06"><span x0="113.38" y0="326.06" x1="125.95" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 326.06; y1: 336.02; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">62.</span><span x0="141.7" y0="325.85" x1="484.22" style="x0: 141.7; x1: 147.23; y0: 325.85; y1: 335.81; width: 5.54; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Stakeholders may take action across a number of areas to support advancing efforts in relation to the goal in Article 2, paragraph 1(c)</span><span x0="354.22" y0="314.06" x1="420.2" style="x0: 354.22; x1: 356.71; y0: 314.06; y1: 324.02; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">.These include: </span></div><div left="141.71" right="484.28" top="296.06"><span x0="141.71" y0="296.06" x1="484.28" style="x0: 141.71; x1: 145.02; y0: 296.06; y1: 306.02; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(a)In public policy and finance, promoting opportunities to make sustainable recovery packages consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement in the short term and setting in place financial policies and regulations for achieving net zero commitments in the long term;  </span></div><div left="141.71" right="484.28" top="242.05"><span x0="141.71" y0="242.05" x1="484.28" style="x0: 141.71; x1: 145.02; y0: 242.05; y1: 252.01; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(b)Ensuring that just transition financing is incorporated into approaches to align action with the goals of the Paris Agreement or into classifications of consistency with those goals, including in supporting vulnerable developing countries at risk of climate impacts in gaining access to capital to support their climate-resilient development, and in supporting the shift of trade flows away from economic activities that are inconsistent with those goals; </span></div><div left="141.71" right="484.28" top="176.05"><span x0="141.71" y0="176.05" x1="484.28" style="x0: 141.71; x1: 145.02; y0: 176.05; y1: 186.01; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(c)Further clarifying the differences or complementarities between climate finance related to Article 9 of the Paris Agreement and the long-term goal under Article 2, paragraph 1(c).  </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="783.0" width="484.8" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
