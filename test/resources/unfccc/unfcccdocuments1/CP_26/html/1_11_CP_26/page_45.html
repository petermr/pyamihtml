This increases the risk of double counting, as cost estimates may be given in one report by sector and in another report by activity, so the same activity may be captured and hence accounted for under the costs by sector. Issues related to the definitions of needs also introduce inconsistencies because needs are referred to as qualitative needs, investment needs or costs; </span></div><div left="141.73" right="153.44" top="560.67"><span x0="141.73" y0="560.67" x1="153.44" style="x0: 141.73; x1: 145.05; y0: 560.67; y1: 570.63; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(b)</span><span x0="170.06" y0="560.46" x1="213.05" style="x0: 170.06; x1: 177.25; y0: 560.46; y1: 570.42; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0.094, 0.09, 0.09]; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Data gaps</span><span x0="213.01" y0="560.67" x1="484.28" style="x0: 213.01; x1: 215.78; y0: 560.67; y1: 570.63; width: 2.77; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0.094, 0.09, 0.09]; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">: gaps in the coverage of information on costed needs by sector or subsector pose a significant challenge. These gaps are particularly evident for adaptation needs, which, compared with cost estimates for mitigation, remain limited. Significant data gaps related to capacity-building needs remain; these are predominantly characterized in qualitative terms. Further, information on methodologies used in producing and communicating information on needs in national reports is, in many cases, not included in the reports. In addition, methodological assumptions, which in most cases are not stated, may impact the interpretation of the data. The needs are dynamically changing and may depend on different factors such as temperature scenarios, mitigation pathways and adaptive capacity, extreme weather events, adverse effects of trade and economic barriers, and social factors such as poverty. Most reports, however, provide a snapshot of a Party&#8217;s needs. It should also be noted that not all Parties have submitted reports; </span></div><div left="141.73" right="152.85" top="416.63"><span x0="141.73" y0="416.63" x1="152.85" style="x0: 141.73; x1: 145.05; y0: 416.63; y1: 426.59; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(c)</span><span x0="170.05" y0="416.42" x1="254.92" style="x0: 170.05; x1: 177.24; y0: 416.42; y1: 426.38; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0.094, 0.09, 0.09]; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Data interpretation</span><span x0="254.88" y0="416.63" x1="484.31" style="x0: 254.88; x1: 257.65; y0: 416.63; y1: 426.59; width: 2.77; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0.094, 0.09, 0.09]; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">: when collecting, analysing and aggregating data and information on the needs of developing country Parties, best efforts have been made to ensure accuracy. When collecting and analysing the amounts of needs reported by developing country Parties in their national reports, different Parties apply their respective definitions and interpretations of needs. Needs may be reported as needs or activities needed to take climate action. Furthermore, costed needs may be determined in one national report but not in the subsequent report, without stating whether the same amounts of costed needs apply. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="464.12" top="330.08"><span x0="113.4" y0="330.08" x1="464.12" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 330.08; y1: 340.04; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">60.The following steps were undertaken to analyse, aggregate and present the data: </span></div><div left="141.72" right="437.85" top="312.56"><span x0="141.72" y0="312.56" x1="437.85" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 145.04; y0: 312.56; y1: 322.52; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(a)Analysis of data gaps and identification of areas for improvement; </span></div><div left="141.72" right="484.28" top="295.16"><span x0="141.72" y0="295.16" x1="484.28" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 145.04; y0: 295.16; y1: 305.12; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(b)Harmonization of data sets used for estimating the global total needs in order to minimize misalignment between information and data according to thematic areas, regions, sectors and time frames; </span></div><div left="141.73" right="484.21" top="254.6"><span x0="141.73" y0="254.6" x1="484.21" style="x0: 141.73; x1: 145.05; y0: 254.6; y1: 264.56; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(c)Presentation of quantified data in ranges of estimates where possible, instead of aggregating the amounts, to avoid possible data overlaps; </span></div><div left="141.72" right="484.26" top="225.55"><span x0="141.72" y0="225.55" x1="484.26" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 145.04; y0: 225.55; y1: 235.51; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(d)Use of case studies to highlight good practices and lessons learned in determining needs. </span></div><div left="87.01" right="322.19" top="190.18"><span x0="87.01" y0="190.18" x1="322.19" style="x0: 87.01; x1: 90.33; y0: 190.18; y1: 200.14; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">(b)Challenges experienced by developing countries  </span></div><div left="113.41" right="484.33" top="172.63"><span x0="113.41" y0="172.63" x1="484.33" style="x0: 113.41; x1: 118.39; y0: 172.63; y1: 182.59; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">61.Institutional coordination was highlighted as a major challenge in the needs determination process. The coordination challenge affected needs identification between sectors and between levels of governance, namely the local and national level. Two of the identified drivers of limited coordination were the lack of specialized institutions within ministries with the mandate to spearhead climate change actions, and the involvement of ministries other than the environment ministry in climate change planning in the needs identification process. </span></div><div left="113.41" right="484.31" top="86.09"><span x0="113.41" y0="86.09" x1="484.31" style="x0: 113.41; x1: 118.39; y0: 86.09; y1: 96.05; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">62.While most countries have used methodologies to identify and report their needs both qualitatively and quantitatively, costing these needs has been a major challenge and therefore most of these needs do not have accompanying cost estimates.
