A smaller pool of approximately 31 initiatives are focused on greening financial systems &#8211; for example, the TCFD, the European Union High Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance and the NGFS.  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.33" top="716.1"><span x0="113.4" y0="716.1" x1="484.33" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 716.1; y1: 726.06; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">52.Many activities across the stakeholder mapping exercise that explicitly refer to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and Article 2, paragraph 1(c), in particular are executed through collective initiatives and organizations. This highlights the importance of network effects, knowledge-sharing and common goal setting. In contrast, relatively few relevant actions by national Governments are framed in the context of Article 2, paragraph 1(c). Particularly in developing countries, the ability to access international climate finance in the context of Article 9 is mentioned, as is directing domestic finance flows towards achieving NDC goals.  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="125.97" top="614.09"><span x0="113.4" y0="614.09" x1="125.97" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 614.09; y1: 624.05; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">53.</span><span x0="141.72" y0="613.88" x1="484.27" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 148.91; y0: 613.88; y1: 623.84; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Assessing the real-economy impact and the risk of greenwashing remains a challenge</span><span x0="153.35" y0="602.09" x1="484.36" style="x0: 153.35; x1: 155.84; y0: 602.09; y1: 612.05; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. Efforts relevant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), are widespread across all actors within the financial sector, with actions concentrated on defining their exposure to climate risks and the economic opportunities linked to climate response measures. However, achieving the goal in Article 2, paragraph 1(c), related to low GHG emission and climate-resilient development, set in the context of Article 2, depends on real-economy actions that reduce emissions in line with temperature goals and help to develop climate resilience. Many actors in the financial sector operate at a number of steps removed from real-economy activities, through stock or bond trading, portfolio allocations, or micro-prudential supervision, which has little direct effect on real-economy investment decisions relative to banks lending to projects, corporations approving capital expenditure plans or governments announcing support incentives. Therefore, measuring the effective role of financial actors in the context of Article 2, paragraph 1(c), is a notable topic of debate among initiatives, including which metrics are most important as indicators of success. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.27" top="440.07"><span x0="113.39" y0="440.07" x1="484.27" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 440.07; y1: 450.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">54.Several researchers highlight the absence of any independent critique of the motives and impacts of the numerous finance-related initiatives that have emerged since the adoption of the Paris Agreement. Such critical engagement will assist in assessing the real-economy contributions of these initiatives towards achieving consistency of finance flows and combating greenwashing in this context. Further, a plethora of initiatives offers the potential for incoherence and different levels of ambition in articulating how the goal in Article 2, paragraph 1(c), may be met. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.28" top="350.06"><span x0="113.39" y0="350.06" x1="484.28" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 350.06; y1: 360.02; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">55.The most recent initiatives include efforts of respective stakeholders to align with net zero emissions or 1.5 &#176;C temperature rise pathways, with a focus on commitments for target setting and reporting, in contrast to earlier initiatives that focused on advocacy and high-level commitments.  </span></div><div left="113.39" right="125.96" top="296.06"><span x0="113.39" y0="296.06" x1="125.96" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 296.06; y1: 306.02; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">56.</span><span x0="141.71" y0="295.85" x1="484.33" style="x0: 141.71; x1: 148.35; y0: 295.85; y1: 305.81; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Trend towards activities with more stringent minimum requirements or mandatory regulations over voluntary activities</span><span x0="318.35" y0="284.06" x1="484.27" style="x0: 318.35; x1: 320.84; y0: 284.06; y1: 294.02; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">.Actors are largely adopting approaches in line with their institutional mandates, geographical reach and interpretation of how climate risks and opportunities affect and benefit their operations. To date, initiatives with the widest coverage and scope among financial actors are voluntary in nature, often with non-prescriptive commitments to principles. More recently, some initiatives include mandatory implementation requirements against common timelines. Furthermore, some Governments have already signalled that mandatory exclusions or obligations are being placed on institutions, although these remain limited in number and geographical scope.  </span></div><div left="113.39" right="125.96" top="182.05"><span x0="113.39" y0="182.05" x1="125.96" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 182.05; y1: 192.01; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">57.</span><span x0="141.71" y0="181.84" x1="468.53" style="x0: 141.71; x1: 151.11; y0: 181.84; y1: 191.8; width: 9.4; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">More work needed to promote inclusivity and geographical representation</span><span x0="468.46" y0="182.05" x1="484.28" style="x0: 468.46; x1: 470.95; y0: 182.05; y1: 192.01; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. A number of initiatives relevant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), include representation from different regions and both developed and developing countries. For private finance actors, such representation is important, and it reveals how different relative starting points, capacity and skills gaps exist within coalitions that make common commitments. Further, although a significant number of initiatives were identified, many have yet to combine networks to achieve greater effect. Of the 115 partnerships identified of relevance to supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement, with up to 5,181 constituent members, the vast majority (75 per cent) are connected to only one partnership.  </span></div><div left="113.38" right="484.28" top="68.03"><span x0="113.38" y0="68.03" x1="484.28" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 68.03; y1: 77.99; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">58.Inclusive and broad geographic representation is even more critical among relevant initiatives targeted at public finance actors, regulators and other country-focused actors such </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="783.0" width="484.8" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
