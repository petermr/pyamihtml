Building codes, design standards and disaster risk management guidelines play a role in furthering climate resilience within infrastructure and development investments. Furthermore, local and context-specific vulnerabilities require local-level data and information systems on risks to drive investment, particularly in agricultural adaptation activities.  </span></div><div left="113.39" right="125.96" top="638.09"><span x0="113.39" y0="638.09" x1="125.96" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 638.09; y1: 648.05; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">45.</span><span x0="141.71" y0="637.89" x1="484.28" style="x0: 141.71; x1: 148.9; y0: 637.89; y1: 647.85; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Although climate finance flows are increasing, they remain relatively small in the broader context of other finance flows, investment opportunities and costs</span><span x0="443.5" y0="626.09" x1="484.27" style="x0: 443.5; x1: 445.99; y0: 626.09; y1: 636.05; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. Climate finance accounts for just a small proportion of overall finance flows, as shown in figure 3. The level of climate finance is considerably below what would be expected in view of the investment opportunities and needs that have been identified. However, although climate finance flows must obviously be scaled up, it is also important to ensure the consistency of finance flows as a whole (and of capital stock) with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, specifically those set out in its Article 2. </span></div><div left="113.38" right="125.95" top="536.08"><span x0="113.38" y0="536.08" x1="125.95" style="x0: 113.38; x1: 118.36; y0: 536.08; y1: 546.04; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">46.</span><span x0="141.7" y0="535.87" x1="479.27" style="x0: 141.7; x1: 147.78; y0: 535.87; y1: 545.83; width: 6.09; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Financial flows and stocks in GHG-intensive activities remain concerningly high</span><span x0="479.25" y0="536.08" x1="484.26" style="x0: 479.25; x1: 481.74; y0: 536.08; y1: 546.04; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. Fossil fuel investments amounted globally to USD 977 billion in 2017–2018, while fossil fuel subsidies amounted to USD 472 billion in 2018. Fossil fuel corporate capital expenditure at risk of becoming stranded amounted to USD 50 billion in 2018, while investments with deforestation risks amounted to USD 43.8 billion in 2017–2018, and net agriculture subsidies amounted to USD 619 billion per year on average from 2017 to 2019. Fixed assets in sectors linked to fossil fuel systems amounted to USD 32 trillion, real estate assets at risk in 2070 amounted to USD 35 trillion, and stranded assets worth USD 20 trillion are at risk out to 2050. </span></div><div left="113.37" right="484.22" top="422.07"><span x0="113.37" y0="422.07" x1="484.22" style="x0: 113.37; x1: 118.35; y0: 422.07; y1: 432.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">47.Given the scale and speed needed for the transformation to low GHG emission and climate-resilient development pathways, it is critical to consider climate finance flows within the context of broader finance flows. A sole focus on positive climate finance flows will be insufficient to meet the overarching objectives of the Paris Agreement. This does not mean that broader finance flows must all have explicit beneficial climate outcomes, but it does mean that they must integrate climate risks into decision-making and avoid increasing the likelihood of negative climate outcomes. Without this, the effectiveness of climate finance flows can be called into question or even negated. </span></div><div left="87.48" right="480.48" top="306.26"><span x0="87.48" y0="306.26" x1="480.48" style="x0: 87.48; x1: 96.14; y0: 306.26; y1: 318.26; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">D.Mapping information relevant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), of the Paris Agreement  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.32" top="269.1"><span x0="113.4" y0="269.1" x1="484.32" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 269.1; y1: 279.06; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">48.Article 2 of the Paris Agreement sets out three interlinked goals aimed at strengthening the global response to climate change in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty: (1) limiting the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels; (2) increasing the ability to adapt to and foster resilience against the adverse impacts of climate change; and (3) in Article 2, paragraph 1(c), making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. Article 2 states that the Paris Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity, and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.0" y1="783.0" y2="783.0"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
