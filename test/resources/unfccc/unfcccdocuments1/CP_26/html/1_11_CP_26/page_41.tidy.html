Three to fourfold increases of investment are necessary in both renewable energy and energy efficiency across many regions that include developing countries. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.35" top="399.65"><span x0="113.39" y0="399.65" x1="484.35" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 399.65; y1: 409.61; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">35.Regional and global reports also provide estimates related to adaptation and resilience. Costs based on bottom-up national and sector-based studies (ranging from USD 140 billion to USD 300 billion annually by 2030) measuring impacts to GDP (for example, ranging from USD 289.2 billion to USD 440.5 billion up to 2030 in Africa) and the incremental investment needed to upgrade or retrofit infrastructure stock (ranging from USD 11 billion to USD 670 billion in annual incremental costs) are most prevalent. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.29" top="324.63"><span x0="113.4" y0="324.63" x1="484.29" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 324.63; y1: 334.59; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">36.To make current and future infrastructure climate-resilient, annual costs as a percentage of GDP are at least double in countries with emerging market economies, low-income countries and small States compared with the costs in high-income countries, that is 1.1–1.49 per cent compared with 0.45 per cent. Investment needs expressed as a percentage of GDP for upgrading new infrastructure and coastal protection are proportionally greater in lower-income countries and small States, while retrofitting existing infrastructure is the major cost component in countries with emerging market economies. However, the reports also noted that specific knowledge on the degree of exposure of infrastructure to natural hazards, related to their location, intensity and level of risk, could affect the incremental cost of making infrastructure climate-resilient (e.g. 3 per cent of total investment as opposed to 8–45 per cent) (see figure 5).</span><span x0="229.92" y0="213.92" x1="235.92" style="x0: 229.92; x1: 232.92; y0: 213.92; y1: 219.92; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">12</span></div><div left="101.64" right="107.64" top="60.08"><span x0="101.64" y0="60.08" x1="107.64" style="x0: 101.64; x1: 104.64; y0: 60.08; y1: 66.08; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">12</span><span x0="113.28" y0="56.16" x1="197.25" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 119.78; y0: 56.16; y1: 65.16; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">As footnote 11 above.  </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.0" y1="783.0" y2="783.0"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="113.28" x2="371.639" y1="485.04" y2="485.04"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="56.64" x2="200.64" y1="71.88" y2="71.88"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
