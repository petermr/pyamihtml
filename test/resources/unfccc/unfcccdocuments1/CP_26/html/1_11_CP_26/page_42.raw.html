However, all of the reports may be viewed as complementary in offering different insights, granularity and processes and approaches for identifying needs. </span></div><div left="88.2" right="459.12" top="505.22"><span x0="88.2" y0="505.22" x1="459.12" style="x0: 88.2; x1: 96.2; y0: 505.22; y1: 517.22; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">B.Processes and approaches for determination of needs of developing country Parties </span></div><div left="91.68" right="268.65" top="468.21"><span x0="91.68" y0="468.21" x1="268.65" style="x0: 91.68; x1: 96.66; y0: 468.21; y1: 478.17; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">1.National institutional arrangements </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.31" top="450.66"><span x0="113.4" y0="450.66" x1="484.31" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 450.66; y1: 460.62; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">38.Developing country Parties have varied institutional arrangements for identifying climate change needs, which are described in most of their national reports submitted to the UNFCCC. Most countries have established specialized institutions within their ministries and departments whose mandate is to spearhead climate change actions. These institutions have various names such as climate change directorate, climate change unit, interministerial climate change coordination committee, climate change technical working group and climate research centre. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.29" top="364.12"><span x0="113.4" y0="364.12" x1="484.29" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 364.12; y1: 374.08; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">39.Good practice in ensuring buy-in and effective coordination of the needs identification process is the engagement of high-level decision-making government offices at the initial stage of the climate change needs identification process. In addition, the engagement of other stakeholders and the assignment of specific roles and responsibilities to participants representing various sectors and interest groups at both the national and subnational level was noted in the reports of the majority of developing countries. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.28" top="289.1"><span x0="113.39" y0="289.1" x1="484.28" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 289.1; y1: 299.06; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">40.Institutional arrangements for needs determination vary widely across countries. However, in most countries the ministry responsible for environmental affairs coordinates the process through a focal point or a committee. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.24" top="248.65"><span x0="113.39" y0="248.65" x1="484.24" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 248.65; y1: 258.61; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">41.The focal point leads the needs identification process and can adopt varying arrangements for stakeholder consultation. The stakeholder consultation process leads to determining the institutional arrangements for the needs identification process. Some of the most common institutional arrangements include focal point only, focal point with other ministries and an interministerial committee. Among these, the interministerial committee is the most inclusive and likely to provide more detailed information on needs across sectors. </span></div><div left="91.67" right="234.81" top="167.18"><span x0="91.67" y0="167.18" x1="234.81" style="x0: 91.67; x1: 96.65; y0: 167.18; y1: 177.14; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: AHCIDX+TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">2.Needs identification process </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.27" top="149.63"><span x0="113.39" y0="149.63" x1="484.27" style="x0: 113.39; x1: 118.37; y0: 149.63; y1: 159.59; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: UZYEXJ+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">42.The needs identification process of most countries starts with consultations between the lead ministry and the country&#8217;s leadership. This ensures country ownership and top-level support in the needs identification process (see figure 6). </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="783.0" width="484.8" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
