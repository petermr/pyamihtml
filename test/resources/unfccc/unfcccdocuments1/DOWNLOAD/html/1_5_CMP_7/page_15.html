Parties shall make technical corrections, if necessary, to ensure consistency, including applying IPCC methods for ensuring time-series consistency (e.g. overlap with historical data) and shall report on how these corrections were made. Information on technical corrections and methodological consistency shall be reported as part of the annual greenhouse gas inventories and inventory reports, in accordance with relevant decisions under Articles 5 and 7 of the Kyoto Protocol, and reviewed as part of the review of the annual greenhouse gas inventory review in accordance with relevant decisions under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.37" top="565.12"><span x0="113.4" y0="565.12" x1="484.37" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 565.12; y1: 575.08; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: Times-Roman;">15.After adoption of the reference level for forest management, if the reported data on forest management or forest land remaining forest land used to establish the reference level are subject to recalculations, a technical correction shall be applied to include in the accounting the impact of the recalculations on the reported data that have been used by the Party to set the reference level.  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.31" top="499.12"><span x0="113.4" y0="499.12" x1="484.31" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.38; y0: 499.12; y1: 509.08; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: Times-Roman;">16.Emissions that occur during the second commitment period from harvested wood products removed from forests prior to the start of the second commitment period shall also be accounted for.

Emissions from harvested wood products already accounted for during the first commitment period on the basis of instantaneous oxidation shall be excluded.
