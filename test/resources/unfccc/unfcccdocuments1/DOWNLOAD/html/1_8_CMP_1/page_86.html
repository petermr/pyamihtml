A small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM is additional if the actual net greenhouse gas removals by sinks are increased above the sum of the changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the project boundary that would have occurred in the absence of the registered small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="542.34" top="658.61"><span x0="85.08" y0="658.61" x1="542.34" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 658.61; y1: 669.65; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">19. The baseline for a proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM is the scenario that reasonably represents the sum of the changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the project boundary that would have occurred in the absence of the proposed project activity.  A baseline shall be deemed to reasonably represent the sum of the changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the project boundary that would occur in the absence of the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM if it is derived using a baseline methodology referred to in appendix B. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="521.83" top="558.89"><span x0="85.08" y0="558.89" x1="521.83" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 558.89; y1: 569.93; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">20. A simplified baseline and monitoring methodology listed in appendix B may be used for a small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM if the project participants are able to demonstrate to a DOE that the project activity would otherwise not be implemented due to the existence of one or more of the barriers listed in attachment A to appendix B.  Where specified in appendix B for a project type, quantitative evidence that the project activity would otherwise not be implemented may be provided instead of a demonstration based on the barriers listed in attachment A to appendix B. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="524.22" top="459.17"><span x0="85.08" y0="459.17" x1="524.22" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 459.17; y1: 470.21; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">21.
