As presented in the attachment to annex 2 of the annotated agenda of the third meeting of the Executive Board, type (iii) CDM project activities could include agricultural projects, fuel switching, industrial processes and waste management.  Possible examples in the agricultural sector include improved manure management, reduction of enteric fermentation, improved fertilizer usage or improved water management in rice cultivation. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="356.52" top="680.57"><span x0="85.08" y0="680.57" x1="356.52" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 680.57; y1: 691.61; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">6.

The Board agreed that the three types of project activities outlined in decision 17/CP.7, paragraph 6 (c), are mutually exclusive.  In a project activity with more than one component that will benefit from simplified CDM modalities and procedures, each component shall meet the threshold criterion of each applicable type, e.g. for a project with both a renewable energy and an energy efficiency component, the renewable energy component shall meet the criterion for &#8220;renewable energy&#8221; and the energy efficiency component that for &#8220;energy efficiency&#8221;. </span></div><div left="119.64" right="513.17" top="484.85"><span x0="119.64" y0="484.85" x1="513.17" style="x0: 119.64; x1: 127.0; y0: 484.85; y1: 495.89; width: 7.36; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Bold;">E.
