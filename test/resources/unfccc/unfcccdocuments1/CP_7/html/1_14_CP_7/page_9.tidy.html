Such centres can incorporate traditional skills, knowledge and practices, to provide appropriate services in developing countries and facilitate information sharing.  Whenever possible and effective, therefore, capacity building should mobilize these existing national, subregional and regional institutions and the private sector in developing countries, and build on existing processes and endogenous capacities.</span></div><div left="85.17" right="531.04" top="238.39"><span x0="85.17" y0="238.39" x1="531.04" style="x0: 85.17; x1: 91.17; y0: 238.39; y1: 250.39; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times-Roman;">12.National coordinating mechanisms and focal points and national coordinating entities have an important role to play in ensuring coordination at the country and regional levels and may serve as the focal point for coordinating capacity-building activities.</span></div><div left="85.17" right="551.71" top="186.91"><span x0="85.17" y0="186.91" x1="551.71" style="x0: 85.17; x1: 91.17; y0: 186.91; y1: 198.91; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times-Roman;">13.Multilateral and bilateral bodies are encouraged to take account of this framework in their consultations with developing countries when supporting capacity-building activities related to the implementation of the Convention and the preparation for the effective participation by developing countries in the Kyoto Protocol process.</span></div></body></html>
