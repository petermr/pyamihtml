They involve different stakeholders in a consultative process to identify the barriers to technology transfer and measures to address these barriers through sectoral analyses.  These activities may address soft and hard technologies, such as mitigation and adaptation technologies, identify regulatory options and develop fiscal and financial incentives and capacity building.</span></div><div left="85.17" right="125.17" top="279.55"><span x0="85.17" y0="279.55" x1="125.17" style="x0: 85.17; x1: 92.5; y0: 279.55; y1: 291.55; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times-Italic;">Purpose</span></div><div left="85.17" right="529.85" top="256.39"><span x0="85.17" y0="256.39" x1="529.85" style="x0: 85.17; x1: 91.17; y0: 256.39; y1: 268.39; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times-Roman;">4.The purpose of technology needs assessments is to assist in identifying and analysing priority technology needs, which can form the basis for a portfolio of EST projects and programmes which can facilitate the transfer of, and access to, the ESTs and know-how in the implementation of Article 4, paragraph 5, of the Convention.</span></div><div left="85.17" right="160.37" top="190.75"><span x0="85.17" y0="190.75" x1="160.37" style="x0: 85.17; x1: 89.17; y0: 190.75; y1: 202.75; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times-Italic;">Implementation</span></div><div left="85.17" right="545.51" top="167.59"><span x0="85.17" y0="167.59" x1="545.51" style="x0: 85.17; x1: 91.17; y0: 167.59; y1: 179.59; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times-Roman;">5.Parties other than developed country Parties, and other developed Parties not included in Annex II, particularly developing country Parties, are encouraged to undertake assessments of country-specific technology needs, subject to the provision of resources, as appropriate to country-specific circumstances, from developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in Annex II.
