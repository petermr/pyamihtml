In some cases it may not be possible to use the same methods and consistent data sets for all years, owing to a possible lack of AD, EFs or other parameters directly used in the calculation of emission estimates for some historical years, including the base year. In such cases, emissions or removals may need to be recalculated using alternative methods not generally covered by paragraph 9 above. In these instances, Annex I Parties should use one of the techniques provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines to estimate the missing values. Annex I Parties should document and report the methodologies used for the entire time series. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="248.73" top="607.11"><span x0="113.4" y0="607.11" x1="248.73" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 120.59; y0: 607.11; y1: 617.07; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGHPG+TimesNewRoman;">Quality assurance/quality control </span></div><div left="113.28" right="484.35" top="589.13"><span x0="113.28" y0="589.13" x1="484.35" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 118.26; y0: 589.13; y1: 599.09; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGHPG+TimesNewRoman;">19. Each Annex I Party shall elaborate an inventory quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) plan and implement general inventory QC procedures in accordance with its QA/QC plan following the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. In addition, Annex I Parties should apply category-specific QC procedures for key categories and for those individual categories in which significant methodological changes and/or data revisions have occurred, in accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. In addition, Annex I Parties should implement QA procedures by conducting a basic expert peer review of their inventories in accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. </span></div><div left="88.8" right="286.89" top="473.49"><span x0="88.8" y0="473.49" x1="286.89" style="x0: 88.8; x1: 96.13; y0: 473.49; y1: 485.49; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGIBH+TimesNewRoman,Bold;">F.
