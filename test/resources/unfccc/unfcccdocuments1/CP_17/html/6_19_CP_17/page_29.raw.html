The 2006 IPCC Guidelines provide default methodologies which include default EFs and in some cases default AD for the categories to be reported. As the assumptions implicit in these default data, factors and methods may not be appropriate for specific national circumstances, Annex I Parties should use their own national EFs and AD, where available, provided that they are developed in a manner consistent with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and are considered to be more accurate than the defaults. If Annex I Parties lack country-specific information, they could also use EFs or other parameters provided in the IPCC Emission Factor Database, where available, provided that they can demonstrate that those parameters are appropriate in the specific national circumstances and are more accurate than the default data provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Annex I Parties shall transparently explain in their annual GHG inventory submissions what data and/or parameters have been used. </span></div><div left="113.28" right="484.2" top="517.11"><span x0="113.28" y0="517.11" x1="484.2" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 118.26; y0: 517.11; y1: 527.07; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGHPG+TimesNewRoman;">13.

Annex I Parties shall quantitatively estimate the uncertainty of the data used for all source and sink categories using at least approach 1, as provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, and report uncertainties for at least the base year and the latest inventory year and the trend uncertainty between these two years. Annex I Parties are encouraged to use approach 2 or a hybrid of approaches 1 and 2 provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, in order to address technical limitations of approach 1. The uncertainty of the data used for all source and sink categories should also be qualitatively discussed in a transparent manner in the NIR, in particular for categories that were identified as key categories. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="287.13" top="259.12"><span x0="113.4" y0="259.12" x1="287.13" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 120.05; y0: 259.12; y1: 269.08; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGHPG+TimesNewRoman;">Recalculations and time-series consistency </span></div><div left="113.28" right="484.27" top="241.13"><span x0="113.28" y0="241.13" x1="484.27" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 118.26; y0: 241.13; y1: 251.09; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGHPG+TimesNewRoman;">16. The inventory for a time series, including the base year and all subsequent years for which the inventory has been reported, should be estimated using the same methodologies, and the underlying AD and EFs should be obtained and used in a consistent manner, ensuring that changes in emission trends are not introduced as a result of changes in estimation methods or assumptions over the time series of estimates. </span></div><div left="113.28" right="484.3" top="175.13"><span x0="113.28" y0="175.13" x1="484.3" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 118.26; y0: 175.13; y1: 185.09; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGHPG+TimesNewRoman;">17. Recalculations should ensure the consistency of the time series and shall be carried out to improve accuracy and/or completeness. Where the methodology or manner in which underlying AD and EFs are gathered has changed, Annex I Parties should recalculate their inventories for the base year and subsequent years of the times series. Annex I Parties should evaluate the need for recalculations relative to the reasons provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, in particular for key categories.
