The CRF tables are designed to ensure that Annex I Parties report quantitative data in a standardized format and to facilitate comparison of inventory data and trends. Explanation of information of a qualitative character should mainly be provided in the NIR rather than in the CRF tables. Such explanatory information should be cross-referenced to the specific chapter of the NIR. </span></div><div left="113.28" right="484.32" top="661.13"><span x0="113.28" y0="661.13" x1="484.32" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 118.26; y0: 661.13; y1: 671.09; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGHPG+TimesNewRoman;">53. Annex I Parties shall submit annually to the COP, through the secretariat, the information required in the CRF tables, as contained in annex II to decision 15/CP.17. This information shall be electronically submitted on an annual basis in its entirety to the COP, through the secretariat, in accordance with the relevant decisions of the COP. Parties should submit their CRF tables, generated by the CRF Reporter software, via the UNFCCC submission portal, with a view to facilitating the processing of the inventory information by the secretariat. </span></div><div left="113.28" right="484.36" top="571.12"><span x0="113.28" y0="571.12" x1="484.36" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 118.26; y0: 571.12; y1: 581.08; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGHPG+TimesNewRoman;">54. The CRF is a standardized format for reporting estimates of GHG emissions and removals and other relevant information. The CRF allows for the improved handling of electronic submissions and facilitates the processing of inventory information and the preparation of useful technical analysis and synthesis documentation. </span></div><div left="113.28" right="484.32" top="517.11"><span x0="113.28" y0="517.11" x1="484.32" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 118.26; y0: 517.11; y1: 527.07; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGHPG+TimesNewRoman;">55. The CRF tables shall be reported in accordance with the tables included in annex II to decision 15/CP.17 and as specified in these reporting guidelines.

If the information in those tables differs for each reported year, then either the tables or information on the specific changes must be provided for each year in the CRF tables; </span></div><div left="141.72" right="484.27" top="391.11"><span x0="141.72" y0="391.11" x1="484.27" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 145.04; y0: 391.11; y1: 401.07; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGHPG+TimesNewRoman;">(c) Use the documentation boxes provided at the foot of the sectoral report and background data tables to provide cross references to detailed explanations in the NIR, or any other information, as specified in those boxes. </span></div><div left="113.28" right="484.31" top="349.11"><span x0="113.28" y0="349.11" x1="484.31" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 118.26; y0: 349.11; y1: 359.07; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGHPG+TimesNewRoman;">56. Annex I Parties should provide the information requested in the additional information boxes. Where the information called for is inappropriate because of the methodological tier used by the Annex I Party, the corresponding cells should be completed using the notation key &#8220;NA&#8221;. In such cases, the Annex I Parties should cross-reference in the documentation box the relevant chapter in the NIR where equivalent information can be found. </span></div><div left="113.28" right="484.16" top="271.1"><span x0="113.28" y0="271.1" x1="484.16" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 118.26; y0: 271.1; y1: 281.06; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGHPG+TimesNewRoman;">57. Annex I Parties should use the notation keys, as specified in paragraph 37 above, in all the CRF tables to fill in the cells where no quantitative data are directly entered. Using the notation keys in this way facilitates the assessment of the completeness of an inventory.  </span></div><div left="86.76" right="197.65" top="215.49"><span x0="86.76" y0="215.49" x1="197.65" style="x0: 86.76; x1: 96.1; y0: 215.49; y1: 227.49; width: 9.34; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: IIGIBH+TimesNewRoman,Bold;">H.

Annex I Parties should gather and archive all relevant inventory information for each year of the reported time series, including all disaggregated EFs and AD, and documentation on how those factors and data were generated, including expert judgement where appropriate, and how they have been aggregated for their reporting in the inventory. This information should allow for the reconstruction of the inventory by the expert review teams. Inventory information should be archived from the base year and should include corresponding data on the recalculations applied.
