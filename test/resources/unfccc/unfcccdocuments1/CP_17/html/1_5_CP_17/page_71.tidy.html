The TEC should identify stakeholders for each technology area, taking into consideration that the CTCN, intergovernmental organizations and other technology actors at the national level would be important partners in undertaking the function of developing technology road maps, while general technology cooperation would be an area where international organizations, the private sector, non-governmental organizations and research communities could have an important role to play. </span></div><div left="113.28" right="484.2" top="382.12"><span x0="113.28" y0="382.12" x1="484.2" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 118.26; y0: 382.12; y1: 392.08; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KAODLL+TimesNewRoman;">11. The TEC should establish a procedure to involve stakeholders with regard to providing information on cooperative activities including experiences shared, lessons learned and opportunities for collaboration in facilitating and catalysing specific issues on the development and transfer of technologies.

The TEC acknowledged the need to achieve coherence and maintain interactions with other relevant institutional arrangements under and outside of the Convention as requested by decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 125. Without prejudicing the outcome of the negotiations between Parties on the possible relationships and linkages between the TEC and the CTCN, the financial mechanism and other institutional arrangements under the Convention being negotiated under the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention, the TEC agreed to reconsider its modalities on these matters at its first meeting to be held in 2012, in the light of an expected agreed outcome in this regard at the seventeenth session of the COP. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.199" x2="539.999" y1="768.761" y2="768.761"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
