The Fund will contribute to the achievement of the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In the context of sustainable development, the Fund will promote the paradigm shift towards low-emission and climate-resilient development pathways by providing support to developing countries to limit or reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change, taking into account the needs of those developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. </span></div><div left="113.28" right="484.25" top="473.68"><span x0="113.28" y0="473.68" x1="484.25" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 118.26; y0: 473.68; y1: 483.64; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KAODLL+TimesNewRoman;">3. The Fund will be guided by the principles and provisions of the Convention. The Fund will operate in a transparent and accountable manner guided by efficiency and effectiveness. The Fund will play a key role in channelling new, additional, adequate and predictable financial resources to developing countries and will catalyse climate finance, both public and private, and at the international and national levels. The Fund will pursue a country-driven approach and promote and strengthen engagement at the country level through effective involvement of relevant institutions and stakeholders. The Fund will be scalable and flexible and will be a continuously learning institution guided by processes for monitoring and evaluation. The Fund will strive to maximize the impact of its funding for adaptation and mitigation, and seek a balance between the two, while promoting environmental, social, economic and development co-benefits and taking a gender-sensitive approach. </span></div><div left="84.84" right="377.93" top="308.41"><span x0="84.84" y0="308.41" x1="377.93" style="x0: 84.84; x1: 90.31; y0: 308.41; y1: 322.45; width: 5.46; font-size: 14.04; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KAODLJ+TimesNewRoman,Bold;">II.
