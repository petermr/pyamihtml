Emissions of other greenhouse gases associated with these activities should also be listed, as appropriate. Historical trends should be included where available.

The national communications should describe all of a Party's policies and measures implemented or committed to that the Party believes contribute significantly to its efforts to reduce emissions and enhance sinks of greenhouse gases.
