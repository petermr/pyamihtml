Both adjusted and unadjusted data should be provided.</span></div><div left="84.96" right="547.06" top="580.46"><span x0="84.96" y0="580.46" x1="547.06" style="x0: 84.96; x1: 90.72; y0: 580.46; y1: 591.98; width: 5.76; font-size: 11.52; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: Times-Roman;">13.Parties should also provide greenhouse gas inventory information for years subsequent to 1990. Data should be provided for each year (where appropriate, updated) for the period 1990- 1994 and, where available, for 1995, for the second national communication. Subsequent national communications should provide data from 1990 and up to three years prior to the submission year, and, if possible, later years. If possible, data should also be provided in anelectronic version which is compatible with the requirements of the secretariat. 14.The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories should be used in estimating, reporting and verifying inventory data. These inventory guidelines offer a default methodology available to any country that wishes to use it. Countries that already have an established and comparable methodology could continue to use that methodology, provided that they include sufficient documentation to back up the data presented. For Parties using the CORINAIR methodology or other "bottom-up" approaches, this would entail providing activity data and disaggregated emission factors as well as details of the correspondence between theIPCC source categories and those of the CORINAIR or other "bottom-up" approach used. Standard tables and formats recommended in the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories should be used for presentation of data.</span></div><div left="84.96" right="528.73" top="342.86"><span x0="84.96" y0="342.86" x1="528.73" style="x0: 84.96; x1: 90.72; y0: 342.86; y1: 354.38; width: 5.76; font-size: 11.52; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: Times-Roman;">15.With regard to possible double counting or non-counting of emissions, Parties should provide a brief description of how feedstocks have been considered in the industrial processes source category of the inventory, in particular in the production of iron and steel and non-ferrous metals, and in the chemical and petro-chemical industry.

Annex I Parties should follow the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories with respect to the presentation of methodologies, activity data, emission factors and other assumptions. Standard data tables do not provide the level ofdetail necessary to enable the reconstruction of an inventory. In this connection, </span></div></body></html>
