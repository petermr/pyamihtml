This step shall involve an assessment of how the injected carbon dioxide can be expected to behave within the geological storage site architecture and surrounding domains, with a particular focus on the risk of seepage. This step shall utilize numerical dynamic modelling of the injected carbon dioxide using the static model developed in step 2 above to assess coupled processes (i.e. the interaction between each single process in the model), and, where possible, reactive processes (e.g. the interaction of injected carbon dioxide with in situ minerals in the numerical model),  and short- and long-term simulations. Such numerical modelling shall be used to provide insight into the pressure and extent of carbon dioxide in the geological storage site over time, the risk of fracturing the cap rock formation(s) and the risk of seepage. Multiple simulations shall be conducted to identify the sensitivity of the assessments to assumptions made. The simulations carried out in this step shall form the basis for risk and safety assessments, detailed in paragraphs 6 to 9 below; </span></div><div left="141.78" right="484.55" top="553.04"><span x0="141.78" y0="553.04" x1="484.55" style="x0: 141.78; x1: 145.12; y0: 553.04; y1: 563.06; width: 3.34; font-size: 10.02; font-family: FDDLHD+TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(d) Step 4: establishment of a site development and management plan.
