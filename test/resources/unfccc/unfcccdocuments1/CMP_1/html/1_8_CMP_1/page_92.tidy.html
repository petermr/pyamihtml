Debundling is defined as the fragmentation of a large project activity into smaller parts.  A small-scale project activity that is part of a large project activity is not eligible to use the simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism (CDM).  A large project activity or any of its components shall follow the regular modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="535.38" top="626.57"><span x0="85.08" y0="626.57" x1="535.38" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 626.57; y1: 637.61; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">2. A proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM shall be deemed to be a debundled component of a large project activity if there is a registered small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM or an application to register another afforestation or reforestation small-scale project activity under the CDM: </span></div><div left="121.08" right="315.06" top="565.73"><span x0="121.08" y0="565.73" x1="315.06" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.75; y0: 565.73; y1: 576.77; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(a) With the same project participants; </span></div><div left="121.08" right="343.77" top="543.77"><span x0="121.08" y0="543.77" x1="343.77" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.75; y0: 543.77; y1: 554.81; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(b) Registered within the previous two years; </span></div><div left="121.08" right="512.92" top="521.81"><span x0="121.08" y0="521.81" x1="512.92" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.75; y0: 521.81; y1: 532.85; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(c) Whose project boundary is within 1 km of the project boundary of the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation activity under the CDM at the closest point. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="552.48" top="486.89"><span x0="85.08" y0="486.89" x1="552.48" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 486.89; y1: 497.93; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">3.
