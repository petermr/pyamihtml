Simplified baseline and monitoring methodologies may be developed for types of small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM, as presented in the list in appendix B.  This list shall not preclude other types of small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM.  If a proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM does not fall into any of the types in appendix B, the project participants may submit a request to the Executive Board of the CDM (hereinafter referred to as the Executive Board) for approval of a proposed simplified baseline and/or monitoring plan, bearing in mind the provisions in paragraph 8 below. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="532.43" top="274.37"><span x0="85.08" y0="274.37" x1="532.43" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 274.37; y1: 285.41; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">3. The modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM shall apply to small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM except for paragraphs 12–30.
