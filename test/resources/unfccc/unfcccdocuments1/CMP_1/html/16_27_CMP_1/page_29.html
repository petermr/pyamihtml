If an average inventory parameter from a cluster of countries is used, expert review teams should follow the recommended approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I.  The inclusion in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I of drivers and approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data should be subject to guidance by lead reviewers in accordance with the provisions of appendix I.    </span></div><div left="85.08" right="549.44" top="473.57"><span x0="85.08" y0="473.57" x1="549.44" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 473.57; y1: 484.61; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">37. Expert review teams should report the reason for the use of drivers and clusters and demonstrate the appropriateness of the cluster and/or the correlation between the driver and the emissions or removals.  The use of drivers or approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data other than those recommended in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I should be explained and justified. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="535.99" top="412.73"><span x0="85.08" y0="412.73" x1="535.99" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 412.73; y1: 423.77; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">38. When using an average inventory parameter from a cluster of countries, assumptions made in choosing the cluster should be documented, as should how the given inventory average parameter compares with the default parameter or range provided in the IPCC good practice guidance or Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines, where available.  Similarly, when clustering is related to the use of a driver (application of an average driver-based emission or removal rate) from a cluster of countries, assumptions made for the composition of the cluster and the established relationship with the driver should be documented. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="174.46" top="313.01"><span x0="85.08" y0="313.01" x1="174.46" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 313.01; y1: 324.05; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">39.
