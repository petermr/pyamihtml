The inventory review resources listed in appendix I provide recommended approaches and tools for clustering inventory data.  If an adjustment has to be made for a given country, expert review teams should assign the Party in question to the cluster of countries to which it would most likely belong according to its national circumstances.    </span></div><div left="85.08" right="101.64" top="482.57"><span x0="85.08" y0="482.57" x1="101.64" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 482.57; y1: 493.61; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">50. </span><span x0="120.48" y0="482.57" x1="519.84" style="x0: 120.48; x1: 127.22; y0: 482.57; y1: 493.61; width: 6.75; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Italic;">Application of an average driver-based emission/removal rate from a cluster of countries </span><span x0="519.84" y0="482.57" x1="551.14" style="x0: 519.84; x1: 524.74; y0: 482.57; y1: 493.61; width: 4.9; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">can be used if an emission or removal estimate is missing entirely or was not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance, but data for a parameter driving the emissions or removals from that source or sink are available for the country in question.  The estimate is derived by establishing a relationship between emissions/removals and an appropriate driver for the cluster of countries with comparable national circumstances, and applying this relationship to the Party in question.

The choice of adjustment methods and application of inventory parameters relevant to the calculation of adjustments should result in conservative estimates, in that emission estimates for the base year are not overestimated, and that emission estimates for a year of the commitment period are not underestimated relative to the likely true value of the emissions of the Party concerned.  </span></div><div left="85.08" right="547.17" top="287.09"><span x0="85.08" y0="287.09" x1="547.17" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 287.09; y1: 298.13; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">52. Similarly, the choice of adjustment methods and application of inventory parameters relevant to the calculation of adjustments should result in conservative estimates, in that removal estimates for the base year are not underestimated, and that removal estimates for a year of the commitment period are not overestimated relative to the likely true value of the removals of the Party concerned. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="506.2" top="226.25"><span x0="85.08" y0="226.25" x1="506.2" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 226.25; y1: 237.29; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">53. As a principle to achieve conservative estimates, the calculation of an adjustment for a commitment period year should not result in an emission estimate that is lower or a removal estimate that is higher than that originally submitted by the Party, and an adjustment for an estimate of the base year should not result in an emission estimate that is higher or a removal estimate that is lower than the originally submitted estimate.   </span></div><div left="85.08" right="544.66" top="152.45"><span x0="85.08" y0="152.45" x1="544.66" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 152.45; y1: 163.49; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">54. To ensure conservativeness for the purpose of adjustments, a conservativeness factor should be applied to the specific component of the estimation method used by the Party or to the emission/removal estimate generated by the basic adjustment methods described in section III.A of this technical guidance.  </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="119.879" y="687.761" width="411.9599999999999" height="0.4800000000000182"/><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="208.199" y="604.961" width="235.32" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
