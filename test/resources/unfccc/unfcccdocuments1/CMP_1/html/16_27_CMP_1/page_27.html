If an adjustment is triggered by lack of transparency, and this lack of transparency precludes the expert review team from assessing possible cases of over- or underestimation or from assessing the cause of the potential deviation from the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance (such as inappropriate activity data, emission factors or methods), expert review teams should also apply the basic adjustment methods in the order of priority listed in table 1. </span></div><div left="91.32" right="361.92" top="673.85"><span x0="91.32" y0="673.85" x1="361.92" style="x0: 91.32; x1: 98.68; y0: 673.85; y1: 684.89; width: 7.36; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Bold;">Table 1.
