For the first commitment period, and subject to other provisions in this annex, the additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, shall be equal to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks, and non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012 resulting from afforestation, reforestation and deforestation under Article 3, paragraph 3, and forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, that have taken place since 1 January 1990.  Where the result of this calculation is a net sink of greenhouse gases, this value shall be added to the assigned amount of that Party.  Where the result of this calculation is a net source of greenhouse gas emissions, this value shall be subtracted from the assigned amount of that Party. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="520.56" top="622.13"><span x0="85.08" y0="622.13" x1="520.56" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 622.13; y1: 633.17; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">18. Accounting of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, shall begin with the onset of the activity or the beginning of the commitment period, whichever comes later. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="554.68" top="574.25"><span x0="85.08" y0="574.25" x1="554.68" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 574.25; y1: 585.29; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">19. Once land is accounted for under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources from, and removals by sinks on this land must be accounted for throughout subsequent and contiguous commitment periods. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="555.06" top="526.37"><span x0="85.08" y0="526.37" x1="555.06" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 526.37; y1: 537.41; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">20. National inventory systems under Article 5, paragraph 1, shall ensure that areas of land subject to land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, are identifiable, and information about these areas should be provided by each Party included in Annex I in their national inventories in accordance with Article 7.  Such information will be reviewed in accordance with Article 8.  </span></div><div left="85.08" right="530.49" top="452.57"><span x0="85.08" y0="452.57" x1="530.49" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 452.57; y1: 463.61; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">21. Each Party included in Annex I shall account for all changes in the following carbon pools:  above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, litter, dead wood, and soil organic carbon.  A Party may choose not to account for a given pool in a commitment period if transparent and verifiable information is provided that the pool is not a source. </span></div></body></html>
