If a Party has chosen not to account for a given carbon pool for an activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or an elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, an adjustment for this pool should not be applied for reasons of incompleteness as long as the Party has demonstrated, in accordance with paragraph 21 of the annex to decision 16/CMP.1, that the pool in question is not a source.  </span></div><div left="200.76" right="413.59" top="600.47"><span x0="200.76" y0="600.47" x1="413.59" style="x0: 200.76; x1: 206.22; y0: 600.47; y1: 614.51; width: 5.46; font-size: 14.04; font-family: Times-Bold;">III.

In general, expert review teams shall calculate each adjustment at the level at which the problem is identified, e.g. the IPCC category level or for the specific component in question.  If the problem is limited to only one IPCC category, only the estimate for that source or sink should be adjusted.  Similarly, if only one component of a given estimate is problematic (such as inconsistent, incorrect or misapplied emission factors or other inventory parameters, or activity data), the review team should replace only that component in calculating the adjusted estimate.  For land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) estimates, consideration should be given to the spatial disaggregation of estimates, where relevant and applicable. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="554.28" top="466.01"><span x0="85.08" y0="466.01" x1="554.28" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 466.01; y1: 477.05; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">23. If the necessary input data or parameters are not available at the IPCC category level at which the problem is identified, or the problem involves more than one component of an emission or removal estimation method used by the Party, or the complexity of the methodology used does not allow replacing only the problematic component in question, more aggregate data should be used as the basis for the adjustment.  However, expert review teams should make every effort to make the adjustment at the levels at which the problems were identified, in order to avoid making data that do not qualify for an adjustment subject to the adjustment. </span></div><div left="267.12" right="373.45" top="366.05"><span x0="267.12" y0="366.05" x1="373.45" style="x0: 267.12; x1: 275.09; y0: 366.05; y1: 377.09; width: 7.97; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Bold;">A.

In choosing the basic adjustment method and the input data that are appropriate for a specific adjustment case, expert review teams should, in general, follow the methods listed in priority order in table 1, as appropriate, unless otherwise indicated in the sector-specific elements included in chapter IV.  If the requirements for the highest priority adjustment method according to the table are not available, the next preferred adjustment method should be used.   </span></div><div left="85.08" right="525.4" top="222.65"><span x0="85.08" y0="222.65" x1="525.4" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 222.65; y1: 233.69; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">26. If a consistent time series of estimates prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance is available and no more than two yearsâ€™ estimates are missing, a simple extrapolation of this time series would be the most appropriate adjustment method.   </span></div><div left="85.08" right="88.32" top="142.87"><span x0="85.08" y0="142.87" x1="88.32" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 88.32; y0: 142.87; y1: 149.35; width: 3.24; font-size: 6.48; font-family: Times-Roman;">8</span><span x0="90.84" y0="137.56" x1="544.21" style="x0: 90.84; x1: 96.38; y0: 137.56; y1: 147.52; width: 5.54; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times-Roman;">For example, if an emission or removal estimate is missing, if the estimation method used by the Party was not in conformity with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance, or if there is a problem with more than one component (emission factor, activity data or other parameter) of the estimation method used by the Party. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="85.079" x2="229.079" y1="154.001" y2="154.001"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
