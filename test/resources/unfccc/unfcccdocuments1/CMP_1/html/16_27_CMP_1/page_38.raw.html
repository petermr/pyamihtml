This appendix provides two sets of tables of conservativeness factors to be used in the calculation of adjustments to ensure that adjusted estimates are conservative, in accordance with paragraphs 51 and 52 of the technical guidance.  The first set of tables (tables 1 and 2) covers conservativeness factors for sources included in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol.  The second set of tables (tables 3.a, 3.b, 4.a and 4.b) covers conservativeness factors for emissions and removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).  For both sets of tables, these conservativeness factors are provided in two parts:  </span></div><div left="121.08" right="523.17" top="591.53"><span x0="121.08" y0="591.53" x1="523.17" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 591.53; y1: 602.57; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(a) For Annex A sources, one for use in the calculation of adjustments for a base year estimate and one for the calculation of adjustments for a year of the commitment period   </span></div><div left="121.08" right="542.02" top="556.61"><span x0="121.08" y0="556.61" x1="542.02" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 556.61; y1: 567.65; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(b) For estimates of emissions and removals from LULUCF, separate factors are provided for emissions and removals, for use in the calculation of adjustments to the LULUCF sector during the initial review for the purpose of establishing a Party&#8217;s assigned amount (tables 3.a and 3.b), and for use in the calculation of adjustments of activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4 (tables 4.a and 4.b).   </span></div><div left="85.08" right="524.21" top="482.81"><span x0="85.08" y0="482.81" x1="524.21" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 482.81; y1: 493.85; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">2. In all tables, conservativeness factors are provided for emission factors or other estimation parameters, activity data, and emission or removal estimates for each IPCC category and Article 3, paragraph 3 and 4 activity, and corresponding gas.  </span></div><div left="85.08" right="550.06" top="434.93"><span x0="85.08" y0="434.93" x1="550.06" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 434.93; y1: 445.97; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">3. When a given category is not covered in the table, the provision of paragraph 55 of the technical guidance applies, such as for categories &#8220;other&#8221; under industrial processes, agriculture, LULUCF, waste and the IPCC sector &#8220;7 Other&#8221;.  </span></div><div left="85.08" right="553.47" top="387.05"><span x0="85.08" y0="387.05" x1="553.47" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 387.05; y1: 398.09; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">4. The conservativeness factors in these tables will be updated, as required, following the collective recommendation of lead reviewers, subject to approval by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice. </span></div><div left="103.92" right="529.8" top="339.17"><span x0="103.92" y0="339.17" x1="529.8" style="x0: 103.92; x1: 109.44; y0: 339.17; y1: 350.21; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">1.  Application of conservativeness factors to estimates from LULUCF (tables 3.a, 3.b, 4.a, 4.b) </span></div><div left="85.08" right="543.18" top="317.21"><span x0="85.08" y0="317.21" x1="543.18" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 317.21; y1: 328.25; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">5. According to paragraphs 22 and 23 of the technical guidance, adjustments should be applied at the lowest level possible at which the problem is identified.  Therefore, there might be a need to apply adjustments to individual components (e.g. emission factors, inventory parameters or activity data) as well as to estimates of carbon stock changes from individual carbon pools. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="543.6" top="256.37"><span x0="85.08" y0="256.37" x1="543.6" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 256.37; y1: 267.41; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">6. To ensure that the selection of the conservativeness factors from the tables of conservativeness factors for LULUCF contributes to a conservative adjustment in line with paragraph 53 of the guidance, the expert review team should determine whether the individual component or the carbon stock change from the individual pool subject to adjustment leads to an increase of either emissions or removals, and choose the conservativeness factor accordingly from the respective tables, taking into account the year to which the adjustment is applied (base year or year of the commitment period, as appropriate).  For any component or carbon stock change that contributes to increasing emissions, conservativeness factors should be selected from tables 3.a, 4.a or 4.b as appropriate; for any component or carbon stock change that contributes to increasing removals, conservativeness factors  should be selected from tables 3.b, 4.a or 4.b, as appropriate. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="117.719" y="339.881" width="409.32" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
