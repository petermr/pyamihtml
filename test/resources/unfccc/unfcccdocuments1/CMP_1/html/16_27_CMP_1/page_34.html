Data on populations and/or urban populations, and GDP per capita, could be used in some cases to estimate the volume of solid waste, taking into account national circumstances.  Urban population and protein consumption data could be used to obtain activity data to estimate emissions from domestic wastewater handling.  Production data associated with the main industries in a specific country could be used as a possible driver to estimate the amount of industrial wastewater, taking into account differences in technologies (e.g. emission per unit production). </span></div><div left="85.08" right="538.49" top="639.17"><span x0="85.08" y0="639.17" x1="538.49" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 639.17; y1: 650.21; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">72. For activity data, a cluster of countries based mainly on waste management practices could be used for estimating certain types of data, such as the waste generation rate, but not for estimating other types of data, such as the amount of waste incinerated or the amount of waste deposited, because these data largely depend on national environmental waste management policies. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="539.2" top="578.33"><span x0="85.08" y0="578.33" x1="539.2" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 578.33; y1: 589.37; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">73. When adjusting emissions from waste incineration, the applicability of drivers is very limited. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="546.91" top="556.37"><span x0="85.08" y0="556.37" x1="546.91" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 556.37; y1: 567.41; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">74. When adjusting emissions from solid waste disposal sites or wastewater treatment, the recovery of the methane needs to be considered.  For solid waste disposal the expert review team should also take into account that if activity data are constant or increasing and the country used the IPCC tier 1 default method, this will have resulted in a conservative emission estimate. </span></div></body></html>
