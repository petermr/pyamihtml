This decision was forwarded for adoption by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol  (COP/MOP) with a note in the annex section which specifies that these annexes will be incorporated in accordance with decision 15/CP.10, paragraph 5 (FCCC/CP/2004/10/Add.2).  Paragraph 5 of decision 15/CP.10 requests the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) to update the common reporting format tables contained in annex II to that decision and to prepare a draft decision for adoption by the COP/MOP to incorporate the updated tables in an annex to the present decision.  Such an update should be undertaken following the consideration of experiences gained in using the tables of the common reporting format contained in annex II to decision 15/CP.10 by the SBSTA at its twenty-seventh session.  The tables of the common reporting format are available in document FCCC/CP/2004/10/Add.2, pages 47–61. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="85.079" x2="229.079" y1="248.681" y2="248.681"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
