In the case that the Party has chosen to account annually for these activities and submits recalculated estimates, adjustments may be applied retroactively for the base year, provided these recalculated estimates have not yet been subject to review and the provisions of paragraph 4 above apply to these recalculated estimates. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="545.44" top="561.41"><span x0="85.08" y0="561.41" x1="545.44" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 561.41; y1: 572.45; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">14.

If the expert review team finds that an estimate submitted by a Party leads to an underestimation of emissions in the base year, or an overestimation of emissions in a year of the commitment period, the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph 54 below should not be applied, if such a calculation would result in an adjusted estimate with a value for the base year that is higher than the original estimate submitted by the Party or a value for a year of the commitment period that is lower than the original estimate.  </span></div><div left="85.08" right="521.3" top="334.97"><span x0="85.08" y0="334.97" x1="521.3" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 334.97; y1: 346.01; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">18. Similarly, if the expert review team finds that an estimate submitted by a Party leads to an underestimation of removals resulting from any activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, in a year of the commitment period, or an overestimation of removals in the base year for any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4 (cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation), the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph 54 below should not be applied if such a calculation would result in an adjusted estimate that is less conservative than the original estimate submitted by the Party.   </span></div><div left="85.08" right="525.76" top="235.25"><span x0="85.08" y0="235.25" x1="525.76" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 235.25; y1: 246.29; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">19.
