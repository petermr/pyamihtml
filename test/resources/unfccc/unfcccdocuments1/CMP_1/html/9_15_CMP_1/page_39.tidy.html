The standard electronic format (SEF) is an essential part of submission under Article 7, paragraph 1, of the Kyoto Protocol.  It is designed to facilitate reporting of Kyoto Protocol units by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) and review of Kyoto Protocol units. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="538.85" top="606.29"><span x0="85.08" y0="606.29" x1="538.85" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 606.29; y1: 617.33; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">2. Each Annex I Party shall annually report the SEF to the secretariat electronically. Any related information of a non-quantitative character shall be submitted separately.  Unless otherwise indicated, Parties shall submit information for the previous calendar year (based on Universal Time). This is referred to as the ‘reported year’ (for example, in the 2010 SEF submission, the ‘reported year’ will be the 2009 calendar year). </span></div><div left="85.08" right="547.71" top="532.49"><span x0="85.08" y0="532.49" x1="547.71" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 532.49; y1: 543.53; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">3. For each commitment period, each Annex I Party shall submit the SEF in the year following the calendar year in which the Party first transferred or acquired Kyoto Protocol units.  The first calendar year for which a Party reports this information shall in addition include any CERs that were forwarded by the clean development mechanism (CDM) registry to the registry accounts of project participants and Parties involved, under the prompt start of the CDM.  Each Annex I Party shall submit the SEF annually thereafter until the expiration of the additional period for fulfilment of commitments for that commitment period.</span><span x0="116.16" y0="460.65" x1="119.64" style="x0: 116.16; x1: 119.64; y0: 460.65; y1: 467.61; width: 3.48; font-size: 6.96; font-family: Times-Roman;">2</span></div><div left="85.08" right="496.08" top="432.77"><span x0="85.08" y0="432.77" x1="496.08" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 432.77; y1: 443.81; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">4. If an Annex I Party is undertaking transactions for two or more commitment periods simultaneously, then the Party shall provide a separate, complete report for each commitment period.

In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, not all unit types are relevant for each account or transaction type.  Where a cell is shaded in a table, the information or transaction does not apply for that particular unit type.  </span></div><div left="85.08" right="549.7" top="289.13"><span x0="85.08" y0="289.13" x1="549.7" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 289.13; y1: 300.17; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">7.

In the interest of readability, descriptive titles are used in the SEF to refer to specific account and transaction types.  Explanations of these descriptive titles and references to the pertinent provisions under the Kyoto Protocol are provided under the relevant table below.   </span></div><div left="85.08" right="88.32" top="178.15"><span x0="85.08" y0="178.15" x1="88.32" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 88.32; y0: 178.15; y1: 184.63; width: 3.24; font-size: 6.48; font-family: Times-Roman;">1</span><span x0="90.84" y0="172.84" x1="524.87" style="x0: 90.84; x1: 98.03; y0: 172.84; y1: 182.8; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times-Roman;">Assigned amount units (AAUs), emission reduction units (ERUs), removal units (RMUs), certified emission reductions (CERs), including temporary certified emission reductions (tCERs) and long-term certified emission reductions (lCERs). </span><span x0="85.08" y0="142.87" x1="88.32" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 88.32; y0: 142.87; y1: 149.35; width: 3.24; font-size: 6.48; font-family: Times-Roman;">2</span><span x0="90.84" y0="137.56" x1="552.55" style="x0: 90.84; x1: 96.38; y0: 137.56; y1: 147.52; width: 5.54; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times-Roman;">For the first commitment period, the reported years will probably be 2007–2015.
