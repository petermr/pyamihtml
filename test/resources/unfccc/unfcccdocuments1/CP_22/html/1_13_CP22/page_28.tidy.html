Key features of different channels of climate finance for developing countries are summarized in figure 2.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.92" top="715.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="715.07" x1="483.92" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 715.07; y1: 725.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">27. Mitigation-focused finance represented more than 70 per cent of the public finance in developing countries reported in 2013 and 2014. Adaptation finance provided to developing countries accounted for about 25 per cent of the total finance. This is similar to 2011&#8211;2012, although there has been a slight increase in the proportion of adaptation finance from climate funds and bilateral concessional channels. More than 80 per cent of MDB investments focused on mitigation, and less than 20 per cent on adaptation.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.93" top="637.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="637.07" x1="483.93" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 637.07; y1: 647.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">28. There has been a significant role for grants in adaptation finance. Grants represent 88 per cent of adaptation finance approved climate funds and 56 per cent of the bilateral finance reported to the OECD DAC with adaptation as a principal objective. Some least developed countries and small island developing States in Africa and Asia have been among the largest recipients of adaptation finance.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="481.98" top="571.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="571.04" x1="481.98" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 571.04; y1: 581.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">29. About 33 per cent of funding from dedicated climate funds, 42 per cent of climate-related finance in the OECD DAC and 31 per cent of climate finance reported by MDBs is for Asia, often in countries with attractive investment climates. This funding has largely supported mitigation, including REDD-plus,</span><span x0="300.29" y0="539.85" x1="303.29" style="x0: 300.29; x1: 303.29; y0: 539.85; y1: 545.85; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">7</span><span x0="308.69" y0="535.04" x1="484.18" style="x0: 308.69; x1: 312.01; y0: 535.04; y1: 545.0; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">reflecting the significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the region. About 21 per cent of finance from dedicated multilateral climate funds, 28 per cent of climate-related finance in the OECD DAC and 15 per cent of MDB climate finance is directed to African countries. There has been a growing emphasis on adaptation in this finance. About 23 per cent of funding from dedicated multilateral climate funds, 15 per cent of climate-related finance reported to the OECD DAC and 16 per cent of the climate finance reported by MDBs is directed to Latin America and the Caribbean. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.04" top="433.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="433.04" x1="484.04" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 433.04; y1: 443.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">30. There are costs associated with fund management, project development and implementation. These costs are recovered through mechanisms including administrative budgets and implementing agency fees, which vary across funds and institutions. Administrative costs range from less than 1 per cent to nearly 12 per cent of the approved funding. The actual costs are not necessarily proportional to the volumes of finance approved for projects.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.26" top="355.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="355.02" x1="484.26" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 355.02; y1: 364.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">31. A broad range of issues can present challenges in accessing climate finance, including: low levels of technical capacity to design and develop projects/programmes and to monitor and evaluate progress; difficulties in following the procedures of the funds to access finance; and low levels of awareness of the need for action and available sources of funding. Several efforts to strengthen &#8220;readiness&#8221; to access and make use of climate finance are now under way, and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) has recently stepped up its efforts in this regard. Investment in domestic capacity to structure and attract a range of sources of finance is also needed. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.0" top="252.99"><span x0="113.42" y0="252.99" x1="484.0" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 252.99; y1: 262.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">32. Ownership of climate finance and alignment of this finance with national climate change priorities and emerging policies and strategies is well recognized as an important element for ensuring effectiveness. Another important dimension is engagement of key stakeholders across government, particularly ministries of finance and planning, and across society, including civil society and the private sector. Most intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) submitted by developing country Parties outlined, in varying levels of detail, the estimated financial costs of the future emission reduction and climate </span></div><div left="104.66" right="107.66" top="151.24"><span x0="104.66" y0="151.24" x1="107.66" style="x0: 104.66; x1: 107.66; y0: 151.24; y1: 157.24; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">7</span><span x0="113.3" y0="146.64" x1="473.15" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 116.3; y0: 146.64; y1: 155.64; width: 3.0; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">In decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 70, the COP encouraged developing country Parties to contribute to mitigation actions in the forest sector by undertaking the following activities: reducing emissions from deforestation; reducing emissions from forest degradation; conservation of forest carbon stocks; sustainable management of forests; and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.  </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.1" y1="768.72" y2="768.72"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="56.64" x2="200.69" y1="161.78" y2="161.78"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
