USD 25.4 billion in 2013 and USD 26.6 billion in 2014 of climate-specific finance was reported in BRs, of which USD 23.1 billion in 2013 and USD 23.9 billion in 2014 was channelled through bilateral, regional and other channels (see figure 1).

USD 1.9 billion in 2013 and USD 2.5 billion in 2014 was channelled through the UNFCCC funds and multilateral climate funds on the basis of their financial reports.

Climate finance provided by MDBs to developing countries from their own resources was reported as USD 20.8 billion in 2013 and USD 25.7 billion in 2014. The methodology used in the 2014 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows to attribute MDB finance from developed countries to developing countries suggests that USD 11.4 billion in 2013 and USD 12.7 billion in 2014 was delivered by developed countries. A more advanced methodology, which captures better the mobilization effect through the MDBs, suggests that USD 14.9 billion in 2013 and USD 16.6 billion in 2014 can be attributed to developed countries.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="211.58" top="426.78"><span x0="113.3" y0="426.78" x1="211.58" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.39; y0: 426.78; y1: 436.74; width: 6.09; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Private climate finance  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.89" top="408.78"><span x0="113.42" y0="408.78" x1="483.89" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 408.78; y1: 418.74; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">18. The major source of uncertainty regarding flows to developing countries relates to the amount of private climate finance provided. Initial partial estimates of direct and mobilized private finance are available. Based on project-level data, renewable energy finance by developed country companies in developing countries is estimated at USD 1.8 billion in 2013 and USD 2.1 billion in 2014. Foreign direct investment in greenfield alternative and renewable energy in developing countries was estimated at USD 26.4 billion in 2013 and USD 21.6 billion in 2014. Both estimates are likely to be conservative. OECD and the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) compiled an initial partial estimate of private finance mobilized by developed countries and identified USD 12.8 billion in 2013 and USD 16.7 billion in 2014 of private co-finance. These figures include private finance mobilized from international sources in addition to private finance mobilized domestically in developing countries. These partial estimates of direct private finance and mobilized finance are distinct, and cannot simply be aggregated.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="164.93" top="240.75"><span x0="113.3" y0="240.75" x1="164.93" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 116.62; y0: 240.75; y1: 250.71; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Instruments  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.88" top="222.75"><span x0="113.42" y0="222.75" x1="483.88" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 222.75; y1: 232.71; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">19. The mix of instruments used to channel support differs by funding source (see figure 2). About 35 per cent of the bilateral, regional and other finance reported to the UNFCCC in BRs is spent as grants, 20 per cent as concessional loans, 10 per cent as non-concessional loans, and the remainder through equity and other instruments. About 38 per cent of the reported finance is channelled through multilateral institutions, many of whom are MDBs that utilize capital contributions and commitments from member countries to raise low-cost capital from other sources of funding, including for donor contributions. This enables MDBs to offer a range of instruments and financial products, including grants (9 per cent), loans, including concessional loans, (83 per cent), equity (2 per cent) and other instruments (6 per cent). About 53 per cent of funding from multilateral climate funds is provided as </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="768.72" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
