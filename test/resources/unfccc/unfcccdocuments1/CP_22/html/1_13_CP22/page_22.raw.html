The 2016 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows presents a picture of climate finance to the extent possible. Due diligence has been undertaken to utilize the best information available from the most credible sources. Challenges were nevertheless encountered in collecting, aggregating and analysing information from diverse sources. The limited clarity with regard to the use of different definitions of climate finance limits comparability of data.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.19" top="641.63"><span x0="113.42" y0="641.63" x1="484.19" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 641.63; y1: 651.59; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">6. There are uncertainties associated with each source of data, and these have different underlying causes. Uncertainties are related to the data on domestic public investments, resulting from the lack of geographic coverage and differences in the way methods are applied, significant changes in the methods for estimating energy efficiency every few years and the lack of available data on sustainable private transport and other key sectors. Uncertainties also arise from the lack of procedures and data to determine private climate finance, methods for estimating adaptation finance, differences in the assumptions of underlying formulas to attribute finance from multilateral development banks (MDBs) to developed countries, the classification of data as &#8216;green finance&#8217; and incomplete data on non-concessional flows. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.01" top="515.6"><span x0="113.42" y0="515.6" x1="484.01" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 515.6; y1: 525.56; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">7. The limitations outlined above need to be taken into consideration when deriving conclusions and policy implications from this biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows. The SCF will contribute, through its activities, to the progressive improvement of the measurement, reporting and verification of climate finance information in future biennial assessments and overviews of climate finance flows, to help address these challenges. </span></div><div left="87.5" right="184.46" top="423.94"><span x0="87.5" y0="423.94" x1="184.46" style="x0: 87.5; x1: 96.17; y0: 423.94; y1: 435.94; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">C.Key findings  </span></div><div left="95.3" right="470.82" top="400.02"><span x0="95.3" y0="400.02" x1="470.82" style="x0: 95.3; x1: 100.28; y0: 400.02; y1: 409.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">1.
