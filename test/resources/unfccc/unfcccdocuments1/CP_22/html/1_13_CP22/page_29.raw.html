In general, methodologies used to estimate financial needs or definitions of scope were not specified, and differed substantially. Beyond INDCs, few efforts to assess national or global climate finance needs have been completed since the 2014 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows. INDCs may provide a framework for strengthening ownership in the future. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.92" top="679.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="679.07" x1="483.92" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 679.07; y1: 689.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">33. Impact monitoring systems are beginning to mature, although reporting of results remains nascent and relatively slow. GHG emission accounts are a primary metric of impact and effectiveness used for climate finance mitigation, often complemented with relevant output data such as the volume of installed clean energy or reductions in energy consumption. Consistency of methodologies for GHG accounting continues to be a challenge, though progress has been made by development finance institutions, which have adopted common principles. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.94" top="589.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="589.04" x1="483.94" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 589.04; y1: 599.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">34. Most adaptation interventions seek to identify the specific number of people that are likely to benefit from the proposed interventions, either directly or indirectly in terms of increased resilience. Ensuring the accuracy of estimates can be challenging, due to difficulties in identifying beneficiaries, establishing baselines and data collection, and defining and tracking resilience over time to what may be slow onset, or 1-in-100 or 1-in-500 year events. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.09" top="511.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="511.04" x1="484.09" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 511.04; y1: 521.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">35. Many funders use co-financing as best available evidence of private finance mobilization, and many climate funds use leverage ratios as one of their key results indicators. However, co-finance does not necessarily equate to mobilization, which is often used to imply a more causal relationship between public intervention and associated private finance, which is more complex to prove. High leverage ratios may not always indicate an effective use of public finance, as ratios can also be high in interventions that are the most commercially viable. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.99" top="421.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="421.02" x1="483.99" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 421.02; y1: 430.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">36. The 2016 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows identified climate-related global climate finance flows of USD 714 billion on average in 2013&#8211;2014 (see figure 1); this is a significant amount, but is relatively small in the context of wider trends in global investment (see figure 3). For example, while investment in clean energy is rising, volumes of finance for high carbon energy in all countries remain considerably higher. Infrastructure and assets are at risk from the impacts of climate change, with serious potential consequences for the global economy.  </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="768.72" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
