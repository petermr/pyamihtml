This required a reporting architecture that was flexible enough to accommodate a diversity of reporting approaches. In some cases, limited clarity with regard to the diversity in reporting approaches limits comparability in climate finance reporting. Further improvements in reporting guidelines and formats are needed to enhance transparency on the approaches used by individual Parties and to enable greater comparability across reporting by Parties. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="352.38" top="559.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="559.04" x1="352.38" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 559.04; y1: 569.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">10.

There is a lack of systematic collection of data on climate-related private finance flows globally, due to difficulties in identifying climate-related finance, restrictions based on confidentiality, and conceptual and accounting issues. The primary sources cover mainly renewable energy and draw upon industry and sector databases, relying on voluntary disclosures. Efforts to develop methodologies for estimating mobilized private finance by public interventions are under way by the OECD DAC and the Research Collaborative on Tracking Private Climate Finance.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="481.98" top="337.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="337.02" x1="481.98" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 337.02; y1: 346.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">13.

Practices exist within the UNFCCC to review the information on support provided by Parties, including the international assessment and review of BRs and the international consultation and analysis of BURs. However, there are no internationally agreed methods for reconciling financial support provided against support received. Also, MDBs and IDFC do not have a standard procedure to review their climate finance data. In addition, BRs are not reviewed in time for aggregating data for the biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows. </span></div><div left="104.66" right="107.66" top="129.16"><span x0="104.66" y0="129.16" x1="107.66" style="x0: 104.66; x1: 107.66; y0: 129.16; y1: 135.16; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">5</span><span x0="113.3" y0="124.56" x1="181.31" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.8; y0: 124.56; y1: 133.56; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">Decision 2/CP.17. </span><span x0="104.66" y0="118.24" x1="107.66" style="x0: 104.66; x1: 107.66; y0: 118.24; y1: 124.24; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">6</span><span x0="113.3" y0="113.64" x1="181.31" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.8; y0: 113.64; y1: 122.64; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">Decision 2/CP.17. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.1" y1="768.72" y2="768.72"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="56.64" x2="200.69" y1="139.7" y2="139.7"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
