Climate finance goes to a wide range of governmental, private and non-governmental entities in recipient countries. However, reporting on recipient institutions is incomplete. For example, recipient data are available for about 50 per cent of the bilateral finance reported to the OECD DAC.

Climate finance channelled through other intermediaries may also reach national governments, but this is not captured in the data. Improving data on the recipients of climate finance could be an area for further work. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="201.62" top="576.8"><span x0="113.3" y0="576.8" x1="201.62" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 120.49; y0: 576.8; y1: 586.76; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Global finance flows  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.92" top="558.8"><span x0="113.42" y0="558.8" x1="483.92" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 558.8; y1: 568.76; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">21.

Private investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency represents the largest share of the global total; however, the energy efficiency data are much less certain than the renewable energy data. Levels of finance have increased as the costs of clean technology have continued to fall. The coverage of data in the 2016 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows has increased and improved since the 2014 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows, but nevertheless the quality and completeness of data on global total flows are lower than those for flows to developing countries. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.02" top="420.3"><span x0="113.42" y0="420.3" x1="484.02" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 420.3; y1: 430.26; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">22.

Partial data on domestic public finance expenditures of USD 192 billion per year were compiled. If these additional adjustments are included, they raise the upper end of the range to USD 880 billion in 2013 and USD 930 billion in 2014. However, the volume of the climate-related finance and investment flows globally may be higher, given that there are still significant data gaps in critical sectors such as sustainable transportation, agriculture, energy efficiency and resilient infrastructure. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.04" top="306.06"><span x0="113.42" y0="306.06" x1="484.04" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 306.06; y1: 316.02; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">23. Domestic climate finance: Comprehensive data on domestic climate expenditures are not available. Limited information is included in the BURs; estimates of climate-related finance included in national budgets, domestic climate finance provided by national development banks and commitments by developing country national climate funds. These indicative estimates suggest flows of USD 192 billion per year in developed and developing countries.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.14" top="228.03"><span x0="113.42" y0="228.03" x1="484.14" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 228.03; y1: 237.99; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">24. Some studies suggest that most climate finance in aggregate is mobilized and deployed domestically, both in developed and developing countries. In the limited number of developing countries for which information on domestic public climate finance is available, the data suggest that, in these countries, domestic public finance significantly exceeds the inflows of international public climate finance from bilateral and multilateral sources.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.98" top="150.03"><span x0="113.42" y0="150.03" x1="483.98" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 150.03; y1: 159.99; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">25.
