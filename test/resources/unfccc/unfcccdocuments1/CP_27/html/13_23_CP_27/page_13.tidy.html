Since 2017–2018, adaptation finance from bilateral channels has grown by 39 per cent (USD 2.5 billion) and from MDBs by 48 per cent (USD 6 billion), while adaptation finance from multilateral climate funds has remained constant. The share of public climate finance flows contributing to both adaptation and mitigation from multilateral climate funds rose to 35 per cent (USD 1.1 billion) in 2019–2020 from 27 per cent (USD 785 million) in 2017–2018. When assessing the balance of finance between mitigation and adaptation, it is worth considering different approaches to measuring climate finance flows and considering whether data are adjusted by the financial instrument providing the resources. Information on face-value financial volume can be complemented with information on grant-based equivalent financial volume (as is done by the GCF to assess its mitigation and adaptation split). The number of interventions and information on how different institutions allocate finance can also help inform discussions on balance. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="128.55" top="367.5"><span x0="113.3" y0="367.5" x1="128.55" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 367.5; y1: 377.46; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">21. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="367.5" x1="484.01" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 147.83; y0: 367.5; y1: 377.46; width: 6.09; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Public adaptation finance is predominantly delivered through grants while public mitigation finance predominantly takes the form of loans. </span><span x0="395.59" y0="355.5" x1="484.29" style="x0: 395.59; x1: 398.91; y0: 355.5; y1: 365.46; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">In 2019–2020, grants accounted for 57 and 99 per cent (USD 8.5 billion and USD 1.2 billion) of the face value of bilateral adaptation finance and of adaptation finance from multilateral climate funds respectively, compared with 64 and 95 per cent (USD 5.9 billion and USD 1.1 billion) respectively in 2017–2018. In 2019–2020, 15 per cent of adaptation finance flowing through the MDBs was grant-based (USD 2.1 billion) (see figure 3). Mitigation finance remains less grant-based in nature, with 31 per cent of bilateral flows (USD 4.6 billion), 30 per cent of multilateral climate fund approvals (USD 865 million) and less than 5 per cent of MDB investments (USD 1.1 billion) taking the form of grants.  </span></div><div left="104.66" right="107.66" top="60.53"><span x0="104.66" y0="60.53" x1="107.66" style="x0: 104.66; x1: 107.66; y0: 60.53; y1: 66.53; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">7</span><span x0="113.3" y0="56.88" x1="406.24" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.3; y0: 56.88; y1: 65.88; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">For more information see document FCCC/CP/2022/8−FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/7. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.1" y1="783.0" y2="783.0"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="56.64" x2="200.69" y1="71.784" y2="71.784"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
