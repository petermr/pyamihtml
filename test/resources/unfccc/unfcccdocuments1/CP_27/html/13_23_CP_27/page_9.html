An ongoing challenge is defining and reporting on outcome and impact indicators that enable the long-term or indirect effects of climate finance interventions (e.g. job creation or the increased climate resilience of beneficiaries) to be captured as opposed to measuring direct project outputs (e.g. number of beneficiaries or number of early warning systems installed). Methodologies for outcome measurement are at earlier stages of development by climate finance providers than those for output measurement.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="123.63" top="657.11"><span x0="113.3" y0="657.11" x1="123.63" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 657.11; y1: 667.07; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">8. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="657.11" x1="483.98" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 145.61; y0: 657.11; y1: 667.07; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Increasing efforts are being made to enhance the transparency and comparability of approaches for tracking consistency with low-emission and climate-resilient development pathways. </span><span x0="256.73" y0="633.11" x1="484.1" style="x0: 256.73; x1: 265.58; y0: 633.11; y1: 643.07; width: 8.85; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Methodological developments in this area, particularly from the private financial sector and supervisory authorities, are in a dynamic growth phase. The aim of these initiatives and efforts is to offer discussion of and guidance on appropriate choices of emission pathways and scenarios, emission metrics and measures, geographical and sector coverage, the role of carbon offsets, the formulation and implementation of transition plans and governance frameworks, and aggregate Paris Agreement alignment indicators. In the financial sector, a focus of current approaches on decarbonization and net zero targets, rather than on fostering climate change adaptation and resilience, continues to be observed. Since the fourth BA, initiatives that seek to increase the transparency and understanding of approaches for tracking consistency have emerged &#8211; notable among these are the United Nations High-Level Expert Group on the Net-Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities and the Expert Peer Review Group under the Race to Zero campaign. In addition, various private and public sector reports that assess approaches to alignment with the Paris Agreement continue to be published (see SCF documents on work under this area for further information).</span><span x0="210.29" y0="468.93" x1="213.29" style="x0: 210.29; x1: 213.29; y0: 468.93; y1: 474.93; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">6</span></div><div left="88.22" right="359.11" top="433.56"><span x0="88.22" y0="433.56" x1="359.11" style="x0: 88.22; x1: 96.23; y0: 433.56; y1: 445.56; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">B.

While overall investment in clean energy systems remained stable, public energy investment increased its share of total finance flows. Adaptation finance increased by 65 per cent, from an annual average of USD 30 billion in 2017&#8211;2018 to USD 49 billion in 2019&#8211;2020, driven mainly by financing from bilateral and multilateral development finance institutions.
