Mitigation finance constituted the largest share of climate-specific financial support through bilateral, regional and other channels, at 57 per cent (USD 17.9 billion). However, the share of adaptation finance continued to increase &#8211; from 20 per cent (USD 6.4 billion) in 2017&#8211;2018 to 28 per cent (USD 8.9 billion) in 2019&#8211;2020 &#8211; as it grew at a higher rate than mitigation finance. In 2019&#8211;2020, adaptation finance through bilateral, regional and other channels grew 40 per cent while mitigation finance decreased by 13 per cent. The share of cross-cutting finance, which serves both mitigation and adaptation purposes, stagnated at 14&#8211;15 per cent (USD 4.4 billion and USD 4.7 billion) in 2017&#8211;2018 and 2019&#8211;2020, respectively.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.07" top="615.11"><span x0="113.3" y0="615.11" x1="484.07" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 615.11; y1: 625.07; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">14. UNFCCC funds and multilateral climate funds approved a combined USD 2.9 billion and USD 3.5 billion for climate change projects in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The annual average for 2019&#8211;2020 (USD 3.2 billion) represents an increase of 21 per cent compared with the annual average for 2017&#8211;2018, attributable primarily to increases in project approvals by the GEF Council, the GCF Board and the Clean Technology Fund. In terms of inflows, the GEF raised USD 5.3 billion from 29 contributors under the GEF-8 replenishment in 2022 for the programming period 2022&#8211;2026, an increase of more than 30 per cent compared with the amount raised under GEF-7. Under GEF-8, USD 852 million was allocated to the climate change focal area for mitigation, an increase of 6 per cent compared with the amount allocated under GEF-7. The Adaptation Fund registered USD 356 million in new pledges from 16 donors at COP 26, which is more than triple the amount it raised in 2020 (USD 116 million).  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.16" top="465.08"><span x0="113.3" y0="465.08" x1="484.16" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 465.08; y1: 475.04; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">15. MDBs provided USD 46 billion and USD 45 billion in climate finance to developing and emerging economies in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The annual average of USD 45.9 billion in 2019&#8211;2020 represents a 17 per cent increase compared with the 2017&#8211;2018 amount. The attribution of these flows from developed to developing countries is calculated at USD 29.3&#8211;30.5 billion in 2019 and USD 28.2&#8211;33.2 billion in 2020. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.3" top="399.08"><span x0="113.3" y0="399.08" x1="484.3" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 399.08; y1: 409.04; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">16. Data on private climate finance flows to developing countries remain challenging to compile and assess. There is a methodological difference between measuring private finance for climate action in general and measuring climate finance mobilized through public interventions. With existing methodologies and approaches, tracking private finance mobilized by technical assistance or policy interventions is difficult. Further, data sources often do not specify whether private funds are sourced from private sector entities in developed or developing countries and whether these funds are received by public or private sector entities from developed or developing countries. OECD estimates that private climate finance mobilized by developed countries through bilateral and multilateral channels amounted to USD 14.4 billion and USD 13.1 billion in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The annual average of USD 13.8 billion represents a 6 per cent decrease compared with the annual average of USD 14.6 billion in 2017&#8211;2018.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.24" top="249.06"><span x0="113.3" y0="249.06" x1="484.24" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 249.06; y1: 259.02; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">17. The increase in submissions of BURs from non-Annex I Parties resulted in a greater amount of information on finance being available for the fifth BA than for previous BAs. However, time lags in data availability for reporting made it difficult to compile updated, complete information on finance received in 2019&#8211;2020. Of the 79 Parties that had submitted BURs as at 30 June 2022, 28 included some information on climate finance received in 2019 or 2020 in their reports. In total, USD 10.0 billion was reported as received for projects starting in 2019 and USD 1.6 billion for projects starting in 2020. Approximately 81 per cent of the 2019 amount was specified as coming from bilateral institutions in developed countries or multilateral institutions and 15 per cent from institutions based in developing countries; the origin of the finance was unspecified for the remaining amount.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="128.55" top="123.03"><span x0="113.3" y0="123.03" x1="128.55" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 123.03; y1: 132.99; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">18. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="123.03" x1="484.05" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 148.38; y0: 123.03; y1: 132.99; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Trends in South&#8211;South climate finance flows varied depending on the source of finance. </span><span x0="151.46" y0="111.03" x1="483.96" style="x0: 151.46; x1: 157.0; y0: 111.03; y1: 120.99; width: 5.54; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Finance commitments from International Development Finance Club members based in non-OECD countries to projects in other non-OECD countries amounted to USD 1.7 billion and USD 2.2 billion in 2019 and 2020 respectively, which represented a substantial decrease from the USD 4.1 billion committed in 2018.
