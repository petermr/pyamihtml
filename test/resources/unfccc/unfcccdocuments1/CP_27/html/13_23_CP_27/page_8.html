A total of 70 Parties have provided quantitative information on climate finance received at the project or activity level in tabular format. More Parties are reporting details on financial instruments and implementing entities and on whether finance received is for mitigation or adaptation. Information that is reported the least includes that related to the use, impacts and results of climate finance. Limited capacities and resources to track climate finance received can pose challenges for non-Annex I Parties in reporting this information, and a lack of reporting on the year an activity received climate finance can make it difficult to compile and aggregate data.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="123.63" top="579.11"><span x0="113.3" y0="579.11" x1="123.63" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 579.11; y1: 589.07; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">5. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="579.11" x1="484.39" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 147.28; y0: 579.11; y1: 589.07; width: 5.54; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Systems to track domestic public climate finance are growing in both developed and developing countries. </span><span x0="225.77" y0="567.11" x1="484.05" style="x0: 225.77; x1: 231.86; y0: 567.11; y1: 577.07; width: 6.09; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Twenty-four jurisdictions have established tracking systems for national budgets, with a further 24 countries having methodologies for tracking climate-relevant budgets in development. Building on previous work carried out as part of the climate public expenditure and institutional reviews of the United Nations Development Programme, many countries are developing guidance on green budgeting frameworks that include climate-relevant activities. Domestic public expenditures on climate change in 2019&#8211;2020 amounted to an estimated total of USD 134.2 billion (see chap. II.B below).  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="123.63" top="477.08"><span x0="113.3" y0="477.08" x1="123.63" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 477.08; y1: 487.04; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">6. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="477.08" x1="483.95" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 148.93; y0: 477.08; y1: 487.04; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Renewable energy, CCU/S, electrified transport, energy efficiency of buildings, and water management and supply are the most common mitigation activities listed across international, regional and national taxonomies or classifications</span><span x0="418.87" y0="453.08" x1="484.31" style="x0: 418.87; x1: 421.36; y0: 453.08; y1: 463.04; width: 2.49; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">. An analysis of 12 classification lists or taxonomies related to climate change mitigation activities, including those of MDBs and of regional and national jurisdictions, revealed that mitigation activities that appear most commonly (in more than 75 per cent of lists) are renewable energy, electrified transport, energy efficiency of buildings, water management and supply, and abatement technologies (e.g. carbon dioxide capture and use or storage). Different eligibility criteria are in use for common activities relating to agriculture, waste, transport infrastructure and power generation (the latter including geothermal power, hydropower, bioenergy and efficiency improvements). Less common activities (in 25&#8211;75 per cent of lists) include gas-fired power generation, waste-to-energy processes, sustainable logging, and information and communication technology infrastructure. Of the uncommon activities (less than 25 per cent of lists), notable are nuclear power generation, aviation and mining. Of the 12 taxonomies of countries and institutions reviewed, 10 make use of exclusion lists across mitigation sectors. For adaptation, most taxonomies refer to process-based screening methods rather than an activity list owing to adaptation activities being specific to a given local environment or context. The evaluation baseline for adaptation screening processes is typically based on environmental and climate risk and vulnerability assessments or national, regional or global resilience and biodiversity standards and codes. In addition, 7 of the 12 analysed taxonomies apply the &#8216;do no significant harm&#8217; principle (to other environmental objectives) when assessing the eligibility of activities. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="123.63" top="207.06"><span x0="113.3" y0="207.06" x1="123.63" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 207.06; y1: 217.02; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">7. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="207.06" x1="484.08" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 148.93; y0: 207.06; y1: 217.02; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Climate finance providers are advancing more indicators and metrics to measure what climate finance is achieving on the ground. </span><span x0="320.33" y0="195.06" x1="484.22" style="x0: 320.33; x1: 329.18; y0: 195.06; y1: 205.02; width: 8.85; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Multilateral climate funds (including the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism), multilateral institutions and national development finance institutions are in the process of developing or have already developed frameworks for measuring outputs, outcomes and impacts of climate finance interventions, with the granularity of indicators and metrics increasing.
