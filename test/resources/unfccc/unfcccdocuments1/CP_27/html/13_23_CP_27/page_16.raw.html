The number of partners through which developing countries can access multilateral climate funds continues to grow rapidly, driven by GCF accreditation. Efforts are under way to enhance access beyond national and regional entities, by supporting access at the local level.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="128.55" top="681.11"><span x0="113.3" y0="681.11" x1="128.55" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 681.11; y1: 691.07; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">27. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="681.11" x1="484.13" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 145.61; y0: 681.11; y1: 691.07; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Interest in country platforms that facilitate country ownership of climate finance flows and their alignment with national priorities is emerging. </span><span x0="386.59" y0="669.11" x1="484.22" style="x0: 386.59; x1: 393.23; y0: 669.11; y1: 679.07; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Country ownership is a fundamental factor in the delivery of effective finance but is also a broad concept encompassing active stakeholder engagement, links between climate policies and economic growth and development policies, and national spending and tracking systems for climate finance. Recent studies drawing on experience from development cooperation suggest that to be successful in stimulating climate action, country platforms need to secure and maintain political will, coordinate public finance from multiple channels and harness private investment. Also important is that country platforms are tailored to country needs and priorities. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="128.55" top="555.08"><span x0="113.3" y0="555.08" x1="128.55" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 555.08; y1: 565.04; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">28. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="555.08" x1="484.08" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 148.93; y0: 555.08; y1: 565.04; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Reported expected and actual results from climate finance providers indicate an increase in portfolio-level emission reductions and number of beneficiaries reached. </span><span x0="113.3" y0="531.08" x1="348.32" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 122.15; y0: 531.08; y1: 541.04; width: 8.85; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Multilateral climate funds reported a combined 96.3 Mt CO</span><span x0="348.55" y0="530.87" x1="351.79" style="x0: 348.55; x1: 351.79; y0: 530.87; y1: 537.35; width: 3.24; font-size: 6.48; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">2</span><span x0="353.83" y0="531.08" x1="484.28" style="x0: 353.83; x1: 358.25; y0: 531.08; y1: 541.04; width: 4.42; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">eq emission reductions achieved and 54.8 million beneficiaries reached through their interventions.

While multilateral climate funds are increasing their transparency and reporting under their results frameworks more regularly, they face persistent challenges in impact measurement, namely, that direct project output indicators are easier to define that outcome indicators and that reporting on actual results is largely dependent on the reporting capacity of implementing entities. MDBs present mitigation and adaptation outcomes to varying degrees against their results and impact frameworks, often for their entire portfolios rather than on climate-specific support, while bilateral contributors have differing approaches to impact reporting. In general, it takes at least several years before being able to report on outcomes and impacts of approved and implemented projects supported by climate finance, and this time lag poses challenges for comprehensive portfolio impact reporting.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="128.55" top="345.06"><span x0="113.3" y0="345.06" x1="128.55" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 345.06; y1: 355.02; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">29. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="345.06" x1="484.25" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 148.38; y0: 345.06; y1: 355.02; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">The way in which gender issues are addressed under the governance and operational frameworks of the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism and multilateral climate funds has improved. </span><span x0="302.09" y0="321.06" x1="484.16" style="x0: 302.09; x1: 309.28; y0: 321.06; y1: 331.02; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">However, the development of systems for monitoring and reporting on gender-related outcomes at the project and portfolio level is still in progress, as is the building of capacity of the operating entities to implement gender-responsive policies. This suggests work remains to be done on strengthening gender mainstreaming efforts and the availability of gender-disaggregated and other gender-related data to evaluate outcomes. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="128.55" top="243.06"><span x0="113.3" y0="243.06" x1="128.55" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 243.06; y1: 253.02; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">30. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="243.06" x1="484.03" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 149.49; y0: 243.06; y1: 253.02; width: 7.75; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Global climate finance flows are small relative to the overall needs of developing countries. </span><span x0="157.94" y0="231.06" x1="484.25" style="x0: 157.94; x1: 165.13; y0: 231.06; y1: 241.02; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Global climate finance in 2019&#8211;2020 was estimated to be USD 803 billion. This amount is 31&#8211;32 per cent of the annual investment needed for the global temperature rise to follow a well below 2 &#176;C or a 1.5 &#176;C pathway. This level of climate finance is also below what one would expect in the light of the investment opportunities identified and the cost of failure to meet climate stabilization targets.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.94" top="165.03"><span x0="113.3" y0="165.03" x1="483.94" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 165.03; y1: 174.99; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">31. More can be done to ensure that finance flows are consistent with climate change objectives. Such efforts include the reform of fiscal policies, financial policies and regulations and the integration and management of climate risk for financial decision-making processes by private actors and the financial sector, with care taken in all circumstances to manage a just and equitable transition for all. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.34" top="99.03"><span x0="113.3" y0="99.03" x1="484.34" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 99.03; y1: 108.99; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">32. Given the scale and speed of effort needed to align finance flows with low-emission, climate-resilient development pathways, it is critical to consider climate finance flows within the context of broader finance flows (see figure 5). A sole focus on positive climate finance flows will be insufficient to meet the overarching purpose and goals of the Paris Agreement. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="783.0" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
