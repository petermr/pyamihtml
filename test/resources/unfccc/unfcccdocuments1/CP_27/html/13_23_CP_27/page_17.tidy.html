The flows are not representative of all flows contributing to the stocks; (4) Climate finance flows are those represented in section B of the summary and recommendations and chapter 2 of the fifth BA technical report; (5) For data sources, see chapter 3 of the fifth BA technical report. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.13" top="147.75"><span x0="113.3" y0="147.75" x1="484.13" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 147.75; y1: 157.71; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">33. Across the key areas of climate finance identified through the recommendations arising from previous BAs, the findings of the fifth BA reveal both progress and continuing challenges, as presented in the table below.  </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.1" y1="783.0" y2="783.0"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
