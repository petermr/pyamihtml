It draws upon ideas contained in those documents, which have emerged over the course of negotiations on the implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. It takes account of the state of play at the conclusion today of the four informal sub-groups that I launched last Tuesday, 21 November 2000.  These results were conveyed to me by the Ministers whom I entrusted with facilitating the informal sub-groups.  I heartily thank them for their efforts to promote consensus.  They are in no way responsible for my assessment.</span></div><div left="136.65" right="493.28" top="469.24"><span x0="136.65" y0="469.24" x1="493.28" style="x0: 136.65; x1: 142.79; y0: 469.24; y1: 480.28; width: 6.14; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Italic;">This note does not address the achievements of our hard-working negotiators on Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Protocol (accounting, reporting and review).
