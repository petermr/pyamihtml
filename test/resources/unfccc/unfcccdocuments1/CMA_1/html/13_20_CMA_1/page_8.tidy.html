In the context of technology development and transfer, countries may face various challenges. Creating and enhancing enabling environments for the development and transfer of socially and environmentally sound technologies should consider the challenges faced by countries, and the different needs of the countries in overcoming such challenges. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.31" top="265.71"><span x0="113.42" y0="265.71" x1="484.31" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 265.71; y1: 275.67; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">14. Capacity-building for technology development and transfer is a cross-cutting and comprehensive issue. Although initiatives and activities on capacity-building for technology development and transfer are already being undertaken, further measures in this area are needed to develop, strengthen and enhance countries&#8217; capabilities to take effective climate action in the context of the Paris Agreement. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.19" top="199.71"><span x0="113.42" y0="199.71" x1="484.19" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 199.71; y1: 209.67; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">15.
