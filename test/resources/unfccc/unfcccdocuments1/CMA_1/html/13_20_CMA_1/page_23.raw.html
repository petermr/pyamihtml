A Party may be unable to adopt a higher tier method for a particular key category owing to lack of resources. In such cases, the Party may use a tier 1 approach, and shall clearly document why the methodological choice was not in line with the corresponding decision tree of the IPCC guidelines referred to in paragraph 20 above. The Party should prioritize for future improvement any key categories for which the good practice method elaborated in the IPCC guidelines referred to in paragraph 20 above cannot be used.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.14" top="391.74"><span x0="113.42" y0="391.74" x1="484.14" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 391.74; y1: 401.7; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">24.

Each Party shall identify key categories for the starting year and the latest reporting year referred to in chapter II.E.3 below, including and excluding land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) categories, using approach 1, for both level and trend assessment, by implementing a key category analysis consistent with the IPCC guidelines referred to in paragraph 20 above; those developing country Parties that need flexibility in the light of their capacities with respect to this provision have the flexibility to instead identify key categories using a threshold no lower than 85 per cent in place of the 95 per cent threshold defined in the IPCC guidelines referred to in paragraph 20 above, allowing a focus on improving fewer categories and prioritizing resources. </span></div><div left="99.26" right="296.78" top="205.71"><span x0="99.26" y0="205.71" x1="296.78" style="x0: 99.26; x1: 104.24; y0: 205.71; y1: 215.67; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">3.

Each Party should use surrogate data, extrapolation, interpolation and other methods consistent with splicing techniques contained in the IPCC guidelines referred to in paragraph 20 above to estimate missing emission values resulting from lack of activity data, emission factors or other parameters in order to ensure a consistent time series. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.0" top="103.69"><span x0="113.42" y0="103.69" x1="484.0" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 103.69; y1: 113.65; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0]; stroke: [0]; font-family: Times New Roman;">28. Each Party shall perform recalculations in accordance with the IPCC guidelines referred to in paragraph 20 above, ensuring that changes in emission trends are not introduced as a result of changes in methods or assumptions across the time series.  </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="782.88" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
