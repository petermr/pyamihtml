The collective commitment by developed countries is to provide new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, approaching USD 30 billion for the period 2010&#8211;2012 with balanced allocation between adaptation and mitigation. Funding for adaptation will be prioritized for the most vulnerable developing countries, such as the least developed countries, small island developing States and Africa. In the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, developed countries commit to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion dollars a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. This funding will come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance. New multilateral funding for adaptation will be delivered through effective and efficient fund arrangements, with a governance structure providing for equal representation of developed and developing countries.  A significant portion of such funding should flow through the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund.   </span></div><div left="121.09" right="503.05" top="583.24"><span x0="121.09" y0="583.24" x1="503.05" style="x0: 121.09; x1: 126.61; y0: 583.24; y1: 594.28; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: JKGBPN+TimesNewRoman;">9.To this end, a High Level Panel will be established under the guidance of and accountable to the Conference of the Parties to study the contribution of the potential sources of revenue, including alternative sources of finance, towards meeting this goal.  </span></div><div left="121.09" right="552.08" top="535.36"><span x0="121.09" y0="535.36" x1="552.08" style="x0: 121.09; x1: 126.61; y0: 535.36; y1: 546.4; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: JKGBPN+TimesNewRoman;">10.We decide that the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund shall be established as an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention to support projects, programme, policies and other activities in developing countries related to mitigation including REDD-plus, adaptation, capacity-building, technology development and transfer.  </span></div><div left="121.09" right="526.55" top="474.52"><span x0="121.09" y0="474.52" x1="526.55" style="x0: 121.09; x1: 126.61; y0: 474.52; y1: 485.56; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: JKGBPN+TimesNewRoman;">11.In order to enhance action on development and transfer of technology we decide to establish a Technology Mechanism to accelerate technology development and transfer in support of action on adaptation and mitigation that will be guided by a country-driven approach and be based on national circumstances and priorities. </span></div><div left="121.09" right="528.18" top="413.68"><span x0="121.09" y0="413.68" x1="528.18" style="x0: 121.09; x1: 126.61; y0: 413.68; y1: 424.72; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: JKGBPN+TimesNewRoman;">12.
