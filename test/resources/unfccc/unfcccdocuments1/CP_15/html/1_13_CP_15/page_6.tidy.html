Enhanced action and international cooperation on adaptation is urgently required to ensure the implementation of the Convention by enabling and supporting the implementation of adaptation actions aimed at reducing vulnerability and building resilience in developing countries, especially in those that are particularly vulnerable, especially least developed countries, small island developing States and Africa. We agree that developed countries shall provide adequate, predictable and sustainable financial resources, technology and capacity-building to support the implementation of adaptation action in developing countries.  </span></div><div left="78.59" right="491.34" top="600.17"><span x0="78.59" y0="600.17" x1="491.34" style="x0: 78.59; x1: 84.11; y0: 600.17; y1: 611.21; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: JKGBPN+TimesNewRoman;">4.Annex I Parties commit to implement individually or jointly the quantified economy-wide emissions targets for 2020, to be submitted in the format given in Appendix I by Annex I Parties to the secretariat by 31 January 2010 for compilation in an INF document. Annex I Parties that are Party to the Kyoto Protocol will thereby further strengthen the emissions reductions initiated by the Kyoto Protocol. Delivery of reductions and financing by developed countries will be measured, reported and verified in accordance with existing and any further guidelines adopted by the Conference of the Parties, and will ensure that accounting of such targets and finance is rigorous, robust and transparent.  </span></div><div left="78.6" right="489.79" top="500.44"><span x0="78.6" y0="500.44" x1="489.79" style="x0: 78.6; x1: 84.12; y0: 500.44; y1: 511.48; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: JKGBPN+TimesNewRoman;">5.Non-Annex I Parties to the Convention will implement mitigation actions, including those to be submitted to the secretariat by non-Annex I Parties in the format given in Appendix II  by  31 January 2010, for compilation in an INF document, consistent with Article 4.1 and Article 4.7 and in the context of sustainable development. Least developed countries and small island developing States may undertake actions voluntarily and on the basis of support. Mitigation actions subsequently taken and envisaged by Non-Annex I Parties, including national inventory reports, shall be communicated through national communications consistent with Article 12.1(b) every two years on the basis of guidelines to be adopted by the Conference of the Parties. Those mitigation actions in national communications or otherwise communicated to the Secretariat will be added to the list in appendix II. Mitigation actions taken by Non-Annex I Parties will be subject to their domestic measurement, reporting and verification the result of which will be reported through their national communications every two years. Non-Annex I Parties will communicate information on the implementation of their actions through National Communications, with provisions for international consultations and analysis under clearly defined guidelines that will ensure that national sovereignty is respected. Nationally appropriate mitigation actions seeking international support will be recorded in a registry along with relevant technology, finance and capacity building support. Those actions supported will be added to the list in appendix II. These supported nationally appropriate mitigation actions will be subject to international measurement, reporting and verification in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Conference of the Parties.  </span></div><div left="78.61" right="474.62" top="258.15"><span x0="78.61" y0="258.15" x1="474.62" style="x0: 78.61; x1: 84.13; y0: 258.15; y1: 269.19; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: JKGBPN+TimesNewRoman;">6.We recognize the crucial role of reducing emission from deforestation and forest degradation and the need to enhance removals of greenhouse gas emission by forests and agree on the need to provide positive incentives to such actions through the immediate establishment of a mechanism including REDD-plus, to enable the mobilization of financial resources from developed countries. </span></div><div left="78.61" right="485.12" top="197.31"><span x0="78.61" y0="197.31" x1="485.12" style="x0: 78.61; x1: 84.13; y0: 197.31; y1: 208.35; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: JKGBPN+TimesNewRoman;">7. We decide to pursue various approaches, including opportunities to use markets, to enhance the cost-effectiveness of, and to promote mitigation actions. Developing countries, especially those with low emitting economies should be provided incentives to continue to develop on a low emission pathway. </span></div><div left="78.61" right="493.85" top="136.47"><span x0="78.61" y0="136.47" x1="493.85" style="x0: 78.61; x1: 84.13; y0: 136.47; y1: 147.51; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: JKGBPN+TimesNewRoman;">8. Scaled up, new and additional, predictable and adequate funding as well as improved access shall be provided to developing countries, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, to enable and support enhanced action on mitigation, including substantial finance to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD-plus), adaptation, technology development </span></div></body></html>
