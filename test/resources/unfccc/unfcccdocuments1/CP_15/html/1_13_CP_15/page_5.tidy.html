We underline that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time.   We emphasise our strong political will to urgently combat climate change in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. To achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention to stabilize greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, we shall, recognizing the scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius, on the basis of equity and in the context of sustainable development, enhance our long-term cooperative action to combat climate change. We recognize the critical impacts of climate change and the potential impacts of response measures on countries particularly vulnerable to its adverse effects and stress the need to establish a comprehensive adaptation programme including international support. </span></div><div left="121.1" right="536.23" top="220.83"><span x0="121.1" y0="220.83" x1="536.23" style="x0: 121.1; x1: 126.62; y0: 220.83; y1: 231.87; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: JKGBPN+TimesNewRoman;">2. We agree that deep cuts in global emissions are required according to science, and as documented by the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report with a view to reduce global emissions so as to hold the increase in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius, and take action to meet this objective consistent with science and on the basis of equity. We should cooperate in achieving the peaking of global and national emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that the time frame for peaking will be longer in developing countries and bearing in mind that social and economic development and poverty </span></div><div left="85.08" right="88.32" top="125.84"><span x0="85.08" y0="125.84" x1="88.32" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 88.32; y0: 125.84; y1: 132.32; width: 3.24; font-size: 6.48; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: JKGBPN+TimesNewRoman;">1</span><span x0="96.12" y0="120.53" x1="545.24" style="x0: 96.12; x1: 101.66; y0: 120.53; y1: 130.49; width: 5.54; font-size: 9.96; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: JKGBPN+TimesNewRoman;">Some Parties listed above stated in their communications to the secretariat specific understandings on the nature of the Accord and related matters, based on which they have agreed to be listed here.
