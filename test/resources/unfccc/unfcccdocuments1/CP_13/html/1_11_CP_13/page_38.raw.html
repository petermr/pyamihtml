Observations </span></div><div left="42.48" right="510.66" top="672.06"><span x0="42.48" y0="672.06" x1="510.66" style="x0: 42.48; x1: 48.0; y0: 672.06; y1: 683.1; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0]; font-family: LCLBML+TimesNewRoman;">1.   The implementation of all elements of Article 6 of the Convention, including education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information and international cooperation, will contribute to meeting the objective of the Convention. </span></div><div left="42.47" right="504.76" top="624.18"><span x0="42.47" y0="624.18" x1="504.76" style="x0: 42.47; x1: 47.99; y0: 624.18; y1: 635.22; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0]; font-family: LCLBML+TimesNewRoman;">2.   All Parties, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities, are responsible for the implementation of Article 6 of the Convention.  The capacity to implement Article 6 activities will vary among countries, as will the priority thematic areas and target audiences, consistent with their sustainable development priorities and the culturally preferred method of programme delivery, in order to increase people(cid:146)s understanding of the climate change issue.   </span></div><div left="42.47" right="506.3" top="550.38"><span x0="42.47" y0="550.38" x1="506.3" style="x0: 42.47; x1: 47.99; y0: 550.38; y1: 561.42; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0]; font-family: LCLBML+TimesNewRoman;">3.   Regional, subregional and international cooperation can enhance the collective ability of Parties to implement the Convention, improve synergies, avoid duplication of effort between the different conventions, and ultimately both improve the effectiveness of programming and facilitate its support.  </span></div><div left="42.46" right="480.27" top="502.5"><span x0="42.46" y0="502.5" x1="480.27" style="x0: 42.46; x1: 47.98; y0: 502.5; y1: 513.54; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0]; font-family: LCLBML+TimesNewRoman;">4.   It is important to learn more from countries regarding the needs and gaps in their Article 6 activities, so that Parties and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that have the resources to do so might effectively target their efforts at providing appropriate support. </span></div><div left="42.46" right="509.17" top="454.62"><span x0="42.46" y0="454.62" x1="509.17" style="x0: 42.46; x1: 47.98; y0: 454.62; y1: 465.66; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0]; font-family: LCLBML+TimesNewRoman;">5.   Many Parties, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations, as well as the private and public sectors, are already working actively to raise awareness on, and increase understanding of, the causes and impacts of climate change, as well as solutions.  In particular, many governments are already implementing measures that could be linked to Article 6 activities.  However, the lack of adequate financial and technical resources could inhibit some Parties(cid:146) efforts to implement such activities, in particular developing country Parties. </span></div><div left="42.47" right="473.61" top="367.85"><span x0="42.47" y0="367.85" x1="473.61" style="x0: 42.47; x1: 47.99; y0: 367.85; y1: 378.89; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0]; font-family: LCLBML+TimesNewRoman;">6.   The nature of Article 6 activities carried out by Parties can easily be reported.  However, measuring or quantifying the impacts of these activities may be more challenging. </span></div><div left="200.51" right="372.75" top="332.68"><span x0="200.51" y0="332.68" x1="372.75" style="x0: 200.51; x1: 207.87; y0: 332.68; y1: 343.72; width: 7.36; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0]; font-family: Times-Bold;">B.

The present work programme sets out the scope of, and provides the basis for action on, activities related to Article 6, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.  It should serve as a flexible framework for country-driven action addressing the specific needs and circumstances of Parties, and reflecting their national priorities and initiatives. </span></div><div left="42.47" right="490.63" top="250.13"><span x0="42.47" y0="250.13" x1="490.63" style="x0: 42.47; x1: 47.99; y0: 250.13; y1: 261.17; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0]; font-family: LCLBML+TimesNewRoman;">8.   The Article 6 work programme builds on existing decisions of the Conference of the Parties, specifically the Marrakesh Accords, which contain a number of references to Article 6 activities, in particular decisions 2/CP.7 and 3/CP.7 on capacity-building in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition, 4/CP.7 on development and transfer of technologies, and 5/CP.7 on implementation of Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9.   </span></div><div left="42.47" right="305.45" top="176.33"><span x0="42.47" y0="176.33" x1="305.45" style="x0: 42.47; x1: 47.99; y0: 176.33; y1: 187.37; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; fill: [0]; font-family: LCLBML+TimesNewRoman;">9.
