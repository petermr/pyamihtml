Work developed under each key theme has evolved to a more practical and results-oriented level and should continue to do so by promoting actions in specific sectors and regions.  Therefore, there is a need to undertake periodic review on implementation of the framework and its effectiveness. </span></div><div left="42.48" right="484.85" top="652.13"><span x0="42.48" y0="652.13" x1="484.85" style="x0: 42.48; x1: 48.0; y0: 652.13; y1: 663.17; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: LCLBML+TimesNewRoman;">7. The EGTT recognized the need for financial and technical support to enable the Parties not included in the Annex I to the Convention (non-Annex I Parties) to implement the recommended actions below.
