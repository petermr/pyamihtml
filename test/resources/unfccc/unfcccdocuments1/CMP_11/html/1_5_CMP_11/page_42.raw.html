Estimates of emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector and from LULUCF activities may be based not on annual data but on extrapolations and may be recalculated at a later stage. For this reason, the application of an adjustment to the base year of cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation and wetland drainage and rewetting through an extrapolation should be done with care, given that data may not be reported for the years between the base year and the commitment period. If an extrapolation is needed for the base year of these activities, the expert review team could use as a driver the time series for the LULUCF sector included in the annual inventory submission under the Convention. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.89" top="559.16"><span x0="113.42" y0="559.16" x1="483.89" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 559.16; y1: 569.12; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">17.
