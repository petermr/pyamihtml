Some financial actors, such as MDBs and bilateral DFIs, have started to develop approaches for tracking the integration of climate change considerations into their operations. However, there was no publicly available information on the progress made on this matter at the time of preparation of the 2018 BA. Ongoing work for developing climate-resilience metrics is important for enhancing understanding of the consistency of multilateral and bilateral development finance with the Paris Agreement.  </span></div><div left="88.22" right="456.1" top="583.56"><span x0="88.22" y0="583.56" x1="456.1" style="x0: 88.22; x1: 96.23; y0: 583.56; y1: 595.56; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">B.Overview of current climate finance flows in the period 2015–2016 </span></div><div left="91.7" right="205.7" top="559.76"><span x0="91.7" y0="559.76" x1="205.7" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 559.76; y1: 569.72; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">1.

On a comparable basis, climate finance flows increased by 17 per cent in the period 2015–2016 compared with the period 2013–2014. High-bound climate finance estimates increased from USD 584 billion in 2014 to USD 680 billion in 2015 and to USD 681 billion in 2016 (see figure 1). The growth seen in 2015 was largely driven by high levels of new private investment in renewable energy, which is the largest segment of the global total. Despite decreasing technology costs (particularly in solar photovoltaic and wind power generation), which means that every dollar invested finances more renewable energy than it previously did, a significant number of new projects were financed in 2015. In 2016, a decrease in renewable energy investment occurred, which was driven by both the continued decline in renewable technology costs and the lower generation capacity of new projects financed.</span><span x0="150.26" y0="425.59" x1="153.26" style="x0: 150.26; x1: 153.26; y0: 425.59; y1: 431.59; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">7</span><span x0="156.14" y0="421.74" x1="483.9" style="x0: 156.14; x1: 163.33; y0: 421.74; y1: 431.7; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">However, the decrease in renewable energy investment in 2016 was offset by an 8 per cent increase in investment in energy efficiency technologies across the building, industry and transport sectors. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.28" top="379.74"><span x0="113.3" y0="379.74" x1="484.28" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 379.74; y1: 389.7; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">24. The quality and completeness of data on climate finance has improved since the 2016 BA. Methodological improvements in estimating finance flows have changed the comparative basis against previous estimates. In particular, 2014 estimates for energy efficiency have been revised downward owing to a more accurate bottom-up assessment model being employed by the International Energy Agency. This has resulted in a revised estimate of USD 584 billion from USD 741 billion for total global climate finance in 2014. In addition, data coverage in sustainable transport has improved, with estimates for public and private investment in electric vehicle sales in 2015 and 2016.  </span></div><div left="87.5" right="469.51" top="271.74"><span x0="87.5" y0="271.74" x1="469.51" style="x0: 87.5; x1: 90.82; y0: 271.74; y1: 281.7; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">(a) Flows from Annex II Parties to non-Annex I Parties as reported in biennial reports </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.33" top="253.71"><span x0="113.3" y0="253.71" x1="484.33" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 253.71; y1: 263.67; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">25. Climate-specific finance reported in BRs submitted by Annex II Parties has increased in terms of both volume and rate of growth since the previous BA. Whereas the total finance reported increased by just 5 per cent from 2013 to 2014, it increased by 24 per cent from 2014 to 2015 (to USD 33 billion), and subsequently by 14 per cent from 2015 to 2016 (to USD 38 billion). Out of these total amounts, USD 30 billion in 2015 and USD 34 billion in 2016 were reported as climate-specific finance channelled through bilateral, regional and other channels; the remainder flowed through multilateral channels. From 2014 to 2016, both mitigation and adaptation finance grew in more or less equal proportions, namely by 41 and 45 per cent, respectively.  </span></div><div left="87.02" right="229.94" top="133.71"><span x0="87.02" y0="133.71" x1="229.94" style="x0: 87.02; x1: 90.34; y0: 133.71; y1: 143.67; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">(b) Multilateral climate funds  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.29" top="115.71"><span x0="113.3" y0="115.71" x1="484.29" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 115.71; y1: 125.67; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">26. Total amounts channelled through UNFCCC funds and multilateral climate funds in 2015 and 2016 were USD 1.4 billion and USD 2.4 billion, respectively.
