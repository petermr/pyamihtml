The push to diversify modalities of access to climate finance continues. Institutions in beneficiary countries are increasingly able to meet fiduciary and environmental and social safeguard requirements for accessing funds. There has been a notable increase in the number of regional and national implementing entities to the multilateral climate funds, despite large amounts remaining programmed through multilateral entities. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.93" top="693.35"><span x0="113.3" y0="693.35" x1="483.93" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 693.35; y1: 703.31; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">45. Ownership remains a critical factor in the delivery of effective climate finance. A broad concept of ownership encompasses the consistency of climate finance with national priorities, the degree to which national systems are used for both spending and tracking, and the engagement of a wide range of stakeholders. There have been a number of efforts to build capacity to access and make strategic choices about how to use finance and oversee implementation. With regard to the role of governments, while there has been greater commitment by ministries of finance and planning to integrate climate finance into national budgetary planning, this is often not done fully. National-level institutions in beneficiary countries are playing a greater role in managing climate finance, particularly through domestic tracking systems. NDCs for which further financial resources need to be found are emerging as a platform that governments can use to stimulate engagement and strengthen national ownership of climate finance. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.93" top="543.32"><span x0="113.3" y0="543.32" x1="483.93" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 543.32; y1: 553.28; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">46. Mechanisms for monitoring the impact of climate finance have improved, albeit not uniformly. Thus, although the reporting of results (in terms of outputs) has increased, it is difficult to assess properly the quality of the impacts achieved (i.e. outcomes). These impacts are, moreover, presented in a multitude of formats. The reduction of GHG emissions remains the primary impact metric for climate change mitigation. Core mitigation-related multilateral funds are expected to reduce GHG emissions by over 11 billion tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (t CO</span><span x0="181.94" y0="471.11" x1="185.18" style="x0: 181.94; x1: 185.18; y0: 471.11; y1: 477.59; width: 3.24; font-size: 6.48; font-family: Times New Roman;">2</span><span x0="188.78" y0="471.32" x1="462.71" style="x0: 188.78; x1: 193.2; y0: 471.32; y1: 481.28; width: 4.42; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">eq), with reported reductions already approaching 37 million t CO</span><span x0="462.94" y0="471.11" x1="466.18" style="x0: 462.94; x1: 466.18; y0: 471.11; y1: 477.59; width: 3.24; font-size: 6.48; font-family: Times New Roman;">2</span><span x0="469.78" y0="471.32" x1="484.36" style="x0: 469.78; x1: 474.2; y0: 471.32; y1: 481.28; width: 4.42; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">eq. GHG reduction results are complemented by other quantitative data, such as the number of beneficiaries and the renewable energy capacity installed. The metrics, benchmarks and frameworks for monitoring the impact of mitigation projects continue to evolve, thereby helping to inform investment decisions. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.99" top="405.3"><span x0="113.3" y0="405.3" x1="483.99" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 405.3; y1: 415.26; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">47. Discussion on impact measurement of adaptation projects continues to be focused on the number and type of people that benefit from them, although the nature and extent of their beneficial effects are still difficult to quantify, both directly and indirectly. Adaptation finance channelled through core multilateral climate funds has so far reached over 20 million direct beneficiaries. The target for the combined number of direct and indirect beneficiaries is 290 million. Further work is necessary to develop adaptation and resilience metrics that can capture the whole spectrum of sectors receiving support and the many different approaches used, while allowing for aggregation of data and comparability between projects and funds. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.03" top="291.3"><span x0="113.3" y0="291.3" x1="484.03" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 291.3; y1: 301.26; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">48. The extent of co-financing remains important for the mobilization of private finance, but is challenged in terms of the availability of data, definitions and methods. Research suggests that multilateral climate funds can perform on a par with DFIs with regard to private co-financing ratios. The degree to which such finance can be mobilized, however, is often heavily influenced by the investment conditions in a country, which are in turn created by the policy and regulatory frameworks in place.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="465.03" top="207.27"><span x0="113.42" y0="207.27" x1="465.03" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 117.29; y0: 207.27; y1: 217.23; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Information relevant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), of the Paris Agreement: climate finance in context </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.92" top="177.27"><span x0="113.3" y0="177.27" x1="483.92" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 177.27; y1: 187.23; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">49. Climate finance continues to account for just a small proportion of overall finance flows (see figure 3); the level of climate finance is considerably below what one would expect given the investment opportunities and needs that have been identified. However, although climate finance flows must obviously be scaled up, it is also important to ensure the consistency of finance flows as a whole (and of capital stock) pursuant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), of the Paris Agreement. This does not mean that all finance flows have to achieve explicitly beneficial climate outcomes, but that they must reduce the likelihood of negative climate outcomes. Although commitments are being made to ensure that finance flows from DFIs are climate consistent, more can be done to understand public finance flows and ensure that they are all are consistent with countries&#8217; climate change and sustainable development </span></div></body></html>
