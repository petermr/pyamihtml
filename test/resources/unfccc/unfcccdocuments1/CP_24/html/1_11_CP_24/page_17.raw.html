The 2018 BA provides an updated overview of current climate finance flows over the years 2015 and 2016, along with data on trends from 2011 to 2014 collated in previous BA reports. Due diligence has been undertaken to utilize the best information available from the most credible sources. In compiling estimates, efforts have been made to avoid double counting through a focus on primary finance, which is finance for a new physical item or activity. Challenges were nevertheless encountered in collecting, aggregating and analysing information from diverse sources. The lack of clarity with regard to the use of different definitions of climate finance limits the comparability of data.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="123.63" top="588.32"><span x0="113.3" y0="588.32" x1="123.63" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 588.32; y1: 598.28; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">8. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="588.32" x1="219.38" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 148.93; y0: 588.32; y1: 598.28; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Data uncertainty. </span><span x0="219.41" y0="588.32" x1="484.1" style="x0: 219.41; x1: 225.5; y0: 588.32; y1: 598.28; width: 6.09; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">There are uncertainties associated with each source of data which have different underlying causes. Uncertainties are related to the data on domestic public investments, resulting from the lack of geographic coverage, differences in the way methods are applied, significant changes in the methods for estimating energy efficiency over the years, and the lack of available data on sustainable transport and other key sectors. Uncertainties also arise from the lack of procedures and data to determine private climate finance; methods for estimating adaptation finance; differences in the assumptions of underlying formulas to attribute finance from multilateral development banks (MDBs) to members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC), minus the Republic of Korea; the classification of data as &#8216;green finance&#8217;; and incomplete data on non-concessional flows. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="123.63" top="450.32"><span x0="113.3" y0="450.32" x1="123.63" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 450.32; y1: 460.28; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">9. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="450.32" x1="190.31" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 148.93; y0: 450.32; y1: 460.28; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Data gaps. </span><span x0="191.33" y0="450.32" x1="483.98" style="x0: 191.33; x1: 198.52; y0: 450.32; y1: 460.28; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">Gaps in the coverage of sectors and sources of climate finance remain significant, particularly with regard to private investment. Although estimates of incremental investments in energy efficiency have improved, there is still an inadequate understanding of the public and private sources of finance and the financial instruments behind those investments. For sustainable transport, efforts have been made to improve public and private investment in electric vehicles. However, information on sources and instruments for finance in public mass transit remains unreported in many countries. High-quality data on private investments in mitigation and finance in sectors such as agriculture, forests, water and waste management are particularly lacking. In particular, adaptation finance estimates are difficult to compare with mitigation finance estimates due to the former being context-specific and incremental, and more work is needed on estimating climate-resilient investments.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.95" top="312.3"><span x0="113.3" y0="312.3" x1="483.95" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 312.3; y1: 322.26; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">10. The limitations outlined in paragraphs 8 and 9 above need to be taken into consideration when deriving conclusions and policy implications from the 2018 BA. The SCF will contribute, through its activities, to the progressive improvement of the measurement, reporting and verification of climate finance information in future BAs to help address these challenges. </span></div><div left="79.34" right="99.27" top="230.99"><span x0="79.34" y0="230.99" x1="99.27" style="x0: 79.34; x1: 84.81; y0: 230.99; y1: 245.03; width: 5.46; font-size: 14.04; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">III.</span><span x0="113.42" y0="230.9" x1="140.99" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 123.0; y0: 230.9; y1: 244.94; width: 9.58; font-size: 14.04; font-family: ABCDEE+Cambria,Bold;">Key </span><span x0="141.02" y0="230.99" x1="195.74" style="x0: 141.02; x1: 145.7; y0: 230.99; y1: 245.03; width: 4.68; font-size: 14.04; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">findings  </span></div><div left="87.5" right="433.29" top="199.51"><span x0="87.5" y0="199.51" x1="433.29" style="x0: 87.5; x1: 96.17; y0: 199.51; y1: 211.51; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">A.Methodological issues relating to measurement, reporting and verification of public and private climate finance  </span></div><div left="91.7" right="280.34" top="162.27"><span x0="91.7" y0="162.27" x1="280.34" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 162.27; y1: 172.23; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">1.
