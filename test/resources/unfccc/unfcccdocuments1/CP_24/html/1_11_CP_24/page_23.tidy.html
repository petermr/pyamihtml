Across the financial sector, both the reporting of data on financial flows and stocks consistent with low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate-resilient pathways, and the integration of climate considerations into decision-making are at a nascent stage. The data sets available on bond markets are the most advanced, with regular and reliable data published based on green bond labelling and analysis of bonds that may be aligned with climate themes. Less information is available on bonds that may be inconsistent with low GHG emissions and climate-resilient pathways. Other market segments lack completeness of coverage and reporting quality across peer institutions. With regard to integrating climate change considerations into investment decision-making, some market segments such as listed corporations and institutional investors are participating in emerging reporting initiatives, including through target-setting processes, that will likely improve the availability of data over time. Other market segments such as insurance companies participate in comprehensive and regular survey reporting on climate integration into governance and risk-management processes. Other market segments, particularly in banking, insurance and financial services, lack breadth of coverage in reporting or are at an early stage of considering how to report data.  </span></div><div left="87.5" right="298.37" top="517.56"><span x0="87.5" y0="517.56" x1="298.37" style="x0: 87.5; x1: 96.17; y0: 517.56; y1: 529.56; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">C.Assessment of climate finance flows </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.09" top="493.76"><span x0="113.3" y0="493.76" x1="484.09" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 493.76; y1: 503.72; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">37. An assessment of the data underlying the overview of climate finance flows presented offers insights into crucial questions of interest in the context of the objective of the Convention and the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. Development banks, DFIs and multilateral climate funds play a vital role in helping countries to deliver on their NDCs. The key features of a subset of these different channels of public climate finance for beneficiary countries are summarized in the figure below, including the areas of support (adaptation, mitigation or cross-cutting) and the instruments used to deliver climate finance. </span></div><div left="81.74" right="117.83" top="403.74"><span x0="81.74" y0="403.74" x1="117.83" style="x0: 81.74; x1: 87.28; y0: 403.74; y1: 413.7; width: 5.54; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">Figure 2 </span><span x0="81.74" y0="391.5" x1="443.68" style="x0: 81.74; x1: 88.94; y0: 391.5; y1: 401.46; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Characteristics of international public climate finance flows in the period 2015–2016 </span></div><div left="93.5" right="110.55" top="255.84"><span x0="93.5" y0="255.84" x1="110.55" style="x0: 93.5; x1: 99.51; y0: 255.84; y1: 264.84; width: 6.0; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Note</span><span x0="110.54" y0="255.84" x1="307.46" style="x0: 110.54; x1: 113.04; y0: 255.84; y1: 264.84; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">: All values are based on approvals and commitments. </span><span x0="93.5" y0="244.8" x1="144.14" style="x0: 93.5; x1: 99.0; y0: 244.8; y1: 253.8; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Abbreviations</span><span x0="144.14" y0="244.8" x1="293.42" style="x0: 144.14; x1: 146.64; y0: 244.8; y1: 253.8; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">: MDB = multilateral development bank. </span><span x0="93.5" y0="237.4" x1="96.5" style="x0: 93.5; x1: 96.5; y0: 237.4; y1: 243.4; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: ABCDEE+Times,Italic;">a</span><span x0="98.78" y0="233.76" x1="532.36" style="x0: 98.78; x1: 101.78; y0: 233.76; y1: 242.76; width: 3.0; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">In decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 70, the Conference of the Parties encouraged developing country Parties to contribute to mitigation actions in the forest sector by undertaking the following activities: reducing emissions from deforestation; reducing emissions from forest degradation; conservation of forest carbon stocks; sustainable management of forests; and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.</span><span x0="93.5" y0="193.48" x1="96.5" style="x0: 93.5; x1: 96.5; y0: 193.48; y1: 199.48; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">b</span><span x0="98.78" y0="189.84" x1="527.14" style="x0: 98.78; x1: 101.78; y0: 189.84; y1: 198.84; width: 3.0; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Including Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme, Adaptation Fund, Bio Carbon Fund, Clean Technology Fund, Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, Forest Investment Program, Global Climate Change Alliance, Global Environment Facility Trust Fund, Green Climate Fund, Least Developed Countries Fund, Partnership for Market Readiness, Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience, Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program, Special Climate Change Fund and United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries.  </span><span x0="93.5" y0="127.48" x1="96.17" style="x0: 93.5; x1: 96.17; y0: 127.48; y1: 133.48; width: 2.66; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">c</span><span x0="98.3" y0="123.84" x1="533.65" style="x0: 98.3; x1: 104.31; y0: 123.84; y1: 132.84; width: 6.0; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Bilateral climate finance data are sourced from biennial reports from Parties included in Annex II to the Convention (that further include regional and other channels) for the annual average.
