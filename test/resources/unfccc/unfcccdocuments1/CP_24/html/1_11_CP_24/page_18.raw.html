The BR3 CTF tables submitted as at October 2018 suggest some increase in the provision of quantitative information, including information on public financial support in CTF table 7(b) and climate-related private finance in the BRs. </span></div><div left="87.02" right="232.82" top="687.35"><span x0="87.02" y0="687.35" x1="232.82" style="x0: 87.02; x1: 90.34; y0: 687.35; y1: 697.31; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">(b) International organizations </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.23" top="669.35"><span x0="113.3" y0="669.35" x1="484.23" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 669.35; y1: 679.31; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">13.

Measuring and reporting on impact is now common practice among multilateral climate funds, and there is now growing interest in this field by MDBs and the International Development Finance Club (IDFC), which are also undertaking work on methodologies for impact measuring in the light of the Paris Agreement. The ongoing efforts of MDBs to develop additional metrics that demonstrate how MDB financing supports climate-resilient development pathways are an important step in this direction.  </span></div><div left="88.1" right="405.4" top="435.32"><span x0="88.1" y0="435.32" x1="405.4" style="x0: 88.1; x1: 91.42; y0: 435.32; y1: 445.28; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">(c) Insights into reporting by Annex II Parties and non-Annex I Parties </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.01" top="417.3"><span x0="113.3" y0="417.3" x1="484.01" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 417.3; y1: 427.26; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">17. Notwithstanding the improvements in methodologies for reporting climate finance via the BR3 CTF tables 7, 7(a) and 7(b), some reporting issues persist that complicate the aggregation, comparison and analysis of the data.

This required a reporting architecture that was flexible enough to accommodate a diversity of reporting approaches.
