Information on climate finance flows among non-Annex I Parties is not systematically tracked, relying on voluntary reporting by countries through the OECD-DAC Creditor Reporting System and DFIs through IDFC that are based in countries that are not members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (non-OECD). Total estimates of such flows amounted to USD 12.2–13.9 billion in 2015 and USD 11.3–13.7 billion in 2016. This represents an increase of approximately 33 per cent on average from the 2013–2014 period, driven primarily by non-OECD member institutions of IDFC increasing finance significantly to other non-OECD members. New multilateral institutions include the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the New Development Bank. Together, they provided USD 911 million to renewable energy projects in 2016. The AIIB portion of this amount included outflows that may be attributable to OECD-DAC members that are shareholders in AIIB.  </span></div><div left="104.66" right="107.66" top="60.5"><span x0="104.66" y0="60.5" x1="107.66" style="x0: 104.66; x1: 107.66; y0: 60.5; y1: 66.5; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">8</span><span x0="113.3" y0="56.86" x1="451.03" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.8; y0: 56.86; y1: 65.86; width: 5.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">This includes Hebei Province in China, reporting an expenditure of USD 6.1 billion in 2015.  </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.1" y1="782.88" y2="782.88"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="56.64" x2="200.69" y1="72.0" y2="72.0"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
