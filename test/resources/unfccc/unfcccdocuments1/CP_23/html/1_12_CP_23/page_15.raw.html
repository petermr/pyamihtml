By decision 21/CP.22, paragraph 27, the Subsidiary Body for Implementation was requested to develop a gender action plan (GAP) in order to support the implementation of gender-related decisions and mandates in the UNFCCC process, which may include priority areas, key activities and indicators, timelines for implementation, responsible and key actors and indicative resource requirements for each activity, and to further elaborate its review and monitoring processes. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.29" top="621.35"><span x0="113.3" y0="621.35" x1="484.29" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 621.35; y1: 631.31; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">2. The GAP, created under the Lima work programme on gender, seeks to advance women&#8217;s full, equal and meaningful participation and promote gender-responsive climate policy and the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the implementation of the Convention and the work of Parties, the secretariat, United Nations entities and all stakeholders at all levels.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.09" top="555.32"><span x0="113.3" y0="555.32" x1="484.09" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 555.32; y1: 565.28; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">3. Gender-responsive climate policy requires further strengthening in all activities concerning adaptation, mitigation and related means of implementation (finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building) as well as decision-making on the implementation of climate policies. The GAP recognizes the need for women to be represented in all aspects of the UNFCCC process and the need for gender mainstreaming through all relevant targets and goals in activities under the Convention as an important contribution to increasing their effectiveness. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.36" top="465.32"><span x0="113.3" y0="465.32" x1="484.36" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 465.32; y1: 475.28; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">4. The GAP recognizes that gender-related action is being progressed across all areas of the Convention and with respect to the Paris Agreement. Many of the activities in the GAP have been the subject of action by a variety of relevant organizations and will continue to require further action beyond the time frame of the plan. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.97" top="411.3"><span x0="113.3" y0="411.3" x1="483.97" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 411.3; y1: 421.26; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">5. The activities in the GAP vary in terms of measurability, and Parties are at various stages in terms of progress on this agenda. Some actions may be afforded differing degrees of prioritization according to the nature and scale of the climate policies being implemented and the capacities of Parties. The GAP recognizes that climate action under the Convention is a Party-driven process.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="190.22" top="337.54"><span x0="113.3" y0="337.54" x1="190.22" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 120.63; y0: 337.54; y1: 349.54; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">Priority areas  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.99" top="313.74"><span x0="113.3" y0="313.74" x1="483.99" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 313.74; y1: 323.7; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">6. Parties, the secretariat and relevant organizations are invited to undertake the activities contained in the GAP, as appropriate. The GAP sets out, in five priority areas, the activities that will drive the achievement of its objectives. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="394.84" top="271.5"><span x0="113.3" y0="271.5" x1="394.84" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 120.49; y0: 271.5; y1: 281.46; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">A.
