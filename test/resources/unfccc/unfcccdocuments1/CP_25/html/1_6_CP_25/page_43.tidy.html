Figures illustrating the information referred to in paragraphs 31–34 above should be presented showing unadjusted inventory data and a ‘with measures’ projection for the period from 1990 (or another base year, as appropriate) to the most recent inventory year and for subsequent years that end in either a zero or a five, extending at least 15 years from the most recent inventory year. Additional figures may also be presented. The figure below illustrates the presentation of a hypothetical Party’s projection of emissions. It shows unadjusted inventory data for the period from 1990 to the most recent inventory year and ‘with measures’, ‘with additional measures’ and ‘without measures’ projections. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="307.24" top="657.71"><span x0="113.3" y0="657.71" x1="307.24" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 121.05; y0: 657.71; y1: 667.67; width: 7.75; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Hypothetical Party’s projection of emissions  </span></div><div left="88.22" right="399.46" top="388.9"><span x0="88.22" y0="388.9" x1="399.46" style="x0: 88.22; x1: 96.23; y0: 388.9; y1: 400.9; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">E.

The estimated and expected effects of individual policies and measures are addressed in the policies and measures section of the national communication. In the projections section of the national communication, Parties shall present the estimated and expected total effect of implemented and adopted policies and measures. Parties may also present the total expected effect of planned policies and measures.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.04" top="298.86"><span x0="113.3" y0="298.86" x1="484.04" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 298.86; y1: 308.82; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">37.

Parties may estimate the total effect of their measures by calculating the difference between a ‘with measures’ and a ‘without measures’ projection. Alternatively, Parties may use another approach, for example individually assessing the effect of each significant policy and measure and aggregating the individual effects to arrive at a total. In either case, in the reporting it should be clear from what year onward it was assumed that policies were implemented or not implemented in calculating the estimate. </span></div><div left="88.82" right="183.77" top="117.31"><span x0="88.82" y0="117.31" x1="183.77" style="x0: 88.82; x1: 96.16; y0: 117.31; y1: 129.31; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">F.
