In accordance with Article 12, paragraph 2, of the Convention, Parties shall communicate information on policies and measures adopted to implement their commitments under Article 4, paragraph 2(a) and (b), of the Convention, which need not have the limitation or reduction of GHG emissions or the enhancement of removals as a primary objective. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.96" top="591.11"><span x0="113.3" y0="591.11" x1="483.96" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 591.11; y1: 601.07; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">10. In their reporting, Parties should give priority to policies and measures, or combinations of policies and measures, that have the most significant impact on GHG emissions and removals, and they may also indicate those that are innovative and/or effectively replicable by other Parties. Parties may report on adopted policies and measures and those in the planning stage, but should clearly distinguish them from implemented policies and measures. The national communication does not have to report every policy and measure that affects GHG emissions. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.01" top="501.08"><span x0="113.3" y0="501.08" x1="484.01" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 501.08; y1: 511.04; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">11. Policies and measures reported on should be: those implemented (those for which one or more of the following applies: (1) national legislation is in force; (2) one or more voluntary agreements have been established; (3) financial resources have been allocated; and (4) human resources have been mobilized); those adopted (those for which an official government decision has been made and there is a clear commitment to proceed with implementation); and/or those planned (options under discussion or announced and with a realistic chance of being adopted and implemented in the future) by governments at the national, state, provincial, regional and local levels, as applicable. Furthermore, policies and measures reported may also include those adopted in the context of regional or international efforts. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.31" top="387.06"><span x0="113.3" y0="387.06" x1="484.31" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 387.06; y1: 397.02; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">12. Parties should report on actions taken to implement their commitments under Article 4, paragraph 2(e)(ii), of the Convention, which requires them to identify and periodically update their own policies and practices that encourage activities that lead to greater levels of anthropogenic GHG emissions than would otherwise occur. Parties should also provide the rationale for such actions in the context of their national communications. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.94" top="321.06"><span x0="113.3" y0="321.06" x1="483.94" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 321.06; y1: 331.02; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">13.

Each sector shall have its own textual description of the significant policies and measures, as set out in section D below, supplemented by table 1 below.
