Each Annex II Party shall provide information on measures taken to promote, facilitate and finance the transfer of, access to and the deployment of climate-friendly technologies for the benefit of non-Annex I Parties and for the support of the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of non-Annex I Parties.

Each Annex II Party shall provide, in textual and tabular formats (see table 10 below), information on measures and activities related to technology transfer implemented or planned since its previous national communication or biennial report. In reporting such measures and activities, Annex II Parties shall, to the extent possible, provide information on the recipient country, the targeted area of mitigation or adaptation, the sector involved and the sources of technology transfer from the public or private sectors, and shall distinguish between activities undertaken by the public and private sectors. As the ability of Parties to collect adequate information on private-sector activities is limited, Parties may indicate, where feasible, how they have encouraged private-sector activities and how those activities help Parties to meet their commitments under Article 4, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, of the Convention. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.224" y="783.0" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
