In view of the objective of the Convention and the intent to modify longer-term trends in emissions and removals, Parties should include information on historical emissions and removals on a quantitative basis for the period from 1990 (or another base year, as appropriate) to the most recent inventory year. The information should be presented for 1990 (and another base year, as appropriate), 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and subsequent years that end in either a zero or a five up to the most recent inventory year. Parties should include projections on a quantitative basis, starting from the most recent inventory year and for subsequent years that end in either a zero or a five, extending at least 15 years from the most recent inventory year (e.g. 2020, 2025, 2030 and 2035). Projections and information on historical emissions and removals should be presented in tabular format. The tabular format used shall be as in tables 2, 3 and 4 below. For Parties using a base year other than 1990 for their GHG inventories, in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 6, of the Convention, inventory data for that year shall be given.  </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.224" y="783.0" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
