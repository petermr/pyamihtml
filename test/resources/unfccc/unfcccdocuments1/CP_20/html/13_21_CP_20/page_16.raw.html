The ERT may compare the activity data of the Annex I Party with relevant authoritative sources taking into account the conclusions of the meeting of the lead reviewers for GHG inventories and agreed by the SBSTA, if feasible, and identify if there are significant differences which have not been explained by the Party. In cases where significant differences between the data sources are identified, the ERT shall provide the Annex I Party with the data used to make its assessment where it is possible to do so. Recommendations based on the outcome of the data comparison should not appear in the review report in cases where it is not possible to provide the Party with the data. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="768.72" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
