Details of the training programme</span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.2" top="617.63"><span x0="113.3" y0="617.63" x1="484.2" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 617.63; y1: 627.59; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">1. The courses are intended to train review experts for the technical review of information reported under the Convention related to greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention. All training courses will be available online. For trainees without easy access to the Internet, courses will be distributed electronically; for courses facilitated by instructors, trainees will communicate electronically with the instructor during the training period. At the request of any Party, the training courses will also be made available to other experts interested in the technical review of GHG inventories, provided that this does not require additional resources. All courses will be available upon request to trainees all year round, without facilitation by instructors. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.2" top="503.6"><span x0="113.3" y0="503.6" x1="484.2" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 503.6; y1: 513.56; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">2. A closing seminar for the basic course of the training programme will be offered annually for around 30 participants (new review experts for the technical review of GHG inventories). </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.29" top="461.6"><span x0="113.3" y0="461.6" x1="484.29" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 461.6; y1: 471.56; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">3. Additional regional training seminars for new review experts for the technical review of GHG inventories and a refresher seminar for experienced review experts for the technical review of GHG inventories may be offered annually, depending on the availability of resources. The refresher seminars may be offered in conjunction with meetings of lead reviewers, in order to enhance their knowledge and that of other experienced review experts for the technical review of GHG inventories. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.93" top="383.58"><span x0="113.3" y0="383.58" x1="483.93" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 383.58; y1: 393.54; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">4.

When participants attend a training seminar, the examination will generally take place during that seminar. In all other circumstances, other arrangements for examinations will be made, provided that the examinations take place under the supervision of the secretariat and that no additional resources are required. For courses without a training seminar, the examination will take place online. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.29" top="287.58"><span x0="113.3" y0="287.58" x1="484.29" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 287.58; y1: 297.54; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">6. New review experts for the technical review of GHG inventories who successfully complete the relevant requirements of the training programme and pass the examinations will be invited to participate in centralized or in-country reviews, working alongside experienced review experts. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.15" top="233.55"><span x0="113.3" y0="233.55" x1="484.15" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 233.55; y1: 243.51; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">7.
