The secretariat shall compare any findings from the initial assessment specific to individual Annex I Parties with findings and responses from Parties from previous reviews. For this purpose, a communication tool with findings and responses from Annex I Parties should be developed and maintained that registers findings from the initial assessment and questions from ERTs together with responses from Parties over time. The ERTs should have access to past exchanges between Annex I Parties and reviewers via this tool.   </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.24" top="591.56"><span x0="113.3" y0="591.56" x1="484.24" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 591.56; y1: 601.52; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">71.

ERTs, coordinated by the secretariat, shall conduct reviews of individual GHG inventories in order to assess whether the COP has accurate, consistent and relevant information on annual GHG inventories. The individual reviews will be conducted in accordance with paragraphs 75 and 76 below. The individual inventory review shall cover each Annex I Party&#8217;s national inventory, supplementary material submitted by the Party and, if necessary for the review of recalculations and inventory improvements, previous inventory submissions. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.18" top="441.56"><span x0="113.3" y0="441.56" x1="484.18" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 441.56; y1: 451.52; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">73. ERTs shall pay particular attention to key categories, those areas of the inventory where issues have been identified and recommendations made in previous reviews, or stages of the review, progress in the implementation of the planned improvements, or where recalculations or other changes have been reported by the Annex I Party. Focus should be given to issues that have an impact on the level and/or trend of total national GHG emissions and removals, taking into account national circumstances, as appropriate. The Party may respond to an ERT identification of an issue with information about the amount of effort and resources required for an improvement relative to the impact on the level and/or trend of total national GHG emissions or removals for consideration by the ERT. ERTs should not perform an individual review in cases where an NIR has not been provided. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="481.98" top="303.54"><span x0="113.3" y0="303.54" x1="481.98" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 303.54; y1: 313.5; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">74. In addition to the tasks mentioned in paragraph 75 below, ERTs conducting in-country reviews will consider the &#8216;paper trail&#8217; of the inventory from the collection of data to the reported emission estimates and will examine procedures and institutional arrangements for inventory development and management, including QA and QC, record-keeping and documentation procedures. During subsequent centralized reviews, the ERTs will identify any changes that may have occurred in these procedures and institutional arrangements, based on the information provided in the NIRs of Annex I Parties and further information from the Parties provided to the ERT. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="365.08" top="201.51"><span x0="113.3" y0="201.51" x1="365.08" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 201.51; y1: 211.47; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">75.
