The GCF is expected to eventually have a replenishment process, as the GEF does. The GCF will aim for an equal allocation of finance to mitigation and adaptation projects over time, and for at least 50 per cent of the adaptation finance to be allocated to particularly vulnerable countries, including the LDCs, SIDS and the African States. The Board has also decided to maximize the engagement of the private sector, including through significant allocation to the Private Sector Facility of the Fund. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="252.5" top="667.07"><span x0="113.3" y0="667.07" x1="252.5" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.94; y0: 667.07; y1: 677.03; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Conclusion and recommendations </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.93" top="649.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="649.07" x1="483.93" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 649.07; y1: 659.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">49. The financing for climate change from the GEF Trust Fund increased significantly from GEF 4 to GEF 5. While the allocation to the GEF 6 climate change focal area has slightly decreased compared with GEF 5, there are several climate-relevant components in the new integrated approaches and within the sustainable forest management set-aside. Overall, financing for climate change related interventions has continued to increase from GEF 5 to GEF 6. Moreover, the GEF Trust Fund is considered to be predictable and sustainable. Its adequacy, however, cannot be determined since the GEF is only one of the many financing channels for climate change in developing countries. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.91" top="547.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="547.04" x1="483.91" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 547.04; y1: 557.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">50. The review has found that the funds provided to the LDCF and SCCF have substantially increased over the period of the review. The needs, however, have also increased during that period and there remains a backlog of fundable projects. Financing is provided to these funds via voluntary channels and is therefore not considered predictable and sustainable. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.95" top="481.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="481.04" x1="483.95" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 481.04; y1: 491.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">51. The GEF and the GCF may consider collaborating in the use of funding pathways that may include the LDCF and the SCCF. </span></div><div left="87.5" right="272.09" top="437.4"><span x0="87.5" y0="437.4" x1="272.09" style="x0: 87.5; x1: 96.17; y0: 437.4; y1: 449.4; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">D.Delivery of financial resources </span></div><div left="91.7" right="209.06" top="413.58"><span x0="91.7" y0="413.58" x1="209.06" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 413.58; y1: 423.54; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">1.

The GEF delivers financing to recipient countries&#8217; governments, to NGOs and to the private sector. This is guided by a country allocation for the different focal areas of the GEF Trust Fund. There is no allocation system for the LDCF and the SCCF. However, the GEF has established a ceiling for the LDCF in order to prevent countries with strong institutional capacity in preparing projects from depleting the limited resources of the LDCF, to the disadvantage of the other LDCs. The GEF has also established a process for direct access to the GEF Trust Fund for enabling activities, but only a few countries have applied such direct access. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.94" top="293.58"><span x0="113.42" y0="293.58" x1="483.94" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 293.58; y1: 303.54; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">53. The allocation parameters and procedures of the GEF and its agencies, as well as the capacity of countries to formulate and develop proposals, affect developing countries&#8217; access to the GEF. To further assist countries, the GEF secretariat is working to directly engage countries and increase their awareness and understanding of policies and procedures of the GEF. This is done through national dialogues and other such mechanisms. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.02" top="227.55"><span x0="113.42" y0="227.55" x1="484.02" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 227.55; y1: 237.51; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">54. During GEF 5, all developing countries including LDCs and SIDS were able to programme their STAR allocation. Estimates of the overall utilization of STAR allocations by developing countries show an uptake of 93 per cent for the overall GEF Trust Fund, with 80 and 85 per cent of utilization by LDCs and SIDS, respectively. While some of the barriers to accessing the GEF Fund were solved with STAR, co-financing remains an obstacle to access, especially for the LDCs and SIDS. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.05" top="149.55"><span x0="113.42" y0="149.55" x1="484.05" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 149.55; y1: 159.51; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">55. The GEF Council in 2010 decided to accredit up to 10 new GEF project agencies, at least half of them based in developing countries, in order to expand the range of agencies with which GEF recipient countries could work.
