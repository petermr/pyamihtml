In order to expedite the project cycle during GEF 6, the GEF should ensure that its co-financing policy is clearly understood and appropriately applied by accredited GEF project agencies and GEF implementing agencies. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="337.24" top="625.07"><span x0="91.7" y0="625.07" x1="337.24" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 625.07; y1: 635.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">3. Adequacy, predictability and sustainability of funds </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.95" top="607.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="607.07" x1="483.95" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 607.07; y1: 617.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">43. With a replenishment process taking place every four years, funding to the GEF Trust Fund is provided in a predictable and sustainable manner by developed countries. As no assessment of the financing needs of developing countries has been agreed on at the level of the Convention, it is challenging to assess the adequacy of the financing provided to the GEF. Furthermore, since GEF is only a channel through which financial support is provided to developing countries, an assessment of the adequacy of resources mobilized for developing countries that looks only at the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism will be misleading because of its narrow scope. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.95" top="505.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="505.04" x1="483.95" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 505.04; y1: 515.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">44. Through the application of its System for Transparent Allocation of Resources (STAR), the GEF has made the funding for its recipient countries, especially SIDS and LDCs, fairly predictable. The midterm evaluation undertaken by the GEF Independent Evaluation Office highlighted that STAR has contributed to making GEF operations more relevant to country needs and priorities and has led to greater transparency in GEF operations. As a result, high levels of utilization of STAR allocations were experienced during GEF 5 by all GEF recipients, with an 85 and 80 per cent utilization of overall STAR allocations by SIDS and the LDCs, respectively. Moreover, the GEF 6 policy recommendation on updating STAR stipulates measures to increase the funding allocations for the LDCs. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.01" top="379.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="379.02" x1="484.01" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 379.02; y1: 388.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">45. Although the LDCF has seen considerable growth over recent years, additional contributions are needed if the Fund is to meet the full costs of addressing the urgent and immediate adaptation needs of the LDCs. For example, as at September 2014, no resources were available for new funding approvals under the LDCF, whereas resources amounting to USD 41.8 million were sought for five full-sized projects that had been technically cleared by the GEF secretariat. For the next GEF cycle (2014&#8211;2018), the GEF has estimated the financing needs of the LDCF at USD 700&#8211;900 million. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.01" top="289.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="289.02" x1="484.01" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 289.02; y1: 298.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">46. Despite a successful record both in terms of positive evaluations and accelerated approval and disbursement rates, the main obstacle to adaptation programming under the SCCF remains the lack of adequate and predictable resources. Given the continued high demand for resources from the SCCF, the GEF has reported that, for example during the fiscal year 2014, the SCCF could meet less than 30 per cent of the demand reported in the priority project documents submitted to the GEF secretariat for technical review and in the relevant work programme entry. The GEF has estimated the financing needs of the SCCF for 2014&#8211;2018 at USD 400&#8211;500 million. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.14" top="186.99"><span x0="113.42" y0="186.99" x1="484.14" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 186.99; y1: 196.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">47. STAR does not apply to LDCF and SCCF funding. However, the LDCF applies a principle of 'equitable access&#8221; to ensure that funding is available to all LDCs. This principle includes a ceiling intended to prevent countries with strong institutional capacity in preparing projects from depleting the limited resources of the LDCF, to the disadvantage of other LDCs. In April 2014, the ceiling was increased from USD 20 million to USD 30 million in response to the significant, additional contributions received between June and December 2013. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="768.72" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
