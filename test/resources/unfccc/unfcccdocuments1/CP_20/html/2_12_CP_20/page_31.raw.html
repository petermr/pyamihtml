There is ample room for the GCF to learn from the experiences of other funds in terms of improving the enabling environments in recipient countries. It can do this by linking investments with focused efforts to engage stakeholders within countries in programming, and by providing technical assistance and capacity-building so as to strengthen enabling environments &#8211; institutions, policies, and regulations &#8211; that support mitigation and adaptation actions in developing countries. </span></div><div left="88.22" right="219.17" top="653.43"><span x0="88.22" y0="653.43" x1="219.17" style="x0: 88.22; x1: 96.23; y0: 653.43; y1: 665.43; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">E.Results and impacts </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.37" top="629.63"><span x0="113.42" y0="629.63" x1="484.37" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 629.63; y1: 639.59; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">70. In an effort to assess the impacts of its activities, the GEF has created a results-based management (RBM) framework and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) requirements. The fifth overall performance study, however, has reported that the RBM framework and M&amp;E requirements of the GEF are too onerous to be executed and had recommended that the RBM framework of GEF 6 include a limited number of outcomes that can be measured through existing or easily generated data.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.92" top="551.6"><span x0="113.42" y0="551.6" x1="483.92" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 551.6; y1: 561.56; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">71.

The fifth overall performance study of the GEF found that as at 30 June 2013, the GEF had allocated a total of USD 3.3 billion to 615 projects that address climate change mitigation, of which USD 3.1 billion has been allocated to 547 projects with mitigation targets. The total amount of direct and indirect mitigation impact expected from these projects is 2.6 and 8.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO</span><span x0="415.27" y0="436.79" x1="418.51" style="x0: 415.27; x1: 418.51; y0: 436.79; y1: 443.27; width: 3.24; font-size: 6.48; font-family: Times New Roman;">2</span><span x0="422.83" y0="437.6" x1="484.29" style="x0: 422.83; x1: 427.25; y0: 437.6; y1: 447.56; width: 4.42; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">eq) emissions, respectively, or 10.8 billion tonnes of CO</span><span x0="279.53" y0="424.77" x1="282.77" style="x0: 279.53; x1: 282.77; y0: 424.77; y1: 431.25; width: 3.24; font-size: 6.48; font-family: Times New Roman;">2</span><span x0="285.29" y0="425.58" x1="344.2" style="x0: 285.29; x1: 289.71; y0: 425.58; y1: 435.54; width: 4.42; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">eq combined.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.17" top="407.58"><span x0="113.42" y0="407.58" x1="484.17" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 407.58; y1: 417.54; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">73. Despite improving the methodologies for the measurement of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, evaluations by the GEF of mitigation impact stress the difficulties of consistent reporting. The key underpinning parameters are dynamic, and this may result in substantial changes to realized GHG emission reductions. Similarly, assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions is difficult. The GEF has initiated a work programme in order to improve its methodologies and systems for measuring GHG reductions more consistently. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="195.14" top="311.58"><span x0="91.7" y0="311.58" x1="195.14" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 311.58; y1: 321.54; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">2.

Over the years, the adaptation programme of the GEF (the GEF Trust Fund, the LDCF and the SCCF) has supported focused efforts to help developing countries to adapt to and strengthen their resilience to the impacts of climate change. As at 26 September 2014, a total of 79 LDCF projects provided an estimate of the expected number of direct beneficiaries. These projects, with LDCF resources amounting to USD 386.31 million, seek to reduce the vulnerability of an estimated 8.1 million people directly. Forty-nine LDCF projects support 35 countries in their efforts to integrate climate change adaptation into 112 national development policies, plans and frameworks. The LDCF also assists countries in laying the groundwork for climate-resilient development planning through 51 projects that will enable 34 countries to strengthen their national hydro-meteorological and climate information services. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.91" top="155.55"><span x0="113.42" y0="155.55" x1="483.91" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 155.55; y1: 165.51; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">75. Under the SCCF, 32 projects provided an estimated number of direct beneficiaries as at 26 September 2014. These projects, to which SCCF resources amounting to USD 135.72 million have been allocated, aim to reduce the vulnerability of an estimated 3.54 million people directly. In addition, 19 SCCF projects are already supporting 34 countries </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="768.72" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
