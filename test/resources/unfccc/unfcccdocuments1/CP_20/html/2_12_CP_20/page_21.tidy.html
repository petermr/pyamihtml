Interviews with the stakeholders of the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism were also undertaken in order to generate further information.

As there was a time limitation, it was not possible to expand the research beyond the available literature and conduct surveys on an appropriate sample of recipient countries in order to complement the areas where updated information was not available. Such an approach, however, could be undertaken in preparing for the sixth review of the Financial Mechanism. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.07" top="352.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="352.02" x1="484.07" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 352.02; y1: 361.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">3.
