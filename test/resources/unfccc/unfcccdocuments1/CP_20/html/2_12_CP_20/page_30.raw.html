Additionally, countries are now also supported to undertake an NPFE to engage across governments and relevant stakeholders on how GEF resources should best be used and prioritized. In the majority of cases, the NPFE provided a helpful framework for interaction between the GEF and stakeholders, but its uptake during GEF 5 was relatively low. Participants to the GEF-6 replenishment process encouraged recipient countries to undertake NPFEs as early as possible so as to facilitate the programming of GEF 6 country allocations. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.87" top="643.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="643.07" x1="483.87" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 643.07; y1: 653.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">63. The concept of country ownership has been a driving principle in the design of the GCF. It is also a key element of the GCF investment framework approved in May 2014. Coherence with national policies and strategies and engagement with national stakeholders will be key considerations in fostering country ownership in the actions of the GCF. A transparent no-objection procedure is to be developed to this end. Through early investments in readiness, the GCF secretariat is beginning the process of engagement with countries in order to understand their priorities. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="185.27" top="553.04"><span x0="113.3" y0="553.04" x1="185.27" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.39; y0: 553.04; y1: 563.0; width: 6.09; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Recommendation </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.95" top="535.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="535.04" x1="483.95" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 535.04; y1: 545.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">64. There is a recognized need to continue to deepen engagement at different levels of the GEF partnership as a means of fostering ownership of projects and programmes in recipient countries. Upfront support in facilitating national stakeholder engagement on how best to use country allocations has proven to be useful when done through NPFEs. Developing countries should continue to undertake NPFEs in order to facilitate the programming of their GEF 6 STAR allocations. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="300.62" top="451.04"><span x0="91.7" y0="451.04" x1="300.62" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 451.04; y1: 461.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">4. Sustainability of programmes and projects  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.96" top="433.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="433.04" x1="483.96" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 433.04; y1: 443.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">65. The GEF defines sustainability as the maintenance of the benefits of the project and programs beyond the life of the GEF intervention. In this regard, the review found that 70 per cent of GEF projects have been rated moderately satisfactory or higher in terms of their sustainability. Financial and institutional risks, as well as staff turnover and changes in government priorities have been highlighted as potential impediments to sustainability. Mainstreaming of the activities of the projects has been found to be best practice. However, mainstreaming normally requires time that goes well beyond the life of the project. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="163.91" top="343.02"><span x0="113.3" y0="343.02" x1="163.91" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.94; y0: 343.02; y1: 352.98; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Conclusion  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.19" top="325.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="325.02" x1="484.19" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 325.02; y1: 334.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">66. Policy and legislative changes as well as mainstreaming have been found to promote sustainability, but cannot always be fully implemented within the lifetime of the project. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="215.66" top="289.02"><span x0="91.7" y0="289.02" x1="215.66" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 289.02; y1: 298.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">5. Enabling environments </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.98" top="271.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="271.02" x1="483.98" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 271.02; y1: 280.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">67. A significant share of GEF 5 programmes have sought to strengthen policy and regulatory environments in order to support low-emission and climate-resilient development. In this regard, a recent evaluation of GEF support for mitigation documented causal links between support and key policy changes in a third of the projects that it reviewed. It emphasized the importance of public sector institutions, strategies and policies for the private sector replication of the approaches piloted. It found that enabling programmes that engaged key non-governmental stakeholders (including the private sector) that could be advocates for policy change were more successful. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.96" top="168.99"><span x0="113.42" y0="168.99" x1="483.96" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 168.99; y1: 178.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">68. Country-driven GEF projects that aim to develop and enact key policy changes may improve the enabling environment in recipient countries. However, it should be noted that strengthening policy and regulatory environments may require more time than a single GEF project cycle. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="161.39" top="114.99"><span x0="113.3" y0="114.99" x1="161.39" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.94; y0: 114.99; y1: 124.95; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Conclusion </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="768.72" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
