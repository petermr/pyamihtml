Moreover in April 2014, donors pledged USD 4.43 billion to the GEF for GEF 6 (July 2014 to June 2018). </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.9" top="715.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="715.07" x1="483.9" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 715.07; y1: 725.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">35. With the complete programming of the USD 50 million allocation for the strategic priority on adaptation under the GEF Trust Fund, funding in support of adaptation at the GEF is now delivered directly through the LDCF and the SCCF. As at 30 June 2014, about USD 1.3 billion overall has been programmed by the GEF for adaptation. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.08" top="661.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="661.07" x1="484.08" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 661.07; y1: 671.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">36. The LDCF and the SCCF rely on voluntary contributions from developed countries and have experienced increasing trends in contributions. Cumulative pledges to the LDCF went from USD 292 million in October 2010 to about USD 900 million in June 2014 (96 per cent has been disbursed by developed countries), while cumulative pledges to the SCCF went from USD 167 million in October 2010 to about USD 344 million in June 2014 (94 per cent has been disbursed by developed countries). </span></div><div left="113.42" right="328.58" top="583.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="583.04" x1="328.58" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 583.04; y1: 593.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">37.

Although no numerical figure or target was defined for this initial resource mobilization, it was agreed that it would be commensurate with the ambition of the Fund to promote the paradigm shift towards low-emission and climate-resilient development pathways in developing countries. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="161.39" top="493.04"><span x0="113.3" y0="493.04" x1="161.39" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.94; y0: 493.04; y1: 503.0; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Conclusion </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.96" top="475.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="475.04" x1="483.96" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 475.04; y1: 485.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">38. The GEF has mobilized resources via a replenishment process (GEF Trust Fund) and voluntary channels for the LDCF and the SCCF. Additional resources are mobilized by co-financing for GEF funds. Through the aforementioned resources, combined, the GEF has raised considerable funds for climate change. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="370.12" top="415.02"><span x0="91.7" y0="415.02" x1="370.12" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 415.02; y1: 424.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">2.

From the estimates of co-financing ratios achieved by the GEF, climate change has attained the highest co-financing ratios. As a result, climate change constitutes about 50 per cent of the total co-financing mobilized by the GEF. However, caution should be exercised when looking at these ratios, as they mask a high variability in these ratios at the project level, and the flexibility accorded by the GEF to least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS), from which a higher level of co-financing is not necessarily requested during the approval process. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.33" top="307.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="307.02" x1="484.33" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 307.02; y1: 316.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">40. National governments have been the main source of co-financing (equivalent to about 41 per cent of the fourth replenishment of the GEF (GEF 4) and GEF 5 co-financing that has been mobilized), followed by the GEF agencies as the second highest provider of co-financing (about 25 per cent of GEF 4 and GEF 5 total co-financing), the private sector and bilateral, multilateral sources, foundations or NGOs. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="481.98" top="240.99"><span x0="113.42" y0="240.99" x1="481.98" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 240.99; y1: 250.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">41. Two main issues have been raised within the GEF partnership with regards to co-financing. The first is the lack of clarity in the definition and application of co-financing by the GEF. The second is that the process for seeking co-financing can delay the project cycle significantly.
