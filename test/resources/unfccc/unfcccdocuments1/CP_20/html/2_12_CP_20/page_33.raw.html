Decision 11/CP.1, paragraph 2(a), provides that &#8220;consistency should be sought and maintained between the activities (including those related to funding) relevant to climate change undertaken outside the framework of the financial mechanism and the policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria for activities as relevant, established by the Conference of the Parties&#8221;. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.37" top="550.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="550.04" x1="484.37" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 550.04; y1: 560.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">84. In terms of activities funded outside the framework of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, the clean development mechanism (CDM) has been a successful incentive to implement mitigation action in developing countries. By the end of 2013, over 7,400 CDM projects had been registered in 93 developing countries, representing an estimated investment in excess of USD 400 billion and amounting to 1.46 billion certified emission reductions issued (or a reduction of 1.46 billion tonnes of CO</span><span x0="359.23" y0="489.23" x1="362.47" style="x0: 359.23; x1: 362.47; y0: 489.23; y1: 495.71; width: 3.24; font-size: 6.48; font-family: Times New Roman;">2</span><span x0="364.99" y0="490.04" x1="382.72" style="x0: 364.99; x1: 369.41; y0: 490.04; y1: 500.0; width: 4.42; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">eq). </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.18" top="472.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="472.04" x1="484.18" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 472.04; y1: 482.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">85. Additionally, the Clean Technology Fund (of the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs)), currently the largest multilateral mitigation fund with a cumulative capitalization of USD 5.5 billion, has been providing grants and concessional loans to developing countries.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.15" top="430.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="430.02" x1="484.15" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 430.02; y1: 439.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">86. While the Adaptation Fund (AF) has been an important vehicle in providing support for adaptation in developing countries. It was established to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries, and since its inception has allocated USD 232 million of grants to 40 developing countries. The AF has also pioneered direct access with the accreditation of national implementing entities (NIEs) in developing countries which can directly access the Fund without having to go through intermediaries. To date, 17 NIEs have been accredited to the AF.  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.89" top="340.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="340.02" x1="483.89" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 340.02; y1: 349.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">87. Another channel that has supported adaptation in developing countries is the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR) of the CIFs. The PPCR funds technical assistance and investments in order to support countries&#8217; efforts to integrate climate risk and resilience into core development planning and implementation. With total pledges amounting to USD 1.3 billion, the PPCR provides incentives for scaled-up action and initiates transformational change by catalysing a shift from &#8216;business as usual&#8217; to broad-based strategies for achieving climate resilience at the national level. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.89" top="249.99"><span x0="113.42" y0="249.99" x1="483.89" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 249.99; y1: 259.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">88. In terms of ensuring complementarity with the other financial flows and sources of investment, the GEF has reported that it continues to work collaboratively with other organizations on financing complementary activities. For example, synergies have been highlighted between the Clean Technology Fund and the GEF climate change focal area, as well as between the pilot programme on climate resilience and the LDCF and the SCCF. Furthermore, the GEF and the AF have been working collaboratively in order to enhance synergies and avoid duplication of their respective actions in developing countries. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.3" top="159.99"><span x0="113.42" y0="159.99" x1="484.3" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 159.99; y1: 169.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">89. With the establishment of the GCF, the risk of overlap among the activities financed within and outside the Convention is high. Although duplication is not desirable, it may not be the most important issue at this time, since, as outlined in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, much more significant climate financing is needed than that provided at present </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="768.72" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
