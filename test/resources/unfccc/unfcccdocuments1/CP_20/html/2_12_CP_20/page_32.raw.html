The GEF and the GCF may consider collaborating to harmonize impact indicators and set new norms around reporting practice, especially in the context of adaptation finance. Furthermore, the operationalization of the GCF results-based management framework presents an opportunity to make progress in this regard. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="202.34" top="637.07"><span x0="91.7" y0="637.07" x1="202.34" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 637.07; y1: 647.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">3.

During GEF 5, the GEF promoted technology transfer at various stages of the technology development cycle, from demonstration of innovative emerging low-emission and climate-resilient technologies to diffusion of commercially proven environmentally sound technologies and practices. Moreover, support for technology transfer has also been delivered in the context of the Poznan strategic programme on technology transfer for which a funding window of USD 50 million was created at the GEF with funds from both the GEF Trust Fund and the SCCF. The GEF has also supported the operationalization of the Climate Technology Centre and Network. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="193.22" top="511.04"><span x0="91.7" y0="511.04" x1="193.22" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 511.04; y1: 521.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">4.

The GEF has made significant investments in capacity-building, including through cross-cutting capacity-building projects as well as through capacity gained in the design and implementation of projects. Investments of the GEF covered most of the priority areas listed in the framework for capacity-building in developing countries. Furthermore, capacity-building replication and scaling up, and climate change mainstreaming into national development planning are becoming increasingly common practice within the GEF. For example, several GEF small grant projects developed into medium- and full-sized projects. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="254.18" top="391.02"><span x0="113.3" y0="391.02" x1="254.18" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.94; y0: 391.02; y1: 400.98; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Conclusion on results and impacts </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.98" top="373.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="373.02" x1="483.98" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 373.02; y1: 382.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">79. There is evidence that good results and impacts have been achieved with the resources provided by the GEF. Efforts to harmonize and improve the methodologies for measuring the results and impacts of the supported activities need to continue.  </span></div><div left="88.82" right="448.4" top="317.38"><span x0="88.82" y0="317.38" x1="448.4" style="x0: 88.82; x1: 96.16; y0: 317.38; y1: 329.38; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">F.Consistency of the Financial Mechanism with the objective of the Convention </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.98" top="280.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="280.02" x1="483.98" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 280.02; y1: 289.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">80. Article 2 of the Convention stipulates that the ultimate objective of this Convention and any legal instrument adopted by the Convention is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner. Furthermore, in accordance with decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 4, the long-term goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature below 2 &#176;C above pre-industrial levels was recognized. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.95" top="165.99"><span x0="113.42" y0="165.99" x1="483.95" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 165.99; y1: 175.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">81. The review found that as an operating entity of the Financial Mechanism, the GEF, through its projects and programmes, contributes to supporting developing countries in meeting the objective of the Convention, while enhancing their resilience to the adverse effects of climate change. In relation to the below 2 &#176;C goal, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has noted that emission patterns that limit temperature increase </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="768.72" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
