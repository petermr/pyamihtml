The Evaluation Office of the GEF has found that the GEF is highly responsive to COP guidance, and that it has taken considerable steps to report to the COP in this regard. The GEF is encouraged to continue to provide information on how it has responded to the guidance it has received via its report to the COP. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.22" top="631.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="631.07" x1="484.22" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 631.07; y1: 641.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">29. As the GCF is under development, it is too early to assess the level of its responsiveness to COP guidance. However, the efforts made by the GCF Board to respond to COP guidance can be acknowledged. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="367.36" top="583.04"><span x0="91.7" y0="583.04" x1="367.36" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 583.04; y1: 593.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">2.

The GEF has been making considerable efforts over the past 10 years to improve the efficiency of its project cycle. Full size projects (FSPs) approved during the first replenishment period of the GEF took an average of 36 months to progress through the project preparation cycle. This already lengthy preparation time increased to 50 months for projects during the second replenishment period of the GEF, and to 66 months for projects during the third replenishment period of the GEF. However, during GEF 5, the average time for preparation of GEF project cycle dropped to 18.5 months, as the GEF Council established a standard time frame of 18 months for project preparation. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.84" top="463.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="463.04" x1="483.84" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 463.04; y1: 473.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">31. Since 2012, the GEF has undertaken a series of measures that seek to improve the efficiency of its project cycle, including a pilot project for the harmonization of the GEF and World Bank project cycles. The policy recommendation of the sixth replenishment period of the GEF (GEF 6) on improving the efficiency of the GEF project cycle requested the GEF secretariat to continue to review the performance of the GEF against the current time frame standard of 18 months from GEF Council approval and endorsement by the Chief Executive Officer of the GEF to identify: (i) more effective measures with which to expedite project preparation; and (ii) an appropriate standard project cycle time frame for the GEF 6. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.96" top="349.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="349.02" x1="483.96" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 349.02; y1: 358.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">32. Consequently, the GEF secretariat will prepare, for consideration by the GEF Council at its meeting in October 2014, a set of further measures to improve the policies and procedures associated with the full project cycle, including the programmatic approach and a proposal for a policy on the cancellation of projects that exceed time frame targets for project preparation as requested by the GEF Council at its November 2013 meeting. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="163.91" top="283.02"><span x0="113.3" y0="283.02" x1="163.91" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.94; y0: 283.02; y1: 292.98; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Conclusion  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.98" top="264.99"><span x0="113.42" y0="264.99" x1="483.98" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 264.99; y1: 274.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">33. It is recognized that the GEF has undertaken measures to improve the length and efficiency of its project cycle over the years. These measures have resulted in significant improvements and the GEF is encouraged to continue undertaking such measures. </span></div><div left="87.5" right="294.05" top="209.35"><span x0="87.5" y0="209.35" x1="294.05" style="x0: 87.5; x1: 96.17; y0: 209.35; y1: 221.35; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">C.Mobilization of financial resources </span></div><div left="91.7" right="347.08" top="185.55"><span x0="91.7" y0="185.55" x1="347.08" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 185.55; y1: 195.51; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">1.

The GEF Trust Fund has been the primary source of grants provided to developing countries though the Financial Mechanism. Funding for climate change mitigation by the GEF has increased steadily from the GEF pilot phase to GEF 5. As at June 2014, the GEF has funded 787 projects on climate change mitigation amounting to more than USD 4.5 billion. Specifically, during GEF 5, about USD 1.2 billion of GEF funding was </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.1" y1="768.72" y2="768.72"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
