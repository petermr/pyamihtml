This process has moved slower than expected and the GEF is reviewing its strategy in the light of the findings of the report on the fifth overall performance study of the GEF. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.93" top="679.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="679.07" x1="483.93" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 679.07; y1: 689.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">56. The GCF will allow direct access to it by national institutions based in developing countries. The GCF readiness program is intended to foster a better direct engagement between it and its recipient countries. It will provide technical and capacity-building support for implementing entities (particularly national and subnational institutions) that may not meet the standards of the Fund yet. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="248.54" top="613.07"><span x0="113.3" y0="613.07" x1="248.54" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.94; y0: 613.07; y1: 623.03; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Conclusion and recommendation </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.89" top="595.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="595.07" x1="483.89" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 595.07; y1: 605.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">57. The GEF has made a significant effort to inform countries of the programmes and policies of the GEF, and as a result, recipient countries have utilized most of their allocations. Nevertheless, the LDCs and SIDS still face challenges in accessing all of their resources. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.93" top="541.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="541.04" x1="483.93" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 541.04; y1: 551.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">58. The GCF would benefit from lessons learned on the accreditation process from other funds, particularly the GEF. In the case of the GEF, the goal of accreditation of 10 project agencies was only partially achieved. The GCF may consider building on existing systems of GEF intermediaries and implementing entities, and may in the process also consider providing financial assistance to support the accreditation of national entities in recipient countries that may need it. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="212.66" top="457.04"><span x0="91.7" y0="457.04" x1="212.66" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 457.04; y1: 467.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">2.

The speed and efficiency of disbursement appears to be improving at the GEF, despite some challenges. While the number of projects delayed by more than two years is substantially reduced compared with GEF 4 levels, information on the amount of funding that has actually been disbursed by GEF agencies to recipient countries has not been made available in an integrated form owing to a lack of reliability of data, which is due to a lack of standard definitions of when &#8220;disbursement&#8221; takes place from GEF agencies to recipient countries. Countries have identified slow disbursements as a reason for project delays. The GEF is currently working on harmonizing the timeline for the disbursement of funds and setting performance targets. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.95" top="325.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="325.02" x1="483.95" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 325.02; y1: 334.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">60. There has been significant emphasis on disbursement in the LDCF and the SCCF. In the case of the former, the May 2014 annual monitoring report finds that active projects amounted to USD 134.98 million as at 30 June 2013, of which USD 46.49 million had been disbursed, representing an average disbursement rate of 38 per cent. The SCCF had committed USD 94.29 million to 21 projects by 30 June 2013, of which USD 33.22 million or 32 per cent had been disbursed. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="163.91" top="246.99"><span x0="113.3" y0="246.99" x1="163.91" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.94; y0: 246.99; y1: 256.95; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Conclusion  </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.06" top="228.99"><span x0="113.42" y0="228.99" x1="484.06" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 228.99; y1: 238.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">61. There is a recognized need to strengthen GEF project monitoring systems in order to be able to provide better information on the level of disbursement of approved funds. The GEF should work with its agencies on establishing a standard definition of &#8220;disbursement&#8221; in order to generate a common understanding of the term within the GEF partnership and enhance transparency of its processes. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="322.36" top="156.99"><span x0="91.7" y0="156.99" x1="322.36" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 156.99; y1: 166.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">3.

Efforts were made to strengthen the country ownership of GEF programmes and projects during GEF 5. In this regard, the midterm reviews of the experiences with STAR suggest that the clarity that countries now have on the scale and scope of their GEF </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="768.72" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
