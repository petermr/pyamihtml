While it was found that there is transparency at the level of the GEF Assembly and the GEF Council, Transparency International indicated that there remains room for improvement with regard to transparency in information disclosure by GEF agencies to GEF stakeholders. Furthermore, the fourth overall performance study of the GEF</span><span x0="458.5" y0="683.88" x1="461.5" style="x0: 458.5; x1: 461.5; y0: 683.88; y1: 689.88; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">4</span><span x0="465.94" y0="679.07" x1="484.39" style="x0: 465.94; x1: 470.36; y0: 679.07; y1: 689.03; width: 4.42; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">also highlighted a lack of transparency at the identification phase of GEF projects. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.17" top="649.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="649.07" x1="484.17" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 649.07; y1: 659.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">6. Owing to the fact that the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) follow the policies, procedures and governance structure of the GEF, their stakeholders experience similar challenges to the GEF regarding transparency and accountability at the level of project implementation. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.93" top="595.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="595.07" x1="483.93" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 595.07; y1: 605.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">7. The governance structure of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) follows a constituency model, with an established board composed of an equal number of members from developed and developing countries. The GCF Board is independent, accountable to the COP and aims to promote transparent decision-making. The Board members are selected by their respective constituency or by a regional group within their constituency. The GCF Board meetings are not webcast but they are recorded, and the recordings are made available online</span><span x0="179.18" y0="527.85" x1="182.18" style="x0: 179.18; x1: 182.18; y0: 527.85; y1: 533.85; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">5</span><span x0="186.86" y0="523.04" x1="484.05" style="x0: 186.86; x1: 189.63; y0: 523.04; y1: 533.0; width: 2.77; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">three weeks after the meeting for registered users, while the meeting documents are made publicly available online</span><span x0="297.05" y0="515.85" x1="300.05" style="x0: 297.05; x1: 300.05; y0: 515.85; y1: 521.85; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">6</span><span x0="302.57" y0="511.04" x1="441.16" style="x0: 302.57; x1: 307.55; y0: 511.04; y1: 521.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">before each meeting of the Board. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="165.23" top="493.04"><span x0="113.3" y0="493.04" x1="165.23" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.94; y0: 493.04; y1: 503.0; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Conclusions </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.3" top="475.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="475.04" x1="484.3" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 475.04; y1: 485.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">8. Based on the review by Transparency International, there is evidence that the decision-making process at the GEF is transparent. The operations and interactions of the implementing agencies of the GEF with the recipient countries during project implementation could benefit from further transparency of information disclosure on the status of implementation of the projects. This transparency is particularly critical in those recipient countries where project implementation capacity is weak. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.31" top="397.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="397.02" x1="484.31" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 397.02; y1: 406.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">9. With respect to the transparency at the project preparation phase, the review found that the national portfolio formulation exercises (NPFEs) promoted by the GEF during the fifth replenishment period of the GEF (GEF 5) has helped to improve the transparency of project preparation. Recipient countries are therefore encouraged to continue to undertake the NPFEs in order to facilitate the identification of projects. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="257.42" top="325.02"><span x0="91.7" y0="325.02" x1="257.42" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 325.02; y1: 334.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">2. Level of stakeholder involvement </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.96" top="307.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="307.02" x1="483.96" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 307.02; y1: 316.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">10. The GEF has fostered a high level of participation from civil society organizations (CSOs), and the private sector. The GEF Civil Society Organization Network, which comprises all accredited CSOs to the GEF, takes part in the GEF process from upstream policy development to project implementation at both national and local levels. The GEF Council meetings are preceded by a meeting of the GEF Civil Society Organization Network, and in addition, two CSO representatives participate in GEF Council meetings as observers and are invited to make interventions during those meetings. The GEF is currently reviewing the Policy on Public Involvement in GEF projects, in consultation with the GEF Civil Society Organization Network, in order to formulate draft guidelines for public involvement to be presented to the GEF Council in October 2014. </span></div><div left="104.66" right="107.66" top="151.24"><span x0="104.66" y0="151.24" x1="107.66" style="x0: 104.66; x1: 107.66; y0: 151.24; y1: 157.24; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">3</span><span x0="115.58" y0="146.64" x1="290.18" style="x0: 115.58; x1: 120.66; y0: 146.64; y1: 155.64; width: 5.08; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">&lt;http://www.thegef.org/gef/council_meetings&gt;. </span><span x0="104.66" y0="140.2" x1="107.66" style="x0: 104.66; x1: 107.66; y0: 140.2; y1: 146.2; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">4</span><span x0="113.3" y0="135.6" x1="293.66" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.8; y0: 135.6; y1: 144.6; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">Available at &lt;http://www.thegef.org/gef/OPS4&gt;.  </span><span x0="104.66" y0="129.16" x1="107.66" style="x0: 104.66; x1: 107.66; y0: 129.16; y1: 135.16; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">5</span><span x0="113.3" y0="124.56" x1="266.42" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.38; y0: 124.56; y1: 133.56; width: 5.08; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">&lt;http://www.gcfund.org/meetings.html&gt;.  </span><span x0="104.66" y0="118.24" x1="107.66" style="x0: 104.66; x1: 107.66; y0: 118.24; y1: 124.24; width: 3.0; font-size: 6.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">6</span><span x0="113.3" y0="113.64" x1="192.86" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.8; y0: 113.64; y1: 122.64; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: Times New Roman;">As footnote 5 above.  </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.1" y1="768.72" y2="768.72"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="56.64" x2="200.69" y1="161.78" y2="161.78"></ns0:line></ns0:g></body></html>
