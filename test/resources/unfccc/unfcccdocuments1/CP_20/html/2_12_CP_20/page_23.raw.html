The Governing Instrument of the GCF mandates the GCF Board to make arrangements, including developing and operating accreditation processes, to allow for effective participation by accredited observers in its meetings and to invite, to participate as active observers, two civil society representatives: one each from developing and developed countries, and two private sector representatives, one each from developing and developed countries. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.95" top="667.07"><span x0="113.42" y0="667.07" x1="483.95" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 667.07; y1: 677.03; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">12. The GCF Board adopted additional rules of procedure for the Board relating to observers and an accreditation process for observers to the Fund was put in place. To date, 183 organizations including CSOs, private sector organizations and international entities have been accredited as observers to GCF Board meetings. Furthermore, all four accredited active observers from civil society and the private sector participate in GCF Board meetings and are invited to make interventions. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="248.54" top="589.04"><span x0="113.3" y0="589.04" x1="248.54" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.94; y0: 589.04; y1: 599.0; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Conclusion and recommendation </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.93" top="571.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="571.04" x1="483.93" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 571.04; y1: 581.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">13. The GEF has been successful in ensuring stakeholder involvement both at the level of the GEF Council and in project implementation. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.99" top="541.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="541.04" x1="483.99" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 541.04; y1: 551.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">14. The GCF could build on the experience of and lessons learned from the GEF in terms of stakeholder involvement. In this regard, the GCF may consider establishing a robust consultative process with its observers in order to ensure that adequate and timely consultation is undertaken with respect to the development of its policies, procedures, guidelines, and, later on, during the implementation of programmes and projects of the Fund. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="238.94" top="457.04"><span x0="91.7" y0="457.04" x1="238.94" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 457.04; y1: 467.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">3.

The sub-study on gender mainstreaming made in the context of the fifth overall performance study of the GEF found that the GEF secretariat had made significant efforts to implement a gender mainstreaming policy, while there was scope for improvement in the application of the policy by GEF agencies. In addition, the policy recommendation of the sixth replenishment period of the GEF on further work on gender mainstreaming emphasized that more concerted efforts need to be made in order to enhance gender mainstreaming within the GEF. Accordingly, the GEF secretariat is currently developing a Gender Action Plan, which will identify ways to enhance gender mainstreaming, including the use of relevant gender-sensitive indicators and sex-disaggregated data. The Action Plan will be presented to the GEF Council in October 2014. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.36" top="313.02"><span x0="113.42" y0="313.02" x1="484.36" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 313.02; y1: 322.98; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">16. In the light of the provisions of its governing instrument to take a Fund-wide &#8220;gender-sensitive approach&#8221;, the GCF has committed to integrating gender considerations in its procedures and operational modalities. At its seventh meeting, the GCF Board approved an initial results management framework with provisions for sex-disaggregated indicators, including initial criteria for assessing programmes and projects proposals that include gender aspects. The GCF secretariat is currently preparing a draft gender action policy and action plan for consideration by the Board at its meeting in October 2014. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="248.54" top="222.99"><span x0="113.3" y0="222.99" x1="248.54" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 119.94; y0: 222.99; y1: 232.95; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Italic;">Conclusion and recommendation </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.92" top="204.99"><span x0="113.42" y0="204.99" x1="483.92" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 204.99; y1: 214.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">17. The GEF has made considerable progress in mainstreaming gender into its activities. Since there is scope for improvement, an action plan is to be approved by the GEF Council in October 2014 and the results of this progress are expected to be reflected in the programmes and projects of the GEF. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="484.2" top="150.99"><span x0="113.42" y0="150.99" x1="484.2" style="x0: 113.42; x1: 118.4; y0: 150.99; y1: 160.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">18. In developing its own approach to gender mainstreaming, the GCF could build on the experience of the GEF. It is recommended that gender equality be integrated in the structure and organization of the GCF itself, and that gender-sensitive criteria be taken into account in funding approvals of the Fund. </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="55.2" y="768.72" width="484.90000000000003" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
