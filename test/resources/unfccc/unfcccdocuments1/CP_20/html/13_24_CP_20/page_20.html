The technical review of BRs is the first step of the international assessment and review (IAR) process. The overall objectives of the IAR process are to review the progress made by developed country Parties in achieving emission reductions and to assess the provision of financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing country Parties, as well as to assess emissions and removals related to quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets under the SBI, taking into account national circumstances, in a rigorous, robust and transparent manner, with a view to promoting comparability and building confidence. In addition, the IAR process aims at assessing the implementation of methodological and reporting requirements. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="485.11" top="499.04"><span x0="113.3" y0="499.04" x1="485.11" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 499.04; y1: 509.0; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">100.
