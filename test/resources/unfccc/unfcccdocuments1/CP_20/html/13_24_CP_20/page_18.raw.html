All main issues which are identified by the ERT in relation to requirements in the UNFCCC Annex I inventory reporting guidelines, including any issues described in paragraph 83 above, should be summarized by the ERT in the list of provisional main findings. The provisional main findings shall be communicated to the Annex I Party at the end of the week in which the individual review is performed. The Party may provide further clarifications related to the provisional main findings within two weeks.

The secretariat will complete the initial assessment containing the elements in paragraph 69 above. The secretariat will incorporate all submissions and any resubmissions from Annex I Parties that were provided as a response to the status report and were received within six weeks from the due date for submissions. Annex I Parties should provide comments within three weeks of receipt of the draft assessment report. The secretariat will send a draft of the assessment report to the Annex I Party at the latest seven weeks prior to the scheduled individual review, and the Party will provide comments within three weeks.

Any information, corrections, additional information or comments on the draft status report received from the Annex I Party within six weeks of the submission due date shall be subject to the initial assessment.

The secretariat should forward all relevant information to the members of the ERTs one month prior to the start of the review of the individual annual inventories. The ERT shall examine the information and raise questions for clarification to Annex I Parties under review, if necessary, two weeks prior to the start of the review.

To achieve consistent review reports and a comparable treatment of Annex I Parties in the review process, the secretariat shall implement QA procedures. The QA procedures developed by the secretariat should be presented to and discussed at the meeting of the lead reviewers for GHG inventories. The purpose of the QA procedures is to ensure a consistent identification and treatment of issues. Editorial streamlining should take place only to the extent that the timelines for publication of the review reports are not compromised. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.89" top="210.99"><span x0="113.3" y0="210.99" x1="483.89" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 210.99; y1: 220.95; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">90.
