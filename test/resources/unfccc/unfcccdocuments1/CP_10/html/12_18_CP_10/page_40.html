Debundling is defined as the fragmentation of a large project activity into smaller parts.  A small-scale project activity that is part of a large project activity is not eligible to use the simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism (CDM).  A large project activity or any of its components shall follow the regular modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="535.87" top="610.01"><span x0="85.08" y0="610.01" x1="535.87" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 610.01; y1: 621.05; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">2. A proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM shall be deemed to be a debundled component of a large project activity if there is a registered small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM or an application to register another afforestation or reforestation small-scale project activity under the CDM: </span></div><div left="121.08" right="311.93" top="549.17"><span x0="121.08" y0="549.17" x1="311.93" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 549.17; y1: 560.21; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(a) With the same project participants </span></div><div left="121.08" right="340.64" top="527.21"><span x0="121.08" y0="527.21" x1="340.64" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 527.21; y1: 538.25; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(b) Registered within the previous two years </span></div><div left="121.08" right="515.6" top="505.25"><span x0="121.08" y0="505.25" x1="515.6" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 505.25; y1: 516.29; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(c) Whose project boundary is within 1 km of the project boundary of the proposed  small-scale afforestation or reforestation activity under the CDM at the closest point. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="553.0" top="470.33"><span x0="85.08" y0="470.33" x1="553.0" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 470.33; y1: 481.37; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">3. If a proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM is deemed to be a debundled component in accordance with paragraph 2 above, but the total size of such an activity combined with the previously registered small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM does not exceed the limits for small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activities under the CDM as set out in paragraph 1 (i) of the annex to decision 19/CP.9, the project activity can qualify to use simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM. </span></div></body></html>
