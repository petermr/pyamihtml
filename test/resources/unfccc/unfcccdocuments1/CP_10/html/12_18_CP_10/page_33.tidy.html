The registration by the Executive Board shall be deemed final four weeks after the date of receipt by the Executive Board of the request for registration, unless a Party involved in the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM, or at least three members of the Executive Board, request a review of the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM.  The review by the Executive Board shall be made in accordance with the following provisions:  </span></div><div left="121.08" right="471.55" top="661.01"><span x0="121.08" y0="661.01" x1="471.55" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 661.01; y1: 672.05; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(a) It shall be related to issues associated with the validation requirements </span></div><div left="121.08" right="549.88" top="639.05"><span x0="121.08" y0="639.05" x1="549.88" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 639.05; y1: 650.09; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(b) It shall be finalized no later than at the second meeting following the request for review, with the decision and the reasons for it being communicated to the project participants and the public. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="545.46" top="591.17"><span x0="85.08" y0="591.17" x1="545.46" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 591.17; y1: 602.21; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">17. A proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM that is not accepted may be reconsidered for validation and subsequent registration after appropriate revisions, provided that this project activity follows the procedures and meets the requirements for validation and registration, including those relating to public comments. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="538.85" top="530.33"><span x0="85.08" y0="530.33" x1="538.85" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 530.33; y1: 541.37; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">18. A small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM is additional if the actual net greenhouse gas removals by sinks are increased above the sum of the changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the project boundary that would have occurred in the absence of the registered small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="542.94" top="469.49"><span x0="85.08" y0="469.49" x1="542.94" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 469.49; y1: 480.53; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">19. The baseline for a proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM is the scenario that reasonably represents the sum of the changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the project boundary that would have occurred in the absence of the proposed project activity.  A baseline shall be deemed to reasonably represent the sum of the changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the project boundary that would occur in the absence of the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM if it is derived using a baseline methodology referred to in appendix B.   </span></div><div left="85.08" right="549.84" top="369.77"><span x0="85.08" y0="369.77" x1="549.84" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 369.77; y1: 380.81; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">20. A simplified baseline and monitoring methodology listed in appendix B may be used for a small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM if the project participants are able to demonstrate to a DOE that the project activity would otherwise not be implemented due to the existence of one or more of the barriers listed in attachment A to appendix B.  Where specified in appendix B for a project type, quantitative evidence that the project activity would otherwise not be implemented may be provided instead of a demonstration based on the barriers listed in attachment A to appendix B.   </span></div><div left="85.08" right="524.76" top="283.01"><span x0="85.08" y0="283.01" x1="524.76" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 283.01; y1: 294.05; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">21. The crediting period shall begin at the start of the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM.  The crediting period for a proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM shall be either of the following: </span></div><div left="121.08" right="534.68" top="235.13"><span x0="121.08" y0="235.13" x1="534.68" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 235.13; y1: 246.17; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(a) A maximum of 20 years which may be renewed at most two times, provided that, for each renewal, a DOE determines and informs the Executive Board that the original project baseline is still valid or has been updated taking account of new data where applicable </span></div><div left="121.08" right="269.35" top="174.29"><span x0="121.08" y0="174.29" x1="269.35" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 174.29; y1: 185.33; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(b) A maximum of 30 years. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="545.9" top="152.33"><span x0="85.08" y0="152.33" x1="545.9" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 152.33; y1: 163.37; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">22. A small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM shall be designed in such a manner as to minimize leakage. </span></div></body></html>
