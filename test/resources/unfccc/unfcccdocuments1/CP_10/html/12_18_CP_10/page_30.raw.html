Project participants willing to submit a new type of small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM or revisions to a methodology shall make a request in writing to the Executive Board providing information about the activity and proposals on how a simplified baseline and monitoring methodology would be applied to this type.  The Board may draw on expertise, as appropriate, in considering new project types and/or revisions of and amendments to simplified methodologies.  The Executive Board shall expeditiously, if possible at its next meeting, review the proposed methodology.

Several small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activities under the CDM may be bundled for the purpose of validation.  An overall monitoring plan that monitors performance of the constituent project activities on a sample basis may be proposed for bundled project activities.
