The purpose of this appendix is to outline the information required in the project design document for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism (CDM).  A project activity shall be described in detail in a project design document, taking into account the provisions for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM as set out in the present annex, in particular in its section C on validation and registration and in its section D on monitoring.  The description shall include the following:  </span></div><div left="121.08" right="544.09" top="583.97"><span x0="121.08" y0="583.97" x1="544.09" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 583.97; y1: 595.01; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(a) A description of the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM comprising the project purpose; a technical description of the project activity, including species and varieties selected and how technology and know-how will be transferred, if appropriate; a description of the physical location and boundaries of the project activity; and a specification of the gases whose emissions will be part of the project activity </span></div><div left="121.08" right="552.13" top="497.21"><span x0="121.08" y0="497.21" x1="552.13" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 497.21; y1: 508.25; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(b) A description of the present environmental conditions of the area including a description of climate, hydrology, soils, ecosystems, and the possible presence of rare or endangered species and their habitats </span></div><div left="121.08" right="535.96" top="449.33"><span x0="121.08" y0="449.33" x1="535.96" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 449.33; y1: 460.37; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(c) A description of legal title to the land, rights of access to the sequestered carbon, and current land tenure and land use </span></div><div left="121.08" right="543.91" top="414.41"><span x0="121.08" y0="414.41" x1="543.91" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 414.41; y1: 425.45; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(d) Carbon pools selected, as well as transparent and verifiable information, in accordance with paragraph 21 of the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM </span></div><div left="121.08" right="543.68" top="366.53"><span x0="121.08" y0="366.53" x1="543.68" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 366.53; y1: 377.57; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(e) A statement of which baseline and monitoring methodologies in appendix B have been selected </span></div><div left="121.08" right="550.66" top="331.61"><span x0="121.08" y0="331.61" x1="550.66" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 331.61; y1: 342.65; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(f) A description of how the simplified baseline methodology in appendix B will be applied in the context of the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity </span></div><div left="121.08" right="483.76" top="296.69"><span x0="121.08" y0="296.69" x1="483.76" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 296.69; y1: 307.73; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(g) Measures to be implemented to minimize potential leakage, as applicable </span></div><div left="121.08" right="526.71" top="274.73"><span x0="121.08" y0="274.73" x1="526.71" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 274.73; y1: 285.77; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(h) The start date for the project activity, with justification, and the choice of crediting periods during which the project activity is expected to result in net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks </span></div><div left="121.08" right="509.57" top="226.85"><span x0="121.08" y0="226.85" x1="509.57" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 226.85; y1: 237.89; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(i) A statement of which approach for addressing non-permanence was selected in accordance with paragraph 38 of the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM </span></div><div left="121.08" right="529.02" top="178.97"><span x0="121.08" y0="178.97" x1="529.02" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 178.97; y1: 190.01; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(j) A description of how the actual net greenhouse gas removals by sinks are increased above the sum of the changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the project boundary that would have occurred in the absence of the registered small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:rect fill="gray" stroke="blue" stroke-width="0.3" x="291.839" y="739.481" width="54.24000000000001" height="0.4800000000000182"/></ns0:g></body></html>
