Small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism (CDM) shall follow the stages of the project cycle specified in the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM contained in the annex to decision 19/CP.9 (hereinafter referred to as the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM).  In order to reduce transaction costs, these modalities and procedures are simplified for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM as follows: </span></div><div left="121.08" right="530.25" top="558.05"><span x0="121.08" y0="558.05" x1="530.25" style="x0: 121.08; x1: 124.76; y0: 558.05; y1: 569.09; width: 3.68; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">(a) Project activities may be bundled or portfolio-bundled at the following stages in the project cycle: the project design document, validation, registration, monitoring, verification and certification.

Simplified baseline and monitoring methodologies may be developed for types of small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM, as presented in the list in appendix B.  This list shall not preclude other types of small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM.  If a proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM does not fall into any of the types in appendix B, the project participants may submit a request to the Executive Board of the CDM (hereinafter referred to as the Executive Board) for approval of a proposed simplified baseline and/or monitoring plan, bearing in mind the provisions in paragraph 8 below. </span></div><div left="85.08" right="533.03" top="257.81"><span x0="85.08" y0="257.81" x1="533.03" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 257.81; y1: 268.85; width: 5.52; font-size: 11.04; font-family: Times-Roman;">3. The modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM shall apply to small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM except for paragraphs 12&#8211;30.  The following paragraphs 4&#8211;29 apply instead.  Appendix A should replace, as appropriate, the provisions in appendix B of the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM.  </span></div></body></html>
