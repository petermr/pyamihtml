On the whole, this represents a decrease of approximately 13 per cent compared with the 2013&#8211;2014 biennium and can be accounted for by a reduction in the commitments made by the Climate Investment Funds, in line with changes in the climate finance landscape as the GCF only started to scale up operations in 2016.  </span></div><div left="88.1" right="345.04" top="699.35"><span x0="88.1" y0="699.35" x1="345.04" style="x0: 88.1; x1: 91.42; y0: 699.35; y1: 709.31; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">(c) Climate finance from multilateral development banks </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.94" top="681.35"><span x0="113.3" y0="681.35" x1="483.94" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 681.35; y1: 691.31; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">27. MDBs provided USD 23.4 billion and USD 25.5 billion in climate finance from their own resources to eligible recipient countries in 2015 and 2016, respectively. On average, this represents a 3.4 per cent increase from the 2013&#8211;2014 period.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="484.28" top="639.35"><span x0="113.3" y0="639.35" x1="484.28" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 639.35; y1: 649.31; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">28. The attribution of MDB finance flows to members of OECD-DAC, minus the Republic of Korea, is calculated at up to USD 17.4 billion in 2015 and USD 19.7 billion in 2016 to recipients eligible for OECD-DAC official development assistance.  </span></div><div left="87.02" right="216.62" top="591.32"><span x0="87.02" y0="591.32" x1="216.62" style="x0: 87.02; x1: 90.34; y0: 591.32; y1: 601.28; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">(d) Private climate finance  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.96" top="573.32"><span x0="113.3" y0="573.32" x1="483.96" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 573.32; y1: 583.28; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">29. The most significant source of uncertainty relates to the geographic attribution of private finance data. Although efforts have been made by MDBs and OECD since the 2016 BA to estimate private climate finance mobilized through multilateral and bilateral institutions, data on private finance sources and destinations remain lacking.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.95" top="519.32"><span x0="113.3" y0="519.32" x1="483.95" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 519.32; y1: 529.28; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">30. MDBs reported private finance mobilization in 2015 was USD 10.9 billion and increased by 43 per cent the following year to USD 15.7 billion. OECD estimated USD 21.7 billion in climate-related private finance mobilized during the period 2012&#8211;2015 by bilateral and multilateral institutions, which included USD 14 billion from multilateral providers and USD 7.7 billion from bilateral finance institutions. It is estimated that, in 2015, USD 2.3 billion was mobilized through bilateral institutions. The Climate Policy Initiative estimated renewable energy flows for new projects ranged from USD 2.4 billion in 2015 to USD 1.5 billion in 2016; this was, however, a significant underestimation given the underlying reporting approaches. </span></div><div left="88.1" right="162.71" top="399.3"><span x0="88.1" y0="399.3" x1="162.71" style="x0: 88.1; x1: 91.42; y0: 399.3; y1: 409.26; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">(e) Recipients  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.91" top="381.3"><span x0="113.3" y0="381.3" x1="483.91" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 381.3; y1: 391.26; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">31. A total of 34 Parties included in Annex I to the Convention provided information on recipients in the BR3s, while 16 out of 40 BURs submitted as first or second BURs as at October 2018 include, to varying degrees, quantitative information on climate finance received in the 2015&#8211;2016 period. Therefore, at the time of the preparation of the 2018 BA, it is not possible to present a clear picture of climate finance received on the basis of the information included in national reports submitted to the secretariat.  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="483.96" top="303.3"><span x0="113.3" y0="303.3" x1="483.96" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 303.3; y1: 313.26; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman;">32. Other sources of information provide insights on recipients. For example, of the bilateral finance reported to OECD-DAC, national and local governments received 51 and 61 per cent of bilateral climate-related assistance in 2015 and 2016, up from 43 and 42 per cent in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The remainder was received by international organizations, non-governmental organizations and public and private sector organizations from the support-providing countries. No information is available on the channels of delivery for 91&#8211;97 per cent of the other official flows of a non-concessional nature in the period 2015&#8211;2016. Of the total climate finance committed by MDBs from their own resources, 72 per cent was channelled to public sector recipients in 2015, and 74 per cent in 2016. Adaptation finance, in particular, went predominantly to public sector institutions: 90 per cent in 2015 and 97 per cent in 2016. </span></div><div left="91.7" right="225.02" top="159.27"><span x0="91.7" y0="159.27" x1="225.02" style="x0: 91.7; x1: 96.68; y0: 159.27; y1: 169.23; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: Times New Roman,Bold;">2.

Domestic climate expenditures by national and subnational governments are a potentially growing source of global climate finance, particularly as, in some cases, NDC submissions are translated into specific investment plans and domestic efforts to monitor and track the domestic climate expenditures are stepped up. However, comprehensive data on domestic climate expenditure are not readily available, as these data are not collected regularly or with a consistent methodology over time within or across countries. Of the 30 countries that reported data on climate expenditures included in the 2016 BA, 19 countries </span></div></body></html>
