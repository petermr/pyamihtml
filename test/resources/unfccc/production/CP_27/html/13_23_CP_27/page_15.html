International public climate finance flows to SIDS are predominantly adaptation focused. Grant finance plays a strong role in SIDS, ranging from 43 to 89 per cent across the channels analysed. The LDCs and SIDS have specific vulnerabilities and needs, which are partially reflected in the climate finance provided to them on a per capita basis. Per capita climate finance reached USD 3.6&#8211;16.9 for SIDS and USD 0.8&#8211;9.4 for the LDCs in 2019&#8211;2020 (see figure 4).  </span></div><div left="113.3" right="149.39" top="681.11"><span x0="113.3" y0="681.11" x1="149.39" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.84; y0: 681.11; y1: 691.07; width: 5.54; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Figure 4 </span><span x0="113.3" y0="669.11" x1="470.57" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 121.05; y0: 669.11; y1: 679.07; width: 7.75; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Geographical distribution of climate finance by volume and on a per capita basis in 2019&#8211;2020 </span></div><div left="113.3" right="128.55" top="214.5"><span x0="113.3" y0="214.5" x1="128.55" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 214.5; y1: 224.46; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">25. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="214.5" x1="483.99" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 148.38; y0: 214.5; y1: 224.46; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Between 2016 and 2020, private climate finance mobilized by developed countries for developing countries through bilateral and multilateral channels totalled USD 66.8 billion. </span><span x0="193.58" y0="190.5" x1="483.99" style="x0: 193.58; x1: 200.77; y0: 190.5; y1: 200.46; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Of this amount, 86 per cent was mobilized for mitigation actions, particularly in the energy sector (53 per cent of total mobilized finance in the five-year period). Private finance mobilized for adaptation actions targeted industry, mining and construction. Private climate finance was mobilized through number of mechanisms, dominated by direct investment in companies and special purpose vehicles, which together accounted for 44 per cent of the total. MDBs mobilized 57 per cent of total estimated private climate finance, followed by bilateral providers and multilateral climate funds. SIDS and the LDCs received 1 and 8 per cent respectively of total private finance mobilized. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="128.55" top="88.47"><span x0="113.3" y0="88.47" x1="128.55" style="x0: 113.3; x1: 118.28; y0: 88.47; y1: 98.43; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">26. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="88.47" x1="484.08" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 148.93; y0: 88.47; y1: 98.43; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Accreditation to multilateral climate funds increased by 36 per cent in 2019&#8211;2020, driven by a rising number of national and regional institutions being accredited; however, while national and regional accredited entities now account for </span></div></body></html>
