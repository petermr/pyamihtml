Methodologies for calculating climate finance based on total cost or incremental cost produce different estimates by activity. This potentially leads to limitations regarding the completeness of data and any interpretation of the relative shares of global climate finance going to different themes or sectors. Energy efficiency estimates do not include data broken down by public or private actor financial instrument, or at country level. Some data sources, such as those for renewable energy, provide activity-level data but may make country- and technology-level assumptions on finance flows to fill data gaps. In compiling data from various sources to aggregate global climate finance flows, approaches that ensure the avoidance of potential overlaps in coverage are taken; </span></div><div left="124.7" right="473.24" top="499.52"><span x0="124.7" y0="499.52" x1="473.24" style="x0: 124.7; x1: 128.02; y0: 499.52; y1: 509.48; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(e) Regarding domestic climate finance, although more countries are developing climate finance reporting systems, time lags in implementation mean data are underreported for 2019&#8211;2020. Amounts in relation to public expenditure may refer to ex ante budget allocations or ex post actual expenditures. Furthermore, the climate relevance of activities reported may refer to weighted criteria per activity or to positive activity lists;  </span></div><div left="124.7" right="473.23" top="424.52"><span x0="124.7" y0="424.52" x1="473.23" style="x0: 124.7; x1: 128.02; y0: 424.52; y1: 434.48; width: 3.32; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">(f) Data on international climate finance flows are compiled using various methodologies and have varying interpretations. Flows from developed to developing countries &#8211; covering finance provided, mobilized and received &#8211; include a mix of data based on disbursements to projects and recipients in the given year or on financial commitments made in the reporting year to activities that may be implemented over several years.

The new tables will be used for reporting from the end of 2024 in biennial transparency reports. A number of improvements will facilitate enhancing the granularity of data reported on climate finance (including sectoral and subsectoral data) and on whether the financial support also contributes to capacity-building or technology transfer, and will provide an option to report on grant-equivalent amounts of </span></div></body></html>
