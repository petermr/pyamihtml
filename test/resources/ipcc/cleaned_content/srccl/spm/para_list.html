Global models and national GHG inventories use different methods to estimate anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and removals for the land sector. Both produce estimates that are in close agreement for land-use change involving forest (e.g., deforestation, afforestation), and differ for managed forest. Global models consider as managed forest those lands that were subject to harvest whereas, consistent with IPCC guidelines, national GHG inventories define managed forest more broadly. On this larger area, inventories can also consider the natural response of land to human-induced environmental changes as anthropogenic, while the global model approach (Table SPM.1) treats this response as part of the non-anthropogenic sink. For illustration, from 2005 to 2014, the sum of the national GHG inventories net emission estimates is 0.1 &#177; 1.0 GtCO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup>, while the mean of two global bookkeeping models is 5.2 &#177; 2.6 GtCO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup> (<em>likely</em> range).

In drylands, climate change and desertification are projected to cause reductions in crop and livestock productivity (<em>high confidence</em>), modify the plant species mix and reduce biodiversity (<em>medium confidence</em>). Under SSP2, the dryland population vulnerable to water stress, drought intensity and habitat degradation is projected to reach 178 million people by 2050 at 1.5&#176;C warming, increasing to 220 million people at 2&#176;C warming, and 277 million people at 3&#176;C warming (<em>low confidence</em>). {3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.7.3}</p>

Changes in climate can amplify environmentally induced migration both within countries and across borders (<em>medium confidence</em>), reflecting multiple drivers of mobility and available adaptation measures (<em>high confidence</em>).

<strong>The level of risk posed by climate change depends both on the level of warming and on how population, consumption, production, technological development, and land management patterns evolve (<em>high confidence</em>). Pathways with higher demand for food, feed, and water, more resource-intensive consumption and production, and more limited technological improvements in agriculture yields result in higher risks from water scarcity in drylands, land degradation, and food insecurity (<em>high confidence</em>).

Projected increases in population and income, combined with changes in consumption patterns, result in increased demand for food, feed, and water in 2050 in all SSPs (<em>high confidence</em>). These changes, combined with land management practices, have implications for land-use change, food insecurity, water scarcity, terrestrial GHG emissions, carbon sequestration potential, and biodiversity (<em>high confidence</em>). Development pathways in which incomes increase and the demand for land conversion is reduced, either through reduced agricultural demand or improved productivity, can lead to reductions in food insecurity (<em>high confidence</em>). All assessed future socio-economic pathways result in increases in water demand and water scarcity (<em>high confidence</em>). SSPs with greater cropland expansion result in larger declines in biodiversity (<em>high confidence</em>). {6.1.4}</p>

Risks related to water scarcity in drylands are lower in pathways with low population growth, less increase in water demand, and high adaptive capacity, as in SSP1 {Box SPM.1}. In these scenarios the risk from water scarcity in drylands is moderate even at global warming of 3&#176;C (<em>low confidence</em>). By contrast, risks related to water scarcity in drylands are greater for pathways with high population growth, high vulnerability, higher water demand, and low adaptive capacity, such as SSP3. In SSP3 the transition from moderate to high risk occurs between 1.2&#176;C and 1.5&#176;C (<em>medium confidence</em>). (Figure SPM.2b, Box SPM.1) {7.2}</p>

Risks related to climate change driven land degradation are higher in pathways with a higher population, increased land-use change, low adaptive capacity and other barriers to adaptation (e.g., SSP3). These scenarios result in more people exposed to ecosystem degradation, fire, and coastal flooding (<em>medium confidence</em>). For land degradation, the projected transition from moderate to high risk occurs for global warming between 1.8&#176;C and 2.8&#176;C in SSP1 (<em>low confidence</em>) and between 1.4&#176;C and 2&#176;C in SSP3 (<em>medium confidence</em>).

Risks related to food security are greater in pathways with lower income, increased food demand, increased food prices resulting from competition for land, more limited trade, and other challenges to adaptation (e.g., SSP3) (<em>high confidence</em>). For food security, the transition from moderate to high risk occurs for global warming between 2.5&#176;C and 3.5&#176;C in SSP1 (<em>medium confidence</em>) and between 1.3&#176;C and 1.7&#176;C in SSP3 (<em>medium confidence</em>).
