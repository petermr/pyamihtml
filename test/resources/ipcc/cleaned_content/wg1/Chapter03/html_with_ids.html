The IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR, 1995) concluded ‘the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate’. In subsequent assessments (TAR, 2001; AR4, 2007; and AR5, 2013), the evidence for human influence on the climate system was found to have progressively strengthened. The AR5 concluded that human influence on the climate system is clear, evident from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and physical understanding of the climate system. This chapter updates the assessment of human influence on the climate system for large-scale indicators of climate change, synthesizing information from paleo records, observations and climate models. It also provides the primary evaluation of large-scale indicators of climate change in this Report, complemented by fitness-for-purpose evaluation in subsequent chapters.</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="Synthesis"><h2 class="unnumbered" lang="de-DE">Synthesis Across the Climate System<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-1-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the</span> <span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">atmosphere, ocean and land since pre-industrial times. </span>Combining the evidence from across the climate system increases the level of confidence in the attribution of observed climate change to human influence and reduces the uncertainties associated with assessments based on single variables.

It takes advantage of the longer period of record now available in many observational datasets. The assessment of the human-induced contribution to observed climate change requires an estimate of the expected response to human influence, as well as an estimate of the expected climate evolution due to natural forcings and an estimate of variability internal to the climate system (internal climate variability). For this we need high quality models, primarily climate and Earth system models. Since AR5, a new set of coordinated model results from the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6; <a class="reference-link" href="#Eyring--2016a">Eyring et al., 2016a</a>) has become available. Together with updated observations of large-scale indicators of climate change (Chapter 2), CMIP simulations are a key resource for assessing human influence on the climate system. Pre-industrial control and historical simulations are of most relevance for model evaluation and assessment of internal variability, and these simulations are evaluated to assess fitness-for-purpose for attribution, which is the focus of this chapter (see also (<a class="section-link" data-title="Modelling Techniques, Comparisons and Performance Assessments" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.5.4">Section 1.5.4</a>). This chapter provides the primary evaluation of large-scale indicators of climate change in this Report, and is complemented by other fitness-for-purpose evaluations in subsequent chapters.

This has the advantage of allowing a single discussion of the full set of explanations for any inconsistency in simulated and observed climate change, including missing forcings, errors in the simulated response to forcings, and observational errors, as well as an assessment of the application of detection and attribution techniques to model evaluation. Where simulated and observed changes are consistent, this can be interpreted both as supporting attribution statements, and as giving confidence in simulated future change in the variable concerned (see also Box 4.1). However, if a model’s simulation of historical climate change has been tuned to agree with observations, or if the models used in an attribution study have been selected or weighted on the basis of the realism of their simulated climate response, this information would need to be considered in the assessment and any attribution results correspondingly tempered.

Initially, these methods were applied to detect changes in global surface temperature, and were then extended to other climate variables at different time and spatial scales (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Hegerl--1996">Hegerl et al., 1996</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hasselmann--1997">Hasselmann, 1997</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Allen--1999">Allen and Tett, 1999</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gillett--2003b">Gillett et al., 2003b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2007">Zhang et al., 2007</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Min--2008a">Min et al., 2008a</a>, 2011). These approaches are based on multivariate linear regression and assume that the observed change consists of a linear combination of externally forced signals plus internal variability, which generally holds for large-scale variables (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hegerl--2011">Hegerl and Zwiers, 2011</a>). The regressors are the expected space–time response patterns to different climate forcings (fingerprints), and the residuals represent internal variability. Fingerprints are usually estimated from climate model simulations following spatial and temporal averaging. A regression coefficient which is significantly greater than zero implies that a detectable change is identified in the observations. When the confidence interval of the regression coefficient includes unity and is inconsistent with zero, the magnitude of the model simulated fingerprints is assessed to be consistent with the observations, implying that the observed changes can be attributed in part to a particular forcing. Variants of linear regression have been used to address uncertainty in the fingerprints due to internal variability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Allen--2003">Allen and Stott, 2003</a>) as well as structural model uncertainty (<a class="reference-link" href="#Huntingford--2006">Huntingford et al., 2006</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.2.1_p2">In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, observations and model-simulated responses are usually normalized by an estimate of internal variability derived from climate model simulations. This procedure requires an estimate of the inverse covariance matrix of the internal variability, and some approaches have been proposed for more reliable estimation of this (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ribes--2009">Ribes et al., 2009</a>). A signal can be spuriously detected due to too-small noise, and hence simulated internal variability needs to be evaluated with care. Model-simulated variability is typically checked through comparing modelled variance from unforced simulations with the observed residual variance using a standard residual consistency test (<a class="reference-link" href="#Allen--1999">Allen and Tett, 1999</a>), or an improved one (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ribes--2013">Ribes and Terray, 2013</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Imbers--2014">Imbers et al. (2014)</a> tested the sensitivity of detection and attribution results to different representations of internal variability associated with short-memory and long-memory processes. Their results supported the robustness of previous detection and attribution statements for the global mean temperature change but they also recommended the use of a wider variety of robustness tests.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.2.1_p3">Some recent studies focused on the improved estimation of the scaling factor (regression coefficient) and its confidence interval. <a class="reference-link" href="#Hannart--2014">Hannart et al. (2014)</a> described an inference procedure for scaling factors which avoids making the assumption that model error and internal variability have the same covariance structure. An integrated approach to optimal fingerprinting was further suggested in which all uncertainty sources (i.e., observational error, model error, and internal variability) are treated in one statistical model without a preliminary dimension reduction step (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hannart--2016">Hannart, 2016</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Katzfuss--2017">Katzfuss et al. (2017)</a> introduced a similar integrated approach based on a Bayesian model averaging. On the other hand, <a class="reference-link" href="#DelSole--2019">DelSole et al. (2019)</a> suggested a bootstrap method to better estimate the confidence intervals of scaling factors even in a weak-signal regime. It is notable that some studies do not optimize fingerprints, as uncertainty in the covariance introduces a further layer of complexity, but results in only a limited improvement in detection (<a class="reference-link" href="#Polson--2017">Polson and Hegerl, 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.2.1_p4">Another fingerprinting approach uses pattern similarity between observations and fingerprints, in which the leading empirical orthogonal function obtained from the time-evolving multi-model forced simulation is usually defined as a fingerprint (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Santer--2013">Santer et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Marvel--2019">Marvel et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bonfils--2020">Bonfils et al., 2020</a>). Observations and model simulations are then projected onto the fingerprint to measure the degree of spatial pattern similarity with the expected physical response to a given forcing. This projection provides the signal time series, which is in turn tested against internal variability, as estimated from long control simulations. As a way to extend this pattern-based approach to a high-dimensional detection variable at daily time scales, Sippel et al. (2019, 2020) proposed using the relationship pattern with a global climate change metric as a fingerprint. To solve the high-dimensional regression problem which makes regression coefficients not well constrained, they incorporated a statistical learning technique based on a regularized linear regression, which optimizes a global warming signal by giving lower weight to regions with large internal variability.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="3.2.2"><h3 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">3.2.2 Other Probabilistic Approaches<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-2-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.2.2_p1">Considering the difficulty in accounting for climate modelling uncertainties in the regression-based approaches, <a class="reference-link" href="#Ribes--2017">Ribes et al.

The method was further developed by <a class="reference-link" href="#Ribes--2021">Ribes et al.

On the other hand, <a class="reference-link" href="#Schurer--2018">Schurer et al. (2018)</a> employed a Bayesian framework to explicitly consider climate modelling uncertainty in the optimal regression method.

The AR5 found that CMIP5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Taylor--2012">Taylor et al., 2012</a>) models were able to reproduce the large-scale patterns of temperature during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Flato--2013">Flato et al., 2013</a>) and simulated a polar amplification broadly consistent with reconstructions for warm (Pliocene and Eocene) and cold (LGM) periods (<a class="reference-link" href="#Masson-Delmotte--2013">Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013</a>). Since AR5, a better understanding of temperature proxies and their uncertainties and in some cases the forcing applied to model simulations has led to better agreement between models and reconstructions over a wide range of past climates. For the Pliocene and Eocene warm periods, understanding of uncertainties in temperature proxies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hollis--2019">Hollis et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McClymont--2020">McClymont et al., 2020</a>) and the boundary conditions used in climate simulations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Haywood--2016">Haywood et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lunt--2017">Lunt et al., 2017</a>) has improved, and some models now agree better with temperature proxies for these time periods compared to models assessed in AR5 (Sections 7.4.4.1.2, 7.4.4.2.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 2.4; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhu--2019">Zhu et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Haywood--2020">Haywood et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lunt--2021">Lunt et al., 2021</a>). For the Last Interglacial (LIG), improved temporal resolution of temperature proxies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Capron--2017">Capron et al., 2017</a>) and better appreciation of the importance of freshwater forcing (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stone--2016">Stone et al., 2016</a>) have clarified the reasons behind apparent model-data inconsistencies. Regional LIG temperature responses simulated by CMIP6 are within the uncertainty ranges of reconstructed temperature responses, except in regions where unresolved changes in regional ocean circulation, meltwater, or vegetation changes may cause model mismatches (<a class="reference-link" href="#Otto-Bliesner--2021">Otto-Bliesner et al., 2021</a>). For the LGM, the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles compare similarly to new sea surface temperature (SST) and surface air temperature (SAT) proxy reconstructions (Figure 3.2a; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cleator--2020">Cleator et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tierney--2020b">Tierney et al., 2020b</a>). The very cold CMIP6 LGM simulation by the Community Earth System Model Version 2.1 (CESM2.1) is an exception related to the high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of that model (Section 7.5.6; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kageyama--2021a">Kageyama et al., 2021a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhu--2021">Zhu et al., 2021</a>). Figure 3.2a illustrates the wide range of simulated global LGM temperature responses in both ensembles. CMIP6 models tend to underestimate the cooling over land, but agree better with oceanic reconstructions. For the mid-Holocene, the regional biases found in CMIP5 simulations are similar to those in pre-industrial and historical simulations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Harrison--2015">Harrison et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ackerley--2017">Ackerley et al., 2017</a>), suggesting common causes. CMIP5 models underestimate Arctic warming in the mid-Holocene (<a class="reference-link" href="#Yoshimori--2019">Yoshimori and Suzuki, 2019</a>). CMIP6 models simulate a mid-latitude, subtropical, and tropical cooling compared to the pre-industrial period, whereas temperature proxies indicate a warming (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Temperatures of the post-glacial period (past 7000 years)" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.1.1.2">Section 2.3.1.1.2</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Brierley--2020">Brierley et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kaufman--2020">Kaufman et al., 2020</a>), although accounting for seasonal effects in the proxies may reduce the discrepancy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bova--2021">Bova et al., 2021</a>). Over the past millennium, reconstructed and simulated temperature anomalies, internal variability, and forced response agree well over Northern Hemisphere continents, but those statistics disagree strongly in the Southern Hemisphere, where models seem to overestimate the response (<a class="reference-link" href="#PAGES%202k-PMIP3%20group--2015">PAGES 2k-PMIP3 group, 2015</a>).

As also indicated by Figure 3.4, the spread in simulated absolute temperatures is large (<a class="reference-link" href="#Palmer--2019">Palmer and Stevens, 2019</a>). However, the discussion is based on temperature anomaly time series instead of absolute temperatures because our focus is on evaluation of the simulation of climate change in these models, and also because anomalies are more uniformly distributed and are more easily deseasonalized to isolate long-term trends (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Baselines, Reference Periods and Anomalies" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.4.1">Section 1.4.1</a>).

The CMIP6 multi-model ensemble encompasses observed warming and the multi-model mean tracks those observations within 0.2°C over most of the historical period. Figure 3.4 confirms the findings of <a class="reference-link" href="#Papalexiou--2020">Papalexiou et al. (2020)</a>, who highlighted based on 29 CMIP6 models that most models replicate the period of slow warming between 1942 and 1975 and the late twentieth century warming (1975–2014). The CMIP6 multi-model mean is cooler over the period 1980–2000 than both observations and CMIP5 (Figure 3.4; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bock--2020">Bock et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Flynn--2020">Flynn and Mauritsen, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gillett--2021">Gillett et al., 2021</a>). Biases of several tenths of a degree in some CMIP6 models over that period may be due to an overestimate in aerosol radiative forcing (Sections 6.3.5 and 7.3.3, and Figure 6.8; <a class="reference-link" href="#Andrews--2020">Andrews et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dittus--2020">Dittus et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Flynn--2020">Flynn and Mauritsen, 2020</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Papalexiou--2020">Papalexiou et al.

(2021)</a> all report that CMIP6 models on average overestimate warming from the 1970s or 1980s to the 2010s, although quantitative conclusions depend on which observational dataset is compared against (see also Table 2.4). However, Figure 3.4, which includes a larger number of models than available to those studies, indicates that the CMIP6 multi-model mean tracks observed warming better than the CMIP5 multi-model mean after the year 2000. The CMIP6 multi-model mean GSAT warming between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 and associated 5–95% range is 1.09 [0.66 to 1.64] °C. Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 assessed GSAT warming over the same period at 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21] °C. So some CMIP6 models simulate a warming that is smaller than the assessed observed range, and other CMIP6 models simulate a warming that is larger. That overestimated warming may be an early symptom of overestimated ECS in some CMIP6 models (Section 7.5.6; <a class="reference-link" href="#Meehl--2020">Meehl et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schlund--2020">Schlund et al., 2020</a>), and has implications for projections of GSAT changes (Chapter 4; <a class="reference-link" href="#Liang--2020">Liang et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nijsse--2020">Nijsse et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tokarska--2020">Tokarska et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ribes--2021">Ribes et al., 2021</a>). In some models, a large ECS and a strong aerosol forcing lead to too large a mid-20th century cooling followed by overestimated warming rates in the late 20th century when aerosol emissions decrease (<a class="reference-link" href="#Golaz--2019">Golaz et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Flynn--2020">Flynn and Mauritsen, 2020</a>).

(2021)</a> point instead to missed compensating effects on surface temperature change associated with internal variability in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). An alternative view sees those ENSO and AMO responses as expressions of changes in climate feedbacks driven by the geographical pattern of SST changes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Andrews--2018">Andrews et al., 2018</a>). At least one model is able to reproduce such pattern effects (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gregory--2016">Gregory and Andrews, 2016</a>). Errors in the volcanic forcing prescribed in simulations, including for CMIP6 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rieger--2020">Rieger et al., 2020</a>), also introduce differences with the observed temperature response, independently of the quality of the model physics. In addition, comparisons of the modelled temperature response to large eruptions over the past millennium to temperature reconstructions based on tree rings show a much better agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#L%C3%BCcke--2019">Lücke et al., 2019</a>; F. <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhu--2020"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhu--2020">Zhu et al., 2020</a>) than comparisons to the annual, multi-temperature proxy reconstructions shown in Figure 3.2c. These considerations, and Figures 3.2c and 3.4, suggest that CMIP6 models do not systematically overestimate the cooling that follows large volcanic eruptions (see also Cross-Chapter Box 4.1).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.3.1.1.1_p10">When interpreting model simulations of historical temperature change, it is important to keep in mind that some models are tuned towards representing the observed trend in global mean surface temperature over the historical period (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hourdin--2017">Hourdin et al., 2017</a>). In Figure 3.4 the CMIP6 models that are documented to have been tuned to reproduce observed warming, typically by tuning aerosol forcing or factors that influence the model’s ECS, are marked with an asterisk. Such tuning of a model can strongly impact its temperature projections (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mauritsen--2020">Mauritsen and Roeckner, 2020</a>). However, <a class="reference-link" href="#Bock--2020">Bock et al.

Moreover, only two of thirteen models used for the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) simulations on which CMIP6 attribution studies are based were tuned towards historical warming (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bock--2020">Bock et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gillett--2021">Gillett et al., 2021</a>). Further, tuning is done on globally averaged quantities, so does not substantially change the spatio-temporal pattern of response on which many regression-based attribution studies are based (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bock--2020">Bock et al., 2020</a>). Therefore, we assess with <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> that the tuning of a small number of CMIP6 models to observed warming has not substantially influenced attribution results assessed in this chapter.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.3.1.1.1_p11">The reliance of detection and attribution studies on climate models (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Methods" href="#3.2">Section 3.2</a>) requires that those models simulate realistic statistics of internal variability on multi-decadal time scales. An incorrect estimate of variability in models would affect confidence in the conclusions from detection and attribution. The AR5 found that CMIP5 models simulate realistic variability in global-mean surface temperature on decadal time scales, with variability on multi-decadal time scales being more difficult to evaluate because of the short observational record (<a class="reference-link" href="#Flato--2013">Flato et al., 2013</a>). Since AR5, new work has characterized the contributions of variability in different ocean areas to SST variability, with tropical modes of variability like ENSO dominant on time scales of five to ten years, while longer time scales see the variance maxima move poleward to the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern oceans (<a class="reference-link" href="#Monselesan--2015">Monselesan et al., 2015</a>). There may, however, be sizeable, two-way interdependencies between ENSO and sea surface temperature variability in different basins (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kumar--2014">Kumar et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cai--2019">Cai et al., 2019</a>), and ENSO’s influence on global surface temperature variability may not be confined only to decadal time scales (<a class="reference-link" href="#Triacca--2014">Triacca et al., 2014</a>). Studies based on large ensembles of 20th and 21st century climate change simulations confirm that internal variability has a substantial influence on global warming trends over periods shorter than 30–40 years (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kay--2015">Kay et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dai--2019">Dai and Bloecker, 2019</a>). Although the equatorial Pacific seems to be the main source of internal variability on decadal time scales, <a class="reference-link" href="#Brown--2016a">Brown et al.

Evidence coming mostly from paleo studies is mixed on whether CMIP5 models underestimate decadal and multi-decadal variability in global mean temperature. <a class="reference-link" href="#Schurer--2013">Schurer et al. (2013)</a> found good agreement between internal variability derived from paleo reconstructions, estimated as the fraction of variance that is not explained by forced responses, and modelled variability, although the subset of CMIP5 models they used may have been associated with larger variability than the full CMIP5 ensemble. <a class="reference-link" href="#PAGES%202k%20Consortium--2019">PAGES 2k Consortium (2019)</a> found that the largest 51-year trends in both reconstructions of global mean temperature and fully forced climate simulations over the period 850 to 1850 were almost identical. <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhu--2019">Zhu et al. (2019)</a> showed agreement in the modelled and reconstructed temporal spectrum of global surface temperatures on annual to multi-millennial time scales. However, they suggest that decadal- to centennial variability is partly forced by slow orbital changes that predate the last millennium. This is consistent with <a class="reference-link" href="#Gebbie--2019">Gebbie and Huybers (2019)</a>, who showed that the deep ocean has been out of equilibrium over that period. <a class="reference-link" href="#Laepple--2014">Laepple and Huybers (2014)</a> found good agreement between modelled and proxy-derived decadal ocean temperature variability, but underestimates of variance by models by at least a factor of ten at centennial time scales because models underestimate the difference between the warm and cold periods of the last millennium. <a class="reference-link" href="#Parsons--2020">Parsons et al. (2020)</a> found that some CMIP6 models exhibit much higher multi-decadal variability in GSAT than CMIP5 models, with indications that variability in these models is also higher than that from proxy reconstructions. CMIP6 models may not share the underestimation by CMIP5 models of variability in decadal to multi-decadal modes of variability, such as Pacific Decadal Variability (<a class="section-link" data-title="Pacific Decadal Variability" href="#3.7.6">Section 3.7.6</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#England--2014">England et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Thompson--2014">Thompson et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schurer--2015">Schurer et al., 2015</a>) and Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV), which may be partly forced, (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability" href="#3.7.7">Section 3.7.7</a>) but this assessment is limited by the small number of available studies. For the Southern Hemisphere, <a class="reference-link" href="#Hegerl--2018">Hegerl et al.

(2020)</a> found biases in interhemispheric SST contrast in some models that may be consistent with underestimated cooling after early-20th century eruptions or underestimated Pacific Decadal Variability, but could also be due to an imperfect separation between internal variability and forced signal in the observations. Figure 3.2c, updated from <a class="reference-link" href="#PAGES%202k%20Consortium--2019">PAGES 2k Consortium (2019)</a>, compares modelled temperatures to reconstructions over the last millennium. It indicates that models reproduce the observed variability well, at least for the time scales between 20 and 50 years that paleo reconstructions typically resolve and that the figure represents. In summary, decadal GMST variability simulated in CMIP6 models spans the range of residual decadal variability in large-scale reconstructions (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">medium evidence</i>, <i class="•-Condensed-italic">low agreement</i>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.3.1.1.1_p13">In addition, new literature suggests that anthropogenic forcing itself may locally increase or decrease variability in surface temperatures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Screen--2014">Screen et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Qian--2015">Qian and Zhang, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Brown--2017">Brown et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Park--2018">Park et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Santer--2018">Santer et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Weller--2020">Weller et al., 2020</a>).

Still, the unforced variability of the five most variable models approaches half that observed over the historical period under anthropogenically forced conditions (Figure 3.6c; <a class="reference-link" href="#Parsons--2020">Parsons et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ribes--2021">Ribes et al., 2021</a>). For the Centre National de la Recherche Météorologique (CNRM) models, which are among the most variable, the large, low-frequency variability is attributed to strong simulated Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (<a class="reference-link" href="#S%C3%A9f%C3%A9rian--2019">Séférian et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Voldoire--2019b">Voldoire et al., 2019b</a>), which is difficult to rule out because of the short observational record (<a class="section-link" data-title="Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability" href="#3.7.7">Section 3.7.7</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cassou--2018">Cassou et al., 2018</a>). But, importantly, patterns of temperature variability simulated by even the most variable models differ from the pattern of forced temperature change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parsons--2020">Parsons et al., 2020</a>). Taken together, this discussion and Figures 3.2, 3.5 and 3.6 indicate that the statistics of internal variability in models compare well in most cases to observational estimates and temperature proxy reconstructions, though some CMIP6 models appear to have higher multi-decadal variability than CMIP5 models or proxy reconstructions. When used in attribution studies, models with overestimated variability would increase estimated uncertainties and make results statistically conservative.</p><div class="Basic-Text-Frame" id="_idContainer018"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-9" id="figure-3-6" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_3_6.png"></span></strong><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Figure 3.6 | Simulated internal variability of global surface air temperature (GSAT) versus observed changes.

While some attribution studies estimate attributable changes in globally-complete GSAT (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schurer--2018">Schurer et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gillett--2021">Gillett et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ribes--2021">Ribes et al., 2021</a>), others attribute changes in observational GMST, but this makes little difference to attribution conclusions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schurer--2018">Schurer et al., 2018</a>). Moreover, based on a synthesis of observational and modelling evidence, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 assesses that the current best estimate of the scaling factor between GMST and GSAT is one, and therefore attribution studies of GMST and GSAT are here treated together in deriving assessed warming ranges. Studies also increasingly validate their multi-model approaches using imperfect model tests (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schurer--2018">Schurer et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gillett--2021">Gillett et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ribes--2021">Ribes et al., 2021</a>).

The larger range of attribution techniques and improvements to those techniques increase confidence in the results compared to AR5.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.3.1.1.2_p3">In contrast, studies published since AR5 indicate that closely constraining the separate contributions of greenhouse gas changes and aerosol changes to observed temperature changes remains challenging. Nonetheless, attribution of warming to greenhouse gas forcing has been found as early as the end of the 19th century (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schurer--2014">Schurer et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Owens--2017">Owens et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#PAGES%202k%20Consortium--2019">PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Hegerl--2019">Hegerl et al. (2019)</a> found that volcanism cooled global temperatures by about 0.1°C between 1870 and 1910, then a lack of volcanic activity warmed temperatures by about 0.1°C between 1910 and 1950, with anthropogenic aerosols cooling temperatures throughout the 20th century, especially between 1950 and 1980 when the estimated <i class="•-Condensed-italic"></i>range of aerosol cooling was about 0.1°C to 0.5°C. <a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2016">Jones et al. (2016)</a> attributed a warming of 0.87 to 1.22°C per century over the period 1906 to 2005 to greenhouse gases, partially offset by a cooling of −0.54°C to −0.22°C per century attributed to aerosols. But they also found that detection of the greenhouse gas or the aerosol signal often fails, because of uncertainties in modelled patterns of change and internal variability. That point is illustrated by Figure 3.7, which shows two- and three-way fingerprinting regression coefficients for 13 CMIP6 models and the corresponding attributable warming ranges, derived using HadCRUT4 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gillett--2021">Gillett et al., 2021</a>). Regression coefficients with an uncertainty range that includes zero mean that detection has failed. Models with regression coefficients significantly less than one significantly overpredict the temperature response to the corresponding forcing. Conversely, models with regression coefficients significantly greater than one underpredict the response to these forcings. While estimates of warming attributable to anthropogenic influence derived using individual models are generally consistent, estimates of warming attributable to greenhouse gases and aerosols separately based on individual models are not all consistent, and detection of the aerosol influence fails more often than that of greenhouse gases. Hence, results of recent studies emphasize the need to use multi-model means to better constrain estimates of GSAT changes attributable to greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schurer--2018">Schurer et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gillett--2021">Gillett et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ribes--2021">Ribes et al., 2021</a>).</p><div class="Basic-Text-Frame" id="_idContainer020"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-10" id="figure-3-7" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_3_7.png"></span></strong><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title">Figure 3.7 | </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Regression coefficients and corresponding attributable warming estimates for individual CMIP6 models. </span>Upper panels show regression coefficients based on a two-way regression <span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> (left) </span> and three-way regression <span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> (right)</span>, of observed five-year mean, globally averaged, masked and blended surface temperature (HadCRUT4) onto individual model response patterns, and a multi-model mean, labelled ‘Multi’.

As stated above, warming results from a partial offset of greenhouse gas warming by aerosol cooling. That offset is stronger over land than ocean.

The IPCC SR1.5 reached the same conclusion for 2017 relative to 1850–1900 based on anthropogenic warming and associated uncertainties calculated using the method of <a class="reference-link" href="#Haustein--2017">Haustein et al.

Moreover, the improved understanding of the causes of the apparent slowdown in warming over the beginning of the 21st century and the difference in simulated and observed warming trends over this period (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1) further improve our confidence in the assessment of the dominant anthropogenic contribution to observed warming. In deriving our assessments, these considerations are balanced against new literature that raises questions about the ability of some models to simulate variability in surface temperatures over a range of time scales (<a class="reference-link" href="#Laepple--2014">Laepple and Huybers, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Parsons--2017">Parsons et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Friedman--2020">Friedman et al., 2020</a>), and the finding that some CMIP6 models exhibit substantially higher multi-decadal internal variability than that seen in CMIP5, which remains to be fully understood (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parsons--2020">Parsons et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ribes--2021">Ribes et al., 2021</a>). Further, uncertainties in simulated aerosol-cloud interactions are still large (Section 7.3.3.2.2), resulting in very diverse spatial responses of different climate models to aerosol forcing, and inter-model differences in the historical global mean temperature evolution and in diagnosed cooling attributable to aerosols (Figure 3.8). Moreover, like previous generations of coupled model simulations, historical and single forcing CMIP6 simulations follow a common experimental design (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eyring--2016a">Eyring et al., 2016a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gillett--2016">Gillett et al., 2016</a>) and are thus all driven by the same common set of forcings, even though these forcings are uncertain. Hence, forcing uncertainty is not directly accounted for in most of the attribution and model evaluation studies assessed here, although this limitation can to some extent be addressed by comparing with previous generation multi-model ensembles or individual model studies using different sets of forcings.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.3.1.1.2_p10">The IPCC SR1.5 best estimate and <i class="•-Condensed-italic">likely </i>range of anthropogenic attributable GMST warming was 1.0 ± 0.2°C in 2017 with respect to the period 1850–1900.

However, models do not appear to reproduce the zonal mean trends in the magnitude of the seasonal cycle over the period 1948–2005, nor the two-dimensional distributions of trends of annual precipitation and seasonality over land, but differences may be explainable by internal variability (X. <a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2016"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2016">Li et al., 2016</a>b).

The persistent biases include the double ITCZ in the tropical Pacific (seen as bands of excessive rainfall on both sides of the equatorial Pacific in Figure 3.13b,d) and the southward-shifted ITCZ in the equatorial Atlantic, which have been linked to the meridional pattern of SST bias (S. <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhou--2020"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhou--2020">Zhou et al., 2020</a>) and the reduced sensitivity of precipitation to local SST (<a class="reference-link" href="#Good--2021">Good et al., 2021</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Tian--2020">Tian and Dong (2020)</a> also found that all three generations of CMIP models share similar systematic annual mean precipitation errors in the tropics, but that the double ITCZ bias is slightly reduced in CMIP6 models in comparison to CMIP3 and CMIP5 models.

(2020)</a> identified improvements in the tropical mean spatial correlations and root mean square error of the climatology as well as in the day-to-day variability, but found little change across CMIP phases in the double ITCZ bias and diurnal cycle. The CMIP6 models reproduce better the domain and intensity of the global monsoon (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Global Monsoon" href="#3.3.3.2">Section 3.3.3.2</a>).

As a result, pattern correlations between simulated and observed annual mean precipitation range between 0.80 and 0.92 for CMIP6 models, compared to a range of 0.79 to 0.88 for CMIP5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bock--2020">Bock et al., 2020</a>). This relative improvement may be related to increased model resolution, as found when comparing biases in the mean of the HighResMIP models with the mean of the corresponding lower-resolution versions of the same models (see Figure 3.13e,f), particularly in the tropics and extratropical storm tracks. Consistent with this, a recent study using several coupled models showed that increasing the atmospheric resolution leads to a strong decrease in the precipitation bias in the tropical Atlantic ITCZ (see further discussion in <a class="section-link" data-title="Process Representation in Different Classes of Models" href="#3.8.2.2">Section 3.8.2.2</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Vanni%C3%A8re--2019">Vannière et al., 2019</a>).

For example, the highest daily temperature in a summer is often highly correlated with the summer mean temperature. Model projections show that changes in temperature extremes are often closely related to shifts in mean temperature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2016">Seneviratne et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kharin--2018">Kharin et al., 2018</a>). It is thus no surprise that changes in temperature extremes are consistent with warming mean temperature, with warming leading to more hot extremes and fewer cold extremes. Given the attribution of mean warming to human influence (<a class="section-link" data-title="Temperature" href="#3.3.1">Section 3.3.1</a>), and the connection between changes in mean and extreme temperatures, it is to be expected that anthropogenic forcing has also influenced temperature extremes.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" id="cross-chapter-box-3.2_p5">(<a class="section-link" data-title="Weather and Climate Extreme Events in a Changing Climate" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11">Chapter 11</a> assesses that there is <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> that climate models can reproduce the mean state and overall warming of temperature extremes observed globally and in most regions, although the magnitude of the trends may differ, and the ability of models to capture observed trends in temperature-related extremes depends on the metric evaluated, the way indices are calculated, and the time periods and spatial scales considered (Section 11.3.3). There has been widespread evidence of human influence on various aspects of temperature extremes, at global, continental, and regional scales. This includes attribution to human influence of observed changes in intensity, frequency, and duration and other relevant characteristics at global and continental scales (Section 11.3.4). The left-hand panel of Cross-Chapter Box 3.2, Figure 1 clearly shows that long-term changes in the global mean annual maximum daily maximum temperature can be reproduced by both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models forced with the combined effect of natural and anthropogenic forcings, but cannot be reproduced by simulations under natural forcing alone. Consistent with the assessment for global mean temperature (<a class="section-link" data-title="Temperature" href="#3.3.1">Section 3.3.1</a>), aerosol changes are found to have offset part of the greenhouse gas induced increase in hot extremes globally and over most continents over the 1951–2015 period (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hu--2020">Hu et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Seong--2021">Seong et al., 2021</a>), though greenhouse gas and aerosol influences are less clearly separable in observed changes in cold extremes.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" id="cross-chapter-box-3.2_p6">(<a class="section-link" data-title="Weather and Climate Extreme Events in a Changing Climate" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11">Chapter 11</a> assesses that it is <i class="•-Condensed-italic">virtually certain</i> that human-induced greenhouse gas forcing is the main contributor to the observed increase in the likelihood and severity of hot extremes and the observed decrease in the likelihood and severity of cold extremes on global scales, and <i class="•-Condensed-italic">very likely </i> that this applies on most continents.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-subhead-H1---no-space-below" id="cross-chapter-box-3.2_p7">Attribution of precipitation extremes</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" id="cross-chapter-box-3.2_p8">An important piece of evidence supporting the SREX and AR5 assessment that there is <i class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</i> that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to a global scale intensification of heavy precipitation during the second half of the 20th century is the evidence for anthropogenic influence on other aspects of the global hydrological cycle. The most significant aspect of that is the increase in atmospheric moisture content associated with warming which should, in general, lead to enhanced extreme precipitation, particularly associated with enhanced convergence in tropical and extratropical cyclones (Sections 8.2.3.2 and 11.4.1). Such a connection is supported by the fact that annual maximum one-day precipitation increases with global mean temperature at a rate similar to the increase in the moisture holding capacity in response to warming, both in observations and in model simulations. Additionally, models project an increase in extreme precipitation across global land regions even in areas in which total annual or seasonal precipitation is projected to decrease.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body ParaOverride-4" id="cross-chapter-box-3.2_p9">The overall performance of CMIP6 models in simulating extreme precipitation intensity and frequency is similar to that of CMIP5 models (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>), and there is <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> in the ability of models to capture the large-scale spatial distribution of precipitation extremes over land (Section 11.4.3).

Both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models simulate strong declines in spring SCE during recent years, in general agreement with observations, causing the multi-model mean decreasing trend in spring SCE to now better agree with observations than in earlier evaluations.

Such deficiencies in the representation of snow in climate models mean there is <i class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</i> in the simulation of snow cover over the northern continents in CMIP6 model simulations. The models consistently link snow extent to surface air temperature (Figure 9.24). With warming of near-surface air linked to anthropogenic influence, and particularly to greenhouse gas increases (<a class="section-link" data-title="Surface Temperature" href="#3.3.1.1">Section 3.3.1.1</a>), this provides additional evidence that reductions in snow cover are also caused by human activity.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="3.4.3"><h2 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">3.4.3 Glaciers and Ice Sheets<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-14-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.4.3_p1">While (<a class="section-link" data-title="Ocean, Cryosphere and Sea Level Change" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-9">Chapter 9</a> (Sections 9.4 and 9.5) discusses process understanding for glaciers and ice sheets, as well as evaluation of global and regional-scale glacier and ice-sheet models, our focus here is on the attribution of large-scale changes in glaciers and ice sheets. Land ice in the form of glaciers has been included in CMIP climate and Earth system models as components of the land surface models for many years. However, their representation is simplified and is omitted altogether in the less complex modelling systems. In CMIP3 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Meehl--2007">Meehl et al., 2007</a>) and CMIP5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Taylor--2012">Taylor et al., 2012</a>) land ice area fraction, a component of land surface models, was defined as a time-independent quantity, and in most model configurations was preset at the simulation initialization as a permanent land feature. In CMIP6 considerable progress has been made in improving and evaluating the representation of modelled land ice. For glaciers, an example is the expansion of the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model to enable elevated tiles, and hence more accurately simulate the altitudinal atmospheric effects on glaciers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shannon--2019">Shannon et al., 2019</a>).

We note that while an updated observational temperature dataset is used in this assessment (WOA09 was used in AR5, while WOA18, 1981–2010 is used in AR6), the deep-ocean warm bias remains and is approaching double the magnitude (about 0.5°C) of the equivalent CMIP5 multi-model mean bias, a feature which is particularly prominent in the Atlantic and southern Indian Oceans. Increased horizontal resolution as well as the choice of the vertical coordinate are reported to partly improve these biases in some models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adcroft--2019">Adcroft et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rackow--2019">Rackow et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hewitt--2020">Hewitt et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.5.1.1_p8">Since AR5, there has been growing evidence that the representation of mean surface and deeper ocean temperatures in coupled climate models can be improved by increasing the horizontal resolution both in the ocean and the atmosphere (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Small--2014">Small et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hewitt--2016">Hewitt et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Iovino--2016">Iovino et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2019">Roberts et al., 2019</a>). At an ocean resolution of around 1°, which is typical of CMIP6 models, some processes are parameterized rather than explicitly resolved, leading to a compromise in their dynamical representation. An increase in the model resolution allows for processes to be explicitly resolved, and can for example, enhance the simulation of eddies, thus improving simulated vertical eddy transport, and reducing temperature drifts in the deeper ocean (<a class="reference-link" href="#Griffies--2015">Griffies et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#von%20Storch--2016">von Storch et al., 2016</a>). For some models, the mean absolute error in ocean temperature below 500 m is smaller in the high resolution version compared to the low resolution version, particularly in eddy-active regions such as the North Atlantic (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rackow--2019">Rackow et al., 2019</a>). Increasing the horizontal resolution of individual climate models often leads to an overall decrease in the surface temperature biases over regions where they persisted through earlier CMIP generations, such as the central and western equatorial Pacific, as well as the North and tropical Atlantic (Figure 3.3e; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2019">Roberts et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hewitt--2020">Hewitt et al., 2020</a>). Despite this, as a group the four HighResMIP models included in Figures 3.3e and 3.24 do not on average show smaller SST biases than the CMIP6 multi-model mean, demonstrating the importance of factors other than resolution in contributing to SST biases.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.5.1.1_p9">In summary, there is little improvement in the multi-model mean sea surface and zonal mean ocean temperatures from CMIP5 to CMIP6 (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</i>).

Misrepresentation of the interaction between the atmosphere and ocean via the Bjerknes feedback and vertical mixing parameterizations, and a bias in winds were among the suggested reasons for the persistent biases (<a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2014">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhu--2018">Zhu and Zhang, 2018</a>). Moving to CMIP6, a reduction of the cold bias in the equatorial cold tongue in the central Pacific is found on average in the CMIP6 models (Figure 3.24b; <a class="reference-link" href="#Grose--2020">Grose et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Planton--2021">Planton et al., 2021</a>), however, this reduced bias is not statistically significant when considered across the multi-model ensemble (<a class="reference-link" href="#Planton--2021">Planton et al., 2021</a>).

The latter result implies that there is an improvement in the representation of the tropical Pacific mean state in CMIP6 models. Comparison of biases in individual HighResMIP models with biases in lower resolution versions of the same models indicates that there is no consistent improvement in SST biases in most of the equatorial Pacific with resolution (Figure 3.3e; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bock--2020">Bock et al., 2020</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h4-container" id="3.5.1.2.2"><h4 class="numbered">3.5.1.2.2 Tropical Atlantic Ocean<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h4><div class="h4-siblings" id="h4-11-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.5.1.2.2_p1">Fundamental features such as the mean zonal SST gradient in the tropical Atlantic were not reproduced in CMIP5 models.

RAPID observations show that the overturning at 26°N was 2.9 Sv weaker in the multi-year average of 2008–2012 relative to 2004–2008 and 2.5 Sv weaker in 2012–2017 relative to 2004–2008 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smeed--2014">Smeed et al., 2014</a>, <a class="reference-link" href="#Smeed--2018">2018</a>) (see also (<a class="section-link" data-title="Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.3.4.1">Section 2.3.3.4.1</a>). As expected, this weakening was accompanied by a significant reduction in northward heat transport (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bryden--2020">Bryden et al., 2020</a>). CMIP5 and CMIP6 models produce a forced weakening of the AMOC over the 2012–2017 period relative to 2004–2008, but at 26°N the multi-model mean response is substantially weaker than the observed AMOC decline over the same period. The discrepancy between the modelled multi-model mean (i.e., the forced response) and the RAPID observed AMOC changes has led studies to suggest that the observed weakening over 2004–2017 is largely due to internal variability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Yan--2018">Yan et al., 2018</a>). However, comparison of observed RAPID AMOC variability with modelled variability also reveals that most CMIP5 models appear to underestimate the interannual and decadal time scale AMOC variability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2014">Roberts et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yan--2018">Yan et al., 2018</a>), and, although the overall variance is larger in CMIP6 than in CMIP5, similar results are found analysing the CMIP6 models (Figure 3.30b,c). It is currently unknown why most models underestimate this AMOC variability, or whether they are underestimating the internal or externally forced components. This underestimation of AMOC variability may also have potential implications for detection and attribution, the relationship between AMOC and AMV (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability" href="#3.7.7">Section 3.7.7</a>), and near-term predictions. There is also emerging evidence, based on analysis of freshwater transports, that the AMOC in CMIP5-era models is too stable, largely due to systematic biases in ocean salinity (W. <a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2017"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2017">Liu et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mecking--2017">Mecking et al., 2017</a>).

However, models simulate a range of anthropogenic aerosol effective radiative forcing and a range of historical AMOC trends in CMIP6 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Menary--2020">Menary et al., 2020</a>) and there remains considerable uncertainty over the realism of the CMIP6 AMOC response during the 20th century (Figure 3.30d–f) due to disagreement among the differing lines of evidence. For example, ocean reanalysis (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jackson--2019">Jackson et al., 2019</a>) and forced ocean model simulations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Robson--2012">Robson et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Danabasoglu--2016">Danabasoglu et al., 2016</a>), which show AMOC changes that are broadly consistent with the CMIP6 response, appear to disagree with observational estimates of AMOC over the historical period (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ezer--2013">Ezer et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Caesar--2018">Caesar et al., 2018</a>). It is noted, however, that the relatively short length of the forced ocean simulations and ocean reanalysis precludes a comparable assessment of 20th century trends. Furthermore, despite the similar AMOC evolution seen in forced ocean model simulations and the CMIP6 models, it is unclear whether the same underlying mechanisms are responsible for the changes.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.5.4.1_p7">In summary, models do not support robust assessment of the role of anthropogenic forcing in the observed AMOC weakening between the mid-2000s and the mid-2010s, which is assessed to have occurred with <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> in <a class="section-link" data-title="Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.3.4.1">Section 2.3.3.4.1</a>, as the changes are outside of the range of modelled AMOC trends (regardless of whether they are forced or internally generated) in most models.

The latter of these developments is particularly significant for projections of ocean stressors as it directly affects the representation of stratification. Updates in the representation of ocean biogeochemical processes between CMIP5 and CMIP6 have typically involved an increase in model complexity. Specific developments have been the more widespread inclusion of micronutrients, such as iron, variable stoichiometric ratios, more detailed representation of lower trophic levels including bacteria and the cycling and sinking of organic matter. CMIP6 biogeochemical model performance is generally an improvement on that of the parent CMIP5 generation of models (<a class="reference-link" href="#S%C3%A9f%C3%A9rian--2020">Séférian et al., 2020</a>). The global representation of present-day air-sea carbon fluxes and surface chlorophyll concentrations show moderate improvements between CMIP5 and CMIP6. Similar improvements are seen in the representation of subsurface oxygen concentrations in most ocean basins, while the representation of surface macronutrient concentrations in CMIP6 is shown to have improved with respect to silicic acid but declined slightly with respect to nitrate. Model representation of the micronutrient iron has not improved substantially since CMIP5, but many more models are capable of representing iron. In addition, a comparison of the carbon concentration and carbon climate feedbacks shows no significant change between CMIP5 and CMIP6 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arora--2020">Arora et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.6.2_p2">Since AR5, research has also focused on the detection and attribution of regional patterns in ocean biogeochemical change relating to interior deoxygenation, air-sea CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> flux, and ocean carbon uptake and associated acidification.

This disparity is particularly apparent in the eastern Pacific oxygen minimum zone, where some CMIP5 models showed increasing trends whereas observations show a strong decrease (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cabr%C3%A9--2015">Cabré et al., 2015</a>). However, proxy reconstructions suggest that over the last century the ocean may have in fact undergone increases in oxygen in the most oxygen poor regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Deutsch--2014">Deutsch et al., 2014</a>).

Variability and trends in the observed upper ocean oxygen concentration are mainly driven by the apparent oxygen utilization component with small contributions from oxygen solubility, suggesting that changing ocean circulation, mixing, and/or biochemical processes, rather than thermally induced solubility effects may be the main drivers of observed deoxygenation. The spatial distribution of the ocean deoxygenation in the interior of the ocean as well as over coastal areas is further assessed in Section 5.3.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.6.2_p4">As one of the most commonly observed surface parameters, the partial pressure of CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> has been the topic of considerable detection and attribution work.

Consequently, conflicting results emerge in the attribution of reconstructed long-term variations in the NAO to solar forcing, whose influence thus remains controversial (<a class="reference-link" href="#G%C3%B3mez-Navarro--2013">Gómez-Navarro and Zorita, 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Moffa-S%C3%A1nchez--2014">Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ortega--2015">Ortega et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ait%20Brahim--2018">Ait Brahim et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sjolte--2018">Sjolte et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Xu--2018">Xu et al., 2018</a>).

In addition to this ENSO event diversity, the short observational record also displays an increase in the number of the Central Pacific-type events in recent decades (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ashok--2007">Ashok et al., 2007</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McPhaden--2011">McPhaden et al., 2011</a>), which has also been identified as unusual in the context of the last 500–800 years based on recent paleo-climatic reconstructions (<a class="section-link" data-title="El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.4.2">Section 2.4.2</a>; Y. <a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2017"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2017">Liu et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Freund--2019">Freund et al., 2019</a>).

Initial analysis with a selected number of CMIP3 models suggested that there may be a forced component to this recent prominence of Central Pacific-type events (<a class="reference-link" href="#Yeh--2009">Yeh et al., 2009</a>), but analysis since then suggests that this behaviour is (i) consistent with that expected from internal variability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Newman--2011">Newman et al., 2011</a>); and (ii) not apparent across the full CMIP5 ensemble of historical simulations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Taschetto--2014">Taschetto et al., 2014</a>). Analysis of single-model large ensembles suggests that changes to ENSO event type in response to historical radiative forcing are not significant (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Stevenson--2019">Stevenson et al., 2019</a>). These same results, however, also suggest that multiple forcings can have significant influences on ENSO type and that the net response will depend on the accurate representation of the balance of these forcings (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stevenson--2019">Stevenson et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.7.3_p10">The climatic effects of ENSO outside the tropical Pacific largely arise through atmospheric teleconnections that are induced by ENSO-driven changes in deep tropical atmospheric convection and heating (<a class="reference-link" href="#Yeh--2018">Yeh et al., 2018</a>). The teleconnections to higher latitudes are forced by waves that propagate into the extratropics (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hoskins--1981">Hoskins and Karoly, 1981</a>) and respectively excite the Pacific-North American pattern (<a class="reference-link" href="#Horel--1981">Horel and Wallace, 1981</a>) and Pacific-South American pattern (<a class="reference-link" href="#Karoly--1989">Karoly, 1989</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Irving--2016">Irving and Simmonds, 2016</a>) in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Given the influence of these teleconnections on climate and extremes around the globe, it is important to understand how well they are reproduced in CMIP models. What has also become clear is that spatial correlations of ENSO’s teleconnections calculated over relatively short periods (&lt;100 years) may not be the most effective way to assess these relationships (<a class="reference-link" href="#Langenbrunner--2013">Langenbrunner and Neelin, 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Perry--2020">Perry et al., 2020</a>).

However, looking at simplified metrics like the agreement in the sign of the teleconnections (<a class="reference-link" href="#Langenbrunner--2013">Langenbrunner and Neelin, 2013</a>), regional average teleconnection strength over land (<a class="reference-link" href="#Perry--2020">Perry et al., 2020</a>), or a combination of both (<a class="reference-link" href="#Power--2018">Power and Delage, 2018</a>) provides a more robust depiction of the teleconnection representation. Examining sign agreement for the teleconnection patterns, ensembles of CMIP5 AMIP simulations display broad spatial regions with high sign agreement with the observations, suggesting that the model ensemble is producing useful information regarding the teleconnected precipitation signal (<a class="reference-link" href="#Langenbrunner--2013">Langenbrunner and Neelin, 2013</a>). Looking at regional averages of CMIP5 historical simulations, <a class="reference-link" href="#Power--2018">Power and Delage (2018)</a> show that the average coupled model teleconnection pattern reproduces the sign of the observed teleconnections in the majority of the 25 regions analysed. The sign agreement between the observed teleconnection and the multi-model mean teleconnection remains strong in CMIP6 (18 out of 20 displayed regions; Figure 3.38), and the observed DJF (December–January–February) teleconnection strength falls within the modelled range in all of the displayed regions for temperature and precipitation.

The atmospheric Bjerknes feedback is too weak in the majority of models, while the surface heat flux feedback is also too weak in the majority of models. The former restricts event growth, while the latter restricts event damping, which when combined allow most models to produce variability in a range that is consistent with the observations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bellenger--2014">Bellenger et al., 2014</a>; S.T. <a class="reference-link" href="#Kim--2014"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Kim--2014">Kim et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Vijayeta--2018">Vijayeta and Dommenget, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bayr--2019">Bayr et al., 2019</a>).

Many studies find that the broad spatial characteristics of PDV are reasonably well represented in unforced climate models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Newman--2016">Newman et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Henley--2017">Henley, 2017</a>) and in historical simulations in CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Figure 3.39), although there is sensitivity to the methodology used to remove the externally-forced component of the SST (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bonfils--2011">Bonfils and Santer, 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Xu--2018">Xu and Hu, 2018</a>). Compared with CMIP3 models, CMIP5 models exhibit overall slightly better performance in reproducing PDV and associated teleconnections (<a class="reference-link" href="#Polade--2013">Polade et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Joshi--2017">Joshi and Kucharski, 2017</a>), and also smaller inter-model spread (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lyu--2016">Lyu et al., 2016</a>). CMIP6 models on average show slightly improved reproduction of the PDV spatial structure than CMIP5 models (Figure 3.39a–c; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fasullo--2020">Fasullo et al., 2020</a>). SST anomalies in the subtropical South Pacific lobe are, however, too weak relative to the equatorial and North Pacific lobes in CMIP5 pre-industrial control and historical simulations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Henley--2017">Henley et al., 2017</a>), a bias that remains in CMIP6 (Figure 3.39b).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.7.6_p4">Biases in the PDV temporal properties and amplitude are present in CMIP5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cheung--2017">Cheung et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Henley--2017">Henley, 2017</a>). While model evaluation is severely hampered by short observational records and incomplete observational coverage before satellite measurements started, the duration of PDV phases appears to be shorter in coupled models than in observations, and correspondingly the ratio of decadal to interannual variance is underestimated (Figure 3.39e,f; <a class="reference-link" href="#Henley--2017">Henley et al., 2017</a>). This apparent bias may be associated with overly biennial behaviour of Pacific trade wind variability and related ENSO activity, leaving too weak variability on decadal time scales (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kociuba--2015">Kociuba and Power, 2015</a>). ENSO influence on the extratropical North Pacific Ocean at decadal time scales is also very diverse among both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models, being controlled by multiple factors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nidheesh--2017">Nidheesh et al., 2017</a>). In terms of amplitude, the variance of the PDV index after decadal filtering is significantly weaker in the concatenated CMIP5 ensemble than the three observational estimates used in Figure 3.39e (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">p</i>&lt;0.1 with an F-test). Consequently, the observed PDV fluctuations over the historical period often lie in the tails of the model distributions (Figure 3.39e,f). Even if one cannot rule out that the observed PDV over the instrumental era represents an exceptional period of variability, it is plausible that the tendency of the CMIP5 models to systematically underestimate the low frequency variance is due to an incomplete representation of decadal-scale mechanisms in these models. This situation is slightly improved in CMIP6 historical simulations but remains a concern (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fasullo--2020">Fasullo et al., 2020</a>). The results of <a class="reference-link" href="#McGregor--2018">McGregor et al. (2018)</a> suggest that the under-representation of the variability stems from Atlantic mean SST biases (<a class="section-link" data-title="Tropical Atlantic Ocean" href="#3.5.1.2.2">Section 3.5.1.2.2</a>) through inter-basin coupling.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.7.6_p5">While PDV is primarily understood as an internal mode of variability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Si--2017">Si and Hu, 2017</a>), there are some indications that anthropogenically induced SST changes project onto PDV and have contributed to its past evolution (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bonfils--2011">Bonfils and Santer, 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dong--2014a">Dong et al., 2014a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Boo--2015">Boo et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Xu--2018">Xu and Hu, 2018</a>). However, the level of evidence is <i class="•-Condensed-italic">limited</i> because of the difficulty in correctly separating internal versus externally forced components of the observed SST variations, and because it is unclear whether the dynamics of the PDV are operative in this forced SST change pattern. Over the last two to three decades which encompass the period of slower GMST increase (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1), <a class="reference-link" href="#Smith--2016">Smith et al. (2016)</a> found that anthropogenic aerosols have driven part of the PDV change toward its negative phase. A similar result is shown in <a class="reference-link" href="#Takahashi--2016">Takahashi and Watanabe (2016)</a> who found intensification of the Pacific Walker circulation in response to aerosol forcing (<a class="section-link" data-title="Walker circulation strength" href="#3.3.3.1.2">Section 3.3.3.1.2</a>). Indeed, CMIP6 models simulate a negative PDV trend since the 1980s (Figure 3.39f), which is much weaker than internal variability. However, a response to anthropogenic aerosols is not robustly identified in a large ensemble of a model (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oudar--2018">Oudar et al., 2018</a>), across CMIP5 models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hua--2018">Hua et al., 2018</a>), or in idealized model simulations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kuntz--2016">Kuntz and Schrag, 2016</a>). Alternatively, inter-basin teleconnections associated with the warming of the North Atlantic Ocean related to the mid-1990s phase shift of the AMV (<a class="reference-link" href="#McGregor--2014">McGregor et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chikamoto--2016">Chikamoto et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kucharski--2016">Kucharski et al., 2016</a>; X. <a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2016"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2016">Li et al., 2016</a>a; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ruprich-Robert--2017">Ruprich-Robert et al., 2017</a>), and also warming in the Indian Ocean (<a class="reference-link" href="#Luo--2012">Luo et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mochizuki--2016">Mochizuki et al., 2016</a>), could have favoured a PDV transition to its negative phase in the 2000s. Considering the possible influence of external forcing on Indian Ocean decadal variability (<a class="section-link" data-title="Indian Ocean Basin and Dipole Modes" href="#3.7.4">Section 3.7.4</a>) and AMV (<a class="section-link" data-title="Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability" href="#3.7.7">Section 3.7.7</a>), any such human influence on PDV would be indirect through changes in these ocean basins, and then imported to the Pacific via inter-basin coupling. However, this human influence on AMV, and how consistently such inter-basin processes affect PDV phase shifts, are uncertain. Other modelling studies find that anthropogenic aerosols can influence the PDV (<a class="reference-link" href="#Verma--2019">Verma et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Amiri-Farahani--2020">Amiri-Farahani et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dow--2020">Dow et al., 2020</a>). It is however unclear whether and how much those forcings contributed to the observed variations of PDV. In CMIP6 models, the temporal correlation of the multi-model ensemble mean PDV index with its observational counterpart is insignificant and negligible (Figure 3.39f), suggesting that any externally-driven component in historical PDV variations was weak. Lastly, the multi-model ensemble mean computed from CMIP6 historical simulations shows slightly stronger variation than the CMIP5 counterpart, suggesting a greater simulated influence from external forcings in CMIP6. Still, the fraction of the forced signal to the total PDV is very low (Figure 3.39f), in contrast to AMV (<a class="section-link" data-title="Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability" href="#3.7.7">Section 3.7.7</a>). Consistently, <a class="reference-link" href="#Liguori--2020">Liguori et al. (2020)</a> estimate that the variance fraction of the externally-driven to total PDV is up to only 15% in a multi-model large ensemble of historical simulations. These findings support an assessment that PDV is mostly driven by internal variability since the pre-industrial era. The sensitivity of ensemble-mean PDV trends to the ensemble size (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oudar--2018">Oudar et al., 2018</a>), and the dominance of the ensemble spread over the ensemble mean in the 60-year trend of the equatorial Pacific zonal SST gradient in large ensemble simulations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Watanabe--2021">Watanabe et al., 2021</a>), also support this statement.</p><div class="•-2-columns" id="_idContainer088"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-42" id="figure-3-39" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_3_39.png"></span></strong><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title">Figure 3.39 | </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Model evaluation of the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV).

The AR5 found only modest improvement regarding the simulation of climate for two periods of the Earth’s history (the Last Glacial Maximum and the mid-Holocene) between CMIP5 and previous paleoclimate simulations. Similarly, for the modern period only modest, incremental progress was found between CMIP3 and CMIP5 regarding the simulation of precipitation and radiation.

The multi-variate evaluation of these three generations of models is performed relative to the observational datasets listed in Annex I, Table AI.1. For many of these datasets, a rigorous characterization of the observational uncertainty is not available, see discussion in Chapter 2. Here, as much as possible, multiple independent observational datasets are used. Disagreements among them would cause differences in model scoring, indicating that observational uncertainties may be substantial compared to model errors. Conversely, similar scores against different observational datasets would suggest model biases may be larger than the observational uncertainty.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.8.2.1_p4">An analysis of a basket of 16 atmospheric variables (Figure 3.42a) assessed across CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6 models but excluding high-resolution models participating in HighResMIP, reveals the progress made between these three generations of models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bock--2020">Bock et al., 2020</a>). Progress is evidenced by the increasing prevalence of blue colours (indicating a performance better than the median) for the more recent model versions. Additionally, a few CMIP6 models outperform the best-performing CMIP5 models. Progress is evident across all 16 variables. As noted in AR5, the models typically score similarly against both observational reference datasets, indicating that indeed uncertainties in these reference datasets are smaller than model biases. Several models and model families perform better compared to observational references than the median, across a majority of the climate variables assessed, and conversely some other models or model families compare more poorly against these reference datasets. Such a good correspondence across a range of diagnostic fields probing different aspects of climate enhances confidence that the improved performances reflect progress in the physical realism of these simulations. An alternative explanation, that progress is due to a cancellation of errors achieved by model tuning, appears improbable given the large number of diagnostic fields involved here. However, several instances of poor model performance (red colours in Figure 3.42) still exist in the CMIP6 ensemble. Family relationships (i.e. various degrees of shared formulations; <a class="reference-link" href="#Knutti--2013">Knutti et al., 2013</a>) between the models are apparent, for example, the GISS, GFDL, CESM, CNRM, and HadGEM/UKESM1/ACCESS families score similarly across all atmospheric variables, both for the CMIP5 and CMIP6 generations.

Little further progress between CMIP3 and CMIP5 was found for fields that were already quite well simulated in CMIP3 (such as surface air temperature and outgoing longwave radiation). For precipitation, the spread reduced because the worst-performing models improved. The shortwave cloud radiative effect remained relatively poorly simulated with significant inter-model spread (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Calisto--2014">Calisto et al., 2014</a>). This comparison of centred pattern correlations is designed to help determine the quality of simulation of different diagnostics relative to each other, and also to examine progress between generations of models. Figure 3.43 shows the centred pattern correlations for 16 variables for CMIP3, CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. In the ensemble averages, CMIP6 performs better than CMIP5 and CMIP3 for near-surface temperature, precipitation, mean sea-level pressure, and many other variables. For the variables shown, the uncertainties in observational datasets, in particular for precipitation and northward wind at 850 hPa, remain substantial relative to mean model errors (see grey dots in Figure 3.43).</p><div class="•-2-columns" id="_idContainer096"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-45" id="figure-3-43" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_3_43.png">Figure 3.43 | </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Centred pattern correlations between models and observations for the annual mean climatology over the period 1980–1999. </span>Results are shown for individual CMIP3 (green), CMIP5 (blue) and CMIP6 (red) models (one ensemble member from each model is used) as short lines, along with the corresponding multi-model ensemble averages (long lines).

These time periods provide an out-of-sample test of models because they are not in general used in the process of model development. They encompass a range of climate drivers, such as volcanic and solar forcing for the Last Millennium, orbital forcing for the mid-Holocene and Last Interglacial, and changes in greenhouse gases and ice sheets for the LGM, mid-Pliocene Warm Period, and early Eocene (Sections 2.2 and 2.3). These drivers led to climate changes, including in surface temperature (<a class="section-link" data-title="Surface Temperatures" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.1.1">Section 2.3.1.1</a>) and the hydrological cycle (<a class="section-link" data-title="Paleo perspective of the global hydrological cycle" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.1.3.1">Section 2.3.1.3.1</a>), which are described by paleoclimate proxies that have been synthesized to support evaluations of models on a global and regional scale. However, the more sparse, indirect, and regionally incomplete climate information available from paleo-archives motivates a different form of the multivariate analysis of simulations covering these periods versus the equivalent for the historical period, as described below.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.8.2.1_p11">AR5 found that reconstructions and simulations of past climates both show similar responses in terms of large-scale patterns of climate change, such as polar amplification (<a class="reference-link" href="#Flato--2013">Flato et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Masson-Delmotte--2013">Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013</a>). However, for several regional signals (e.g., the north–south temperature gradient in Europe and regional precipitation changes), the magnitude of change seen in the proxies relative to the pre-industrial period was underestimated by the models. When benchmarking CMIP5/PMIP3 models against reconstructions of the mid-Holocene and LGM, AR5 found only a slight improvement compared with earlier model versions across a range of variables. For the Last Interglacial, it was noted that the magnitude of observed annual mean warming in the Northern Hemisphere was only reached in summer in the models. For the mid-Pliocene Warm Period, it was noted that both proxies and models showed a polar amplification of temperature compared with the pre-industrial period, but a formal model evaluation was not carried out.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.8.2.1_p12">Since AR5, new simulation protocols have been developed in PMIP4 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kageyama--2018">Kageyama et al., 2018</a>), which are further described for the mid-Holocene and the Last Interglacial by <a class="reference-link" href="#Otto-Bliesner--2017">Otto-Bliesner et al.

Those time periods for which the multi-model ensemble mean is outside the assessed range of GSAT, the mid-Holocene and the Last Interglacial, are primarily forced by orbital changes not greenhouse gas forcing, and as a result the forcing as well as the assessed and modelled response are relatively close to zero in the global annual mean.

Here we focus on the mid-Holocene and the LGM, which have been a part of AMIP or CMIP through several assessment cycles, and as such serve as a reference to quantify regional model-data agreement from one IPCC assessment to another. We compare the results from 15 CMIP6 models using the PMIP4 protocol (CMIP6-PMIP4), with non-CMIP6 models using the PMIP4 protocol, with PMIP3 models, and with regional temperature and precipitation changes from proxies for the mid-Holocene (Figure 3.44b). For six out of seven variables shown, the CMIP6 multi-model mean captures the correct sign of the change. For five out of seven of them the CMIP6 ensemble mean is within the reconstructed range. For the other two variables (changes in the mean temperature of the warmest month over North America and in the mean annual precipitation over West Africa) nearly all PMIP4 and PMIP3 models are outside the reconstructed range. CMIP6 models show regional patterns of temperature changes similar to the PMIP3 ensemble (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brierley--2020">Brierley et al., 2020</a>), but the slight mid-Holocene cooling in PMIP4 compared with PMIP3, probably associated with lower imposed mid-Holocene carbon dioxide concentrations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Otto-Bliesner--2017">Otto-Bliesner et al., 2017</a>), improves the regional model performance for summer and winter temperatures (Figure 3.44b). However, this cooling also results in a CMIP6 mid-Holocene GSAT that lies further from the assessed range (Figure 3.44a). All models show an expansion of the monsoon areas from the pre-industrial to the mid-Holocene simulations in the Northern Hemisphere, but this expansion in some cases is only large enough to cancel out the bias in the pre-industrial control simulations (<a class="section-link" data-title="Global Monsoon" href="#3.3.3.2">Section 3.3.3.2</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Brierley--2020">Brierley et al., 2020</a>). There is a slight improvement in representing the northward expansion of the West African monsoon region in PMIP4 compared with PMIP3 (Figures 3.11 and 3.44b).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.8.2.1_p15">Fourteen simulations of the LGM climate have been produced following the CMIP6-PMIP4 protocol using 11 models, five of which are from the latest CMIP6 generation. The multi-model-mean global cooling simulated by these models is close to that simulated by the CMIP5-PMIP3 ensemble, but the range of results is larger. The increase in the range is largely due to the inclusion of CESM2 which simulates a much larger cooling than the other PMIP4 models (Figure 3.44a). This is consistent with its larger climate sensitivity (see also (<a class="section-link" data-title="Surface Temperature" href="#3.3.1.1">Section 3.3.1.1</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhu--2021">Zhu et al., 2021</a>). The other models on average also simulate slightly larger cooling in PMIP4 versus PMIP3 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kageyama--2017">Kageyama et al., 2017</a>, 2021a). The PMIP4 multi-model mean is within the range of reconstructed regional averages for four out of seven regional variables; this is unchanged from PMIP3 but for different variables (Figure 3.44c). For all fields, the results of many individual models are outside the reconstructed range. For two variables out of seven (changes in the mean temperature of the warmest month and mean annual precipitation over Western Europe) no model is within the range of the reconstructions. This analysis is strengthened compared with the equivalent analysis in AR5 because it is based on larger and improved reconstructions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cleator--2020">Cleator et al., 2020</a>). Most CMIP6-PMIP4 models simulate a slightly stronger AMOC in the LGM, but no strong deepening of the AMOC (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kageyama--2021a">Kageyama et al., 2021a</a>), while most other PMIP4 models simulate a strengthening and strong deepening of the AMOC, as was the case for the PMIP3 models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Muglia--2015">Muglia and Schmittner, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sherriff-Tadano--2018">Sherriff-Tadano et al., 2018</a>).

The comparison to reconstructions is generally good, except for some discrepancies, such as for upwelling systems in the South East Atlantic or discrepancies which may result from local melting of remnant ice sheets absent in the Last Interglacial simulation protocol. All models simulate a decrease in Arctic sea ice in summer, commensurate with increased summer insolation, while some models even simulate a large or complete loss (<a class="reference-link" href="#Guarino--2020">Guarino et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kageyama--2021b">Kageyama et al., 2021b</a>).

However, there is also evidence of improvements in the frequency, distribution and interannual variability of tropical cyclones in HighResMIP (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2020a">Roberts et al., 2020a</a>, b), particularly in the Northern Hemisphere (see further discussion in Section 11.7.1.3), and their interaction with the ocean (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scoccimarro--2017">Scoccimarro et al., 2017</a>, single model), as well as the global moisture budget (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vanni%C3%A8re--2019">Vannière et al., 2019</a>).

In addition to increased process realism, the level of coupling between the physical climate and biogeochemical components of the Earth system has also been enhanced in some models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mulcahy--2020">Mulcahy et al., 2020</a>) as well as across different biogeochemical components (see Section 5.4 for a discussion and Table 5.4 for an overview).

A number of developments also explicitly target improved simulation of the past.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="3.8.2.2_p7">Further such ESM developments include: (i) Apart from the nitrogen cycle, extending terrestrial carbon cycle models to simulate interactions between the carbon cycle and other nutrient cycles, such as phosphorus, that are known to play an important role in limiting future plant uptake of CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zaehle--2015">Zaehle et al., 2015</a>).

Furthermore, interactive treatment of atmospheric chemistry in a full ESM supports investigation of interactions between climate and air quality mitigation efforts, such as in AerChemMIP (<a class="reference-link" href="#Collins--2017">Collins et al., 2017</a>), as well as interactions between stratospheric ozone recovery and global warming (<a class="reference-link" href="#Morgenstern--2018">Morgenstern et al., 2018</a>). (iii) Coupling between components of Earth system models has been extended to increase their utility for studying future interactions across the full Earth system, such as between ocean biogeochemistry and cloud-aerosol processes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mulcahy--2020">Mulcahy et al., 2020</a>), and vegetation and impacts on dust production (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kok--2018">Kok et al., 2018</a>), production of secondary organic aerosols (SOA, <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhao--2017">Zhao et al., 2017</a>) and Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), whereby enhanced CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> fertilization of land vegetation causes changes in regional surface albedo (<a class="reference-link" href="#Andrews--2019">Andrews et al., 2019</a>). Increased coupling between physical climate and biogeochemical processes in a single ESM, along with an increased number of interactively represented processes, such as permafrost thaw, vegetation, wildfires and continental ice sheets increases our ability to investigate the potential for abrupt and interactive changes in the Earth system (see Sections 4.7.3 and 5.4.9, and Box 5.1).

In comparison with standard resolution CMIP6 models, higher resolution probed under the HighResMIP activity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Haarsma--2016">Haarsma et al., 2016</a>) improves aspects of the simulation of climate (particularly concerning sea surface temperature) but discrepancies remain and there are some regions, such as parts of the Southern Ocean, where currently attainable resolution produces inferior performance (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>). Such model behaviour can indicate deficiencies in model physics that are not simply associated with resolution. In several cases, high-complexity ESMs that include additional interactions between Earth system components and thus have potential for additional associated model errors nevertheless perform as well as their low-complexity counterparts, illustrating that interactively simulating these Earth System components as part of the climate system is now well established.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="acknowledgements"><h1 class="unnumbered">Acknowledgements</h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-10-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Graphic developers: Bettina K.

This conclusion is based on a synthesis of information from multiple lines of evidence, including direct observations of recent changes in Earth’s climate; analyses of tree rings, ice cores, and other long-term records documenting how the climate has changed in the past; and computer simulations based on the fundamental physics that governs the climate system.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Climate is influenced by a range of factors. There are two main natural drivers of variations in climate on time scales of decades to centuries. The first is variations in the sun’s activity, which alter the amount of incoming energy from the sun. The second is large volcanic eruptions, which increase the number of small particles (aerosols) in the upper atmosphere that reflect sunlight and cool the surface–an effect that can last for several years (see also FAQ 3.2). The main human drivers of climate change are increases in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and of aerosols from burning fossil fuels, land use and other sources. The greenhouse gases trap infrared radiation near the surface, warming the climate. Aerosols, like those produced naturally by volcanoes, on average cool the climate by increasing the reflection of sunlight. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that human drivers are the main cause of recent climate change.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">The current rates of increase of the concentration of the major greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years. Several lines of evidence clearly show that these increases are the results of human activities. The basic physics underlying the warming effect of greenhouse gases on the climate has been understood for more than a century, and our current understanding has been used to develop the latest generation climate models (see FAQ 3.3). Like weather forecasting models, climate models represent the state of the atmosphere on a grid and simulate its evolution over time based on physical principles. They include a representation of the ocean, sea ice and the main processes important in driving climate and climate change.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Results consistently show that such climate models can only reproduce the observed warming (black line in FAQ 3.1, Figure 1) when including the effects of human activities (grey band in FAQ 3.1, Figure 1), in particular the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. These climate models show a dominant warming effect of greenhouse gas increases (red band, which shows the warming effects of greenhouse gases by themselves), which has been partly offset by the cooling effect of increases in atmospheric aerosols (blue band). By contrast, simulations that include only natural processes, including internal variability related to El Niño and other similar variations, as well as variations in the activity of the sun and emissions from large volcanoes (green band in FAQ 3.1, Figure 1), are not able to reproduce the observed warming. The fact that simulations including only natural processes show much smaller temperature increases indicates that natural processes alone cannot explain the strong rate of warming observed. The observed rate can only be reproduced when human influence is added to the simulations.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Moreover, the dominant effect of human activities is apparent not only in the warming of global surface temperature, but also in the pattern of warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere, warming of the ocean, melting of sea ice, and many other observed changes. An additional line of evidence for the role of humans in driving climate change comes from comparing the rate of warming observed over recent decades with that which occurred prior to human influence on climate. Evidence from tree rings and other paleoclimate records shows that the rate of increase of global surface temperature observed over the past fifty years exceeded that which occurred in any previous 50-year period over the past 2000 years (see FAQ 2.1).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">Taken together, this evidence shows that humans are the dominant cause of observed global warming over recent decades.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body faq-fix" lang="en-US"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" id="faq-3-1-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_3_1_Figure_1.png"></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title">FAQ 3.1, Figure 1 | </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Observed warming (1850–2019) is only reproduced in simulations including human influence. </span>Global surface temperature changes in observations, compared to climate model simulations of the response to all human and natural forcings (grey band), greenhouse gases only (red band), aerosols and other human drivers only (blue band) and natural forcings only (green band).

It includes variability that is internally generated within the climate system and variability that is driven by natural external factors. Natural variability is a major cause of year-to-year changes in global surface climate and can play a prominent role in trends over multiple years or even decades. But the influence of natural variability is typically small when considering trends over periods of multiple decades or longer. When estimated over the entire historical period (1850–2020), the contribution of natural variability to global surface warming of –0.23°C to +0.23°C is small compared to the warming of about 1.1°C observed during the same period, which has been almost entirely attributed to the human influence.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Paleoclimatic records (indirect measurements of climate that can extend back many thousands of years) and climate models all show that global surface temperatures have changed significantly over a wide range of time scales in the past. One of these reasons is <span class="•-Italic">natural variability</span>, which refers to variations in climate that are either <span class="•-Italic">internally</span> generated within the climate system or <span class="•-Italic">externally</span> driven by natural changes. Internal natural variability corresponds to a redistribution of energy within the climate system (for example via atmospheric circulation <span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic"></span> changes similar to those that drive the daily weather) and is most clearly observed as regional, rather than global, fluctuations in surface temperature. External natural variability can result from changes in the Earth’s orbit, small variations in energy received from the sun, or from major volcanic eruptions. Although large orbital changes are related to global climate changes of the past, they operate on very long time scales (i.e., thousands of years). As such, they have displayed very little change over the past century and have had very little influence on temperature changes observed over that period. On the other hand, volcanic eruptions can strongly cool the Earth, but this effect is short-lived and their influence on surface temperatures typically fades within a decade of the eruption.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">To understand how much of observed recent climate change has been caused by natural variability (a process referred to as attribution), scientists use climate model simulations. When only natural factors are used to force climate models, the resulting simulations show variations in climate on a wide range of time scales in response to volcanic eruptions, variations in solar activity, and internal natural variability. However, the influence of natural climate variability typically decreases as the time period gets longer, such that it only has mild effects on multi-decadal and longer trends (FAQ 3.2, Figure 1).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Consequently, over periods of a couple of decades or less, natural climate variability can dominate the human-induced surface warming trend – leading to periods with stronger or weaker warming, and sometimes even cooling (FAQ 3.2, Figure 1, left and centre). Over longer periods, however, the effect of natural variability is relatively small (FAQ 3.2, Figure 1, right). For instance, over the entire historical period (1850–2019), natural variability is estimated to have caused between –0.23°C and +0.23°C of the observed surface warming of about 1.1°C. This means that the bulk of the warming has been almost entirely attributed to human activities, particularly emissions of greenhouse gases (FAQ 3.1).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">Another way to picture natural variability and human influence is to think of a person walking a dog. The path of the walker represents the human-induced warming, while their dog represents natural variability. Looking at global surface temperature changes over short periods is akin to focusing on the dog. The dog sometimes moves ahead of the owner and other times behind. This is similar to natural variability that can weaken or amplify warming on the short term. In both cases it is difficult to predict where the dog will be or how the climate will evolve in the near future. However, if we pull back and focus on the slow steady steps of the owner, the path of the dog is much clearer and more predictable, as it follows the path of its owner. Similarly, human influence on the climate is much clearer over longer time periods.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" id="faq-3-2-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_3_2_Figure_1.png"></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title">FAQ 3.2, Figure 1 | </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Annual (left), decadal (middle) and multi-decadal (right) variations in average global surface temperature. </span> The thick black line is an estimate of the human contribution to temperature changes, based on climate models, whereas the green lines show the combined effect of natural variations and human-induced warming, different shadings of green represent different simulations, which can be viewed as showing a range of potential pasts.

This improvement can be measured by comparing climate simulations against historical observations. Both the current and previous generations of models show that increases in greenhouse gases cause global warming. While past warming is well simulated by the new generation models as a group, some individual models simulate past warming that is either below or above what is observed. The information about how well models simulate past warming, as well as other insights from observations and theory, are used to refine this Report’s projections of global warming.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Climate models are important tools for understanding past, present and future climate change. They are sophisticated computer programs that are based on fundamental laws of physics of the atmosphere, ocean, ice, and land. Climate models perform their calculations on a three-dimensional grid made of small bricks or ‘gridcells’ of about 100 km across. Processes that occur on scales smaller than the model grid cells (such as the transformation of cloud moisture into rain) are treated in a simplified way. This simplification is done differently in different models. Some models include more processes and complexity than others; some represent processes in finer detail (smaller grid cells) than others. Hence the simulated climate and climate change vary between models.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Climate modelling started in the 1950s and, over the years, models have become increasingly sophisticated as computing power, observations and our understanding of the climate system have advanced. The models used in the IPCC First Assessment Report published in 1990 correctly reproduced many aspects of climate (FAQ 1.1). The actual evolution of the climate since then has confirmed these early projections, when accounting for the differences between the simulated scenarios and actual emissions. Models continue to improve and get better and better at simulating the large variety of important processes that affect climate. For example, many models now simulate complex interactions between different aspects of the Earth system, such as the uptake of carbon dioxide by vegetation on land and by the ocean, and the interaction between clouds and air pollutants. While some models are becoming more comprehensive, others are striving to represent processes at higher resolution, for example to better represent the vortices and swirls in currents responsible for much of the transport of heat in the ocean.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Scientists evaluate the performance of climate models by comparing historical climate model simulations to observations. This evaluation includes comparison of large-scale averages as well as more detailed regional and seasonal variations. There are two important aspects to consider: (i) how models perform individually and (ii) how they perform as a group. The average of many models often compares better against observations than any individual model, since errors in representing detailed processes tend to cancel each other out in multi-model averages.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">As an example, FAQ 3.3 Figure 1 compares simulations from the three most recent generations of models (available around 2008, 2013 and 2021) with observations of three climate variables. It shows the correlation between simulated and observed patterns, where a value of 1 represents perfect agreement. Many individual models of the new generation perform significantly better, as indicated by values closer to 1. As a group, each generation out-performs the previous generation: the multi-model average (shown by the longer lines) is progressively closer to 1. The vertical extent of the colored bars indicates the range of model performance across each group. The top of the bar moves up with each generation, indicating improved performance of the best performing models from one generation to the next. In the case of precipitation, the performance of the worst performing models is similar in the two most recent model generations, increasing the spread across models.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">Developments in the latest generation of climate models, including new and better representation of physical, chemical and biological processes, as well as higher resolution, have improved the simulation of many aspects of the Earth system.
