It complements material in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 on observed and projected changes in the water cycle, and Chapters 10 and 11 on regional climate change and extreme events. The assessment includes the physical basis for water cycle changes, observed changes in the water cycle and attribution of their causes, future projections and related key uncertainties, and the potential for abrupt change. Paleoclimate evidence, observations, reanalyses and global and regional model simulations are considered. The assessment shows widespread, non-uniform human-caused alterations of the water cycle, which have been obscured by a competition between different drivers across the 20th century and that will be increasingly dominated by greenhouse gas forcing at the global scale.</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="Physical"><h2 class="unnumbered" lang="de-DE">Physical Basis for Water Cycle Changes<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-1-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Modifications of Earth’s energy budget by anthropogenic radiative forcings drive substantial and widespread changes in the global water cycle</span>.

Freshwater supports a range of human activities from irrigation to industrial processes including the generation of hydro-electricity and the cooling of thermoelectric power plants (Bates et al., 2008; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schewe--2014">Schewe et al., 2014</a>). These activities require sufficient quantities of freshwater that can be drawn from rivers, lakes, groundwater stores, and in some cases, desalinated sea water (Schewe et al., 2014). Recent estimates of global water pools and fluxes suggest that half of global river discharge is redistributed each year by human water use (Abbott et al., 2019). This emphasizes the need to consider both anthropogenic climate change and direct human influences, such as population increase or migration, economic development, urbanization, and land use change, when planning water-related mitigation or adaptation strategies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jim%C3%A9nez%20Cisneros--2014">Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Water scarcity occurs when there are insufficient freshwater resources to meet water demands, although water problems may also arise from water quality issues or from economic and institutional barriers (AR6 WGII Chapter 4).

As such, water availability is a major constraint on human society’s ability to meet the future food and energy needs of a growing population (D’Odorico et al., 2018). Water plays a key role in the production of energy, including hydro-electricity, bioenergy, and the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels (Schewe et al., 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#D%E2%80%99Odorico--2018">D’Odorico et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Djehdian--2019">Djehdian et al., 2019</a>). These dependencies have resulted in increasing competition for water between the food and energy sectors. Pressures on this ‘food-energy-water nexus’ are further compounded by increasing globalization, which can transfer large-scale water demands to other regions of the world, raising serious concerns about local food and water security in regions that are highly dependent on agricultural exports or imports (D’Odorico et al., 2018).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The consequences of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and human societies are primarily experienced through changes to the global water cycle (JiménezCisneros et al., 2014). Changes in the quantity and seasonality of water due to climate change have long been recognized by IPCC and global development agencies as heavily influencing the food security and economic prosperity of many countries, particularly in the arid and semi-arid areas of the world including Asia, Africa, Australia, Latin America, the Mediterranean, and small island developing states (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bates--2008">Bates et al., 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schewe--2014">Schewe et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mekonnen--2016">Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016</a>).

Climate change poses a threat to both regional water availability and global water security. Changes in precipitation and glacier runoff and snowmelt influence other hydroclimate variables like surface and subsurface runoff, and groundwater recharge, which are critical to the water, food and energy security of many regions (Oki andKanae, 2006; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jim%C3%A9nez%20Cisneros--2014">Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schewe--2014">Schewe et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mekonnen--2016">Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Currently, around four billion people live under conditions of severe freshwater scarcity for at least one month of the year, with half a billion people in the world facing severe water scarcity all year round (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016).

The ocean is the primary water reservoir on Earth: it comprises mostly liquid water across much of the globe but also includes areas covered by ice in polar regions. Liquid freshwater on land forms surface water (lakes, rivers) and, together with soil moisture and mostly unusable groundwater stores, accounts for less than 2% of global water (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stocker--2013">Stocker et al., 2013</a>). Solid terrestrial water that occurs as ice sheets, glaciers, snow and ice on the surface, and permafrost currently represents nearly 2% of the planet’s water (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stocker--2013">Stocker et al., 2013</a>). Water that falls as snow in winter provides soil moisture and streamflow after melting, which are essential for human activities and ecosystem functioning. Note that these best estimates do not lead to a perfectly closed global water budget and that this budget has no reason to be closed given the ongoing human influence through both climate change (e.g., melting of ice sheets and glaciers, see Chapter 9) and water use (e.g., groundwater depletion through pumping into fossil aquifers, see Figure 8.10). </span></strong><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Understanding the interactions between the water and energy cycles is one of the four core projects of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). Latent heat fluxes, released by condensation of atmospheric water vapour and absorbed by evaporative processes, are critical to driving the circulation of the atmosphere on scales ranging from individual thunderstorm cells to the global circulation of the atmosphere (Stocker et al., 2013; <a class="reference-link" href="#Miralles--2019">Miralles et al., 2019</a>). Water vapour is the most important gaseous absorber in the Earth’s atmosphere, playing a key role in the Earth’s radiative budget (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schneider--2010">Schneider et al., 2010</a>).

High mountain regions have experienced significant warming since the early 20th century, resulting in reduced snowpack on average (Marty et al., 2017), with glaciers retreating globally since the mid-20th century (Marzeion et al., 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zemp--2019">Zemp et al., 2019</a>). Glacier shrinkage and snow cover changes have led to changes (both increases and decreases) in streamflow in many mountain regions in recent decades (Milner et al., 2017). Permafrost regions have undergone degradation and ground-ice loss due to recent warming (Lu et al., 2017). Glacier mass loss is projected to continue through the 21st century under all scenarios. In high mountain areas, low-elevation snow cover is also projected to decrease, regardless of emissions scenario. Widespread permafrost thaw is projected to continue through this century and beyond. River runoff in snow- or glacier-fed basins is projected to increase in winter and to decrease in summer (and in the annual mean) by 2100. In the oceans, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will <i class="•-Condensed-italic">very likely </i> weaken over the 21st century under all emissions scenarios (SROCC), with potential effects on atmospheric circulation and the water cycle at the regional scale (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="What Is the Potential for Abrupt Change?" href="#8.6">Section 8.6</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable management, food security, and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL) has clear connections with the water cycle.

Since AR5, longer and more homogeneous observational and reanalysis datasets have been produced along with new ensembles of historical simulations driven by all or individual anthropogenic forcings. These factors, together with improved detection-attribution tools, has enabled a more comprehensive assessment and a better understanding of recent observed water cycle changes, including the competing effects of GHGs and aerosol emissions. New paleoclimate reconstructions have been also developed, particularly from the SH, that were not available at the time of AR5. There have also been advances in modelling clouds, precipitation, surface fluxes, vegetation, snow, floodplains, groundwater and other processes relevant to the water cycle. Convection permitting and cloud-resolving models have been implemented over increasingly large domains and can be used as benchmarks for the evaluation of the current-generation climate models. The added value of increased resolution in global or regional climate models can be also assessed more thoroughly based on dedicated model intercomparison projects (Sections 10.3.3 and 8.5.1). Ongoing research activities on decadal predictions and observational constraints are aimed at narrowing the plausible range of near-term (2021<span class="CharOverride-6" lang="en-US">–</span>2040) to long-term (2081<span class="CharOverride-6" lang="en-US">–</span>2100) water cycle changes.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">This chapter assesses water cycle changes and considers climate change from the perspective of its effects on water availability (including streamflow and soil moisture, snow mass and glaciers, groundwater, wetlands and lakes) rather than only precipitation.

Anthropogenic drivers include not only emissions of GHGs but also different species of aerosols, land and water management practices. Emphasis is placed on assessing the full range of projections, including ‘low likelihood, high impact’ climate trajectories such as the potential for abrupt changes in the water cycle.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The chapter starts with theoretical evidence that link small-scale processes and drivers, as well as global energy budget and large-scale circulation constraints to physically-understood changes in the global water cycle (<a class="section-link" data-title="Why Should We Expect Water Cycle Changes?" href="#8.2">Section 8.2</a>). Observed and projected water cycle changes (Sections 8.3 and 8.4, respectively) are assessed in separate sections, but with a parallel structure to facilitate comparison of a specific topic across sections. Projections are primarily assessed on the basis of contrasted emissions scenarios to emphasize the water cycle response to mitigation. Unless otherwise specified, projected anomalies are estimated relative to the 1995<span class="CharOverride-6" lang="en-US">–</span>2014 baseline climatology and are assessed over 20-year time slices, 2021<span class="CharOverride-6" lang="en-US">–</span>2040, 2041<span class="CharOverride-6" lang="en-US">–</span>2060 and 2081<span class="CharOverride-6" lang="en-US">–</span>2100 for near-, mid- and long-term changes respectively.

Beyond global and regional mean precipitation amounts, <a class="section-link" data-title="Water Cycle Changes" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-8">Chapter 8</a> also focuses on other precipitation properties (e.g., frequency, intensity and seasonality) and other water cycle variables (evapotranspiration, runoff, soil moisture and aridity, solid and liquid freshwater reservoirs). Key regional phenomena (e.g., tropical overturning circulations, monsoons, extratropical stationary waves and storm tracks, modes of variability and related teleconnections) are also assessed given their major dynamical contribution to regional water cycle changes. Although the biosphere and the cryosphere are key components of the water cycle, a more comprehensive assessment of their responses can be found in Chapters 5 and 9, respectively. Further assessment on regional water cycle changes can be found in Chapters 10 to 12 and in the Atlas.

Fast atmospheric adjustments are caused by near-instantaneous (hours to days) changes in the atmospheric energy budget (Figure 8.3, panels 1–3) and atmospheric properties (e.g., temperature, clouds and water vapour) in direct response to the radiative effects of a forcing agent (Sherwoodet al., 2015).

Global mean precipitation increases after complete removal of present-day anthropogenic aerosol emissions (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Response to Short-lived Climate Forcers and Volcanic Eruptions" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4#4.4.4">Section 4.4.4</a>) in four different climate models (<span class="•-Greek-Italic">η</span><span class="•-Subscript-Italic _idGenCharOverride-2">a</span>= 1.6<span class="CharOverride-6" lang="en-US">–</span>5.5% °C<sup class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1">–1</sup>) are mainly attributed to sulphate aerosol as opposed to other aerosol species (<a class="reference-link" href="#Samset--2018b">Samset et al., 2018b</a>).

Also, since oceans supply much of the moisture to fuel precipitation over land, the slower ocean warming rate means there is insufficient moisture supplied to maintain continental relative humidity levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Byrne--2018">Byrne and O’Gorman, 2018</a>), which can inhibit convection (J. <a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2020"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2020">Chen et al., 2020</a>a).

There is medium understanding of how land–sea warming contrast governs rapid precipitation responses based on idealized modelling that shows similar spatial patterns of precipitation response to radiative forcing from GHGs, solar forcing and absorbing aerosols (<a class="reference-link" href="#Xie--2013">Xie et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Samset--2016">Samset et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kasoar--2018">Kasoar et al., 2018</a>).

As such, droughts occupy a unique space within the framework of extreme climate and weather events, possessing no singular definition.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">While the role of precipitation in droughts is obvious, other climatic drivers are also important, such as temperature, radiation, wind, and humidity (Figure 8.6). These factors have a strong influence on atmospheric evaporative demand, which affects evapotranspiration and soil moisture (Figure 8.6). In snow-dominated regions, high temperatures increase the fraction of precipitation falling as rain instead of snow and advance the timing of spring snowmelt (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>)<span lang="en-US"> (Vincent </span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2015; Mote</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2016, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Berg--2017">Berg and Hall, 2017</a>; Solander</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2018)</span>.

Plants also affect the severity of droughts by modulating evapotranspiration (Figure 8.6). As discussed above, the effect of elevated CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-10">2</sub> on plants has the potential to both increase and reduce water loss through evapotranspiration via enhanced WUE and plant growth, respectively (Figure 8.6), but there is <i class="•-Condensed-italic">low confidence</i> in whether one process dominates over another at the global scale.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Drought severity also depends on human activities and decision-making<span lang="en-US"> (AghaKouchak</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2015; Van Loon</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2016; Pendergrass</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2020)</span>.

While potentially buffering water resource capacity, in some cases these interventions may unexpectedly increase vulnerability (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</i>). For example, while increased irrigation efficiency may ensure more water is available to crops, the corresponding reduction in runoff and subsurface recharge may exacerbate hydrologic drought (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grafton--2018">Grafton et al., 2018</a>). Furthermore, while building dams and increasing surface reservoir capacity can boost water resources, they may actually increase drought vulnerability if demands rise to take advantage of the increased supply or if over-reliance on these surface reservoirs is encouraged (Di Baldassarre et al., 2018). Interactions between adaptation, vulnerability, and drought impacts are discussed further in WGII (Chapters 2 and 4).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">In summary, there is <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> that a warming climate drives an increase in atmospheric evaporative demand, decreasing available soil moisture.

Precipitation changes are computed from observations and from Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) CMIP6 experiments over the historical period with all-forcing (ALL), GHG-only forcing (labelled GHG), Aerosol-only (AER) and Natural (NAT) forcings prescribed. Observations are based on the CRU (light green) and GPCC (light blue) datasets and the APHRODITE (light orange) dataset for SAsiaM and EAsiaM. CMIP6 simulations are taken from nine CMIP6 models contributing to DAMIP, with at least three members. Ensembles are weight-averaged for the respective model ensemble size. Observed trends are shown as coloured circles and the simulated trends from the CMIP6 multi-model experiments are shown as box-whisker plots. Precipitation anomaly time-series are shown in the second and third row. The thick black line is the multi-model ensemble-mean precipitation anomaly time-series from the ALL experiment and the grey shading shows the spread across the multi-model ensembles. An 11-year running mean has been applied on the precipitation anomaly time-series prior to calculating the multi-model ensemble mean.

These include the weak signal-to-noise ratio of projected hydrological changes in low to medium emissions scenarios, the sensitivity of their statistical significance to the baseline reference period, and the non-Gaussian distribution of many water cycle variables (see Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1 for more details on strengths and limitations of the hatching methods implemented within AR6).</p><div class="h3-container" id="8.4.1.1"><h3 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">8.4.1.1 Global Water Cycle Intensity and P–E Over Land and Oceans<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-27-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">As discussed in 8.3.1.1, the definition of global water cycle intensity varies from the simple metric of increases in global mean precipitation to broader joint considerations of water vapour and its transport, precipitation minus evaporation (P–E) rates and continental runoff (Figure 8.1). The AR5 determined that globally averaged precipitation is <i class="•-Condensed-italic">virtually certain</i> to increase with temperature and that there is <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> that the contrast of annual mean precipitation between dry and wet regions and seasons will increase over most of the globe as temperatures and moisture transports increase (<a class="reference-link" href="#Collins--2013">Collins et al., 2013</a>). The AR5 also highlighted that continued ocean warming for a few decades after GHG forcing stabilizes or begins to decrease will also lead to further increases in global mean precipitation and evaporation.</p><div class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" id="_idContainer039"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Table 8.1 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Global and global land annual mean water cycle projections in the mid-term </span> (<span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">2041–2060</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">) and long term </span> (<span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">2081–2100</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">) relative to present day </span> (<span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">1995–2014</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">), showing present day mean and 90% confidence range across CMIP6 models (historical experiment) and projected mean changes and the 90% confidence range across the same set of models and a range of Shared Socio-economic Pathway scenarios. </span> Note that the exact value of changes can vary slightly based on the number of models assessed, but not sufficiently to affect the assessment.

Additionally, there has been relatively little general evaluation of moisture transport in models. In CMIP5 models, both the mean and variability of the vertically-integrated moisture transport is projected to increase, largely due to increases in water vapour (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lavers--2015">Lavers et al., 2015</a>), with substantial regional differences (<a class="reference-link" href="#Levang--2015">Levang and Schmitt, 2015</a>). Single-model studies have illustrated projected increases in low-altitude moisture transport into convergence regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Allan--2014">Allan et al., 2014</a>) and from ocean to land (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zahn--2013">Zahn and Allan, 2013</a>) that are consistent with present day trends. Increases in moisture transport have been linked to increases in large precipitation accumulations over land (<a class="reference-link" href="#Norris--2019">Norris et al., 2019</a>). Based on robust physics and supported by modelling studies, it is well understood that moisture transport increases into convergent parts of the atmospheric circulation such as storm systems, the tropical rain belt and high latitudes (<a class="section-link" data-title="Thermodynamic Constraints on Atmospheric Moisture Fluxes" href="#8.2.2.1">Section 8.2.2.1</a>), but changes in atmospheric circulation that are less well understood alter moisture transport regionally (<a class="section-link" data-title="Large-scale Responses in Atmospheric Circulation Patterns" href="#8.2.2.2">Section 8.2.2.2</a>).

However, CMIP6 models show a diversity of SST warming patterns in the tropical Pacific (<a class="reference-link" href="#Freund--2020">Freund et al., 2020</a>), which contributes to uncertainties in the response of both Walker circulation and ENSO to continued warming.</p><div class="•-Graphic-insert" id="_idContainer061"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-27" id="figure-8-21" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_8_21.png"></span></span></strong><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Figure 8.21 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Schematic depicting large-scale circulation changes and impacts on the regional water cycle. </span> The central figures show precipitation minus evaporation (P–E) changes at 3°C or global warming relative to an 1850–1900 base period (mean of 23 CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 simulations).

Since AR5, most studies have confirmed projected increases in South Asian monsoon precipitation (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>), while one high-resolution model (35 km in latitude/longitude) projects monsoon precipitation decreases during the 21st century following the RCP4.5 scenario (<a class="reference-link" href="#Krishnan--2016">Krishnan et al., 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Over South Asia, the moisture-bearing monsoon low-level jet is projected to shift northward in CMIP3 and CMIP5 models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sandeep--2015">Sandeep and Ajayamohan, 2015</a>). Greater warming over the Asian land region compared to the ocean contributes to intensification of the monsoon low-level south-westerly winds and precipitation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Endo--2018">Endo et al., 2018</a>), even though the combined effect of upper and lower tropospheric warming makes the Asian monsoon circulation response rather complicated. A high resolution model projection, based on the RCP8.5 scenario, indicates that a northward shift of the low-level jet and associated weakening of the large-scale monsoon circulation can induce a large reduction in the genesis of monsoon low pressure systems by the late 21st century (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sandeep--2018">Sandeep et al., 2018</a>). Experiments with constant forcing indicate that at 1.5°C and 2°C global warming levels, mean precipitation and monsoon extremes are projected to intensify in summer over India and South Asia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chevuturi--2018">Chevuturi et al., 2018</a>; D. <a class="reference-link" href="#Lee--2018"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Lee--2018">Lee et al., 2018</a>) and that a 0.5°C difference would imply a 3% increase of precipitation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chevuturi--2018">Chevuturi et al., 2018</a>).

Table 8.2 confirms that changes in runoff and P–E over SAsiaM region are positive and largest in the higher emissions scenarios considered, as in precipitation. On the other hand, changes in the ensemble mean for all the variables considered in the SSP1-1.9 scenario are negative for both mid and long-term periods (Table 8.2). This is also consistently reflected in the spatial map of future precipitation changes (Figure 8.15). Different near-term projections of the SAsiaM may result given the diversity in the future aerosol emissions pathways and policies for regulating air pollution (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wilcox--2020">Wilcox et al., 2020</a>). Additionally, near-term projections of SAsiaM precipitation are expected to be constrained by internal variability associated with the PDV (X. <a class="reference-link" href="#Huang--2020">Huang et al., 2020</a>a). CMIP6 models also indicate a lengthening of the summer monsoon over India by the end of the 21st century, at least in SSP2-4.5, with considerable inter-model spread in the projected late retreat (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ha--2020">Ha et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">In summary, consistent with AR5, there is <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> that SAsiaM precipitation is projected to increase during the 21st century in response to continued global warming across the CMIP6 higher emissions scenarios, mostly in the mid- and long terms.</p></div></div><div class="h4-container" id="8.4.2.4.2"><h4 class="numbered">8.4.2.4.2 East Asian Monsoon<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h4><div class="h4-siblings" id="h4-20-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">In AR5, the East Asian monsoon (EAsiaM) was projected to intensify in terms of precipitation, with an earlier onset and longer duration of the summer season.

Furthermore, the EAsiaM precipitation enhancements in the CMIP5 projections are prominent over the southern part of the Baiu rainband by the late 21st century, with no significant changes in the Meiyu precipitation over central-eastern China (<a class="reference-link" href="#Horinouchi--2019">Horinouchi et al., 2019</a>). It was also shown that the Baiu precipitation response in CMIP5 projections is accompanied by a southward retreat of the western North Pacific subtropical high and a southward shift of the East Asian subtropical jet (<a class="reference-link" href="#Horinouchi--2019">Horinouchi et al., 2019</a>).

For example, the comparison of simulated tropical precipitation across three successive generations of CMIP models (including CMIP6) indicates overall little improvement for the summer monsoons, the double-ITCZ bias, the diurnal cycle and the frequency of precipitation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fiedler--2020">Fiedler et al., 2020</a>). Some of these issues are related to inherent model limitations in three specific areas: atmospheric convection, cloud<span class="CharOverride-6" lang="en-US">–</span>aerosol interactions and land surface processes (ocean and cryosphere-related processes are addressed in Chapter 9). These limitations do not weaken the overall progress made in the large-scale simulation of present-day climate (FAQ 3.3 and <a class="section-link" data-title="Precipitation" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-3#3.3.2.3">Section 3.3.2.3</a>), even though the improvement of CMIP6 compared with CMIP5 models is limited (Figure 3.12) and is generally less systematic or obvious at the regional scale (e.g., <span lang="en-US">Gusain</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2020; Monerie</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2020; Oudar</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2020a)</span>.

While such parametrizations can be evaluated against field observations (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Abdel-Lathif--2018">Abdel-Lathif et al., 2018</a>), it remains challenging to estimate convective entrainment that is valid for both shallow and deep convection (G.J. <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2016"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2016"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2016"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2016">Zhang et al., 2016</a>).

The projected increase in the magnitude of extreme precipitation is generally proportional to the global warming level, with an increase of around 7% per 1°C warming (<a class="section-link" data-title="Projections" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11#11.4.5">Section 11.4.5</a>) although this rate shows seasonal and geographical variations and is slightly less for five-day than for one-day precipitation maxima.

Although the high surface albedo of the desert stabilizes the energy balance of the system (<a class="reference-link" href="#Charney--1975">Charney, 1975</a>), greening can induce strong, positive feedbacks between the land surface and precipitation that can shift the region into a ‘Green Sahara’ state. The fact that the transition phase between a Desert Sahara and Green Sahara is not theoretically stable (Brovkin et al., 1998) creates a tipping point and allows for the possibility of an abrupt shift between dry and wet climate regimes. Paleoclimate reconstructions provide evidence of past Green Sahara states (DeMenocal and Tierney, 2012), under which rainfall rates increased by an order of magnitude (Tierney et al., 2017), leading to a vegetated landscape (Jolly et al., 1998) with large lake basins (Gasse, 2000; <a class="reference-link" href="#Drake--2006">Drake and Bristow, 2006</a>). The underlying driver of the Green Sahara is the periodic increase in summer insolation associated with the orbital precession cycle (Kutzbach, 1981). In this sense, Green Saharas are not direct analogues for a response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), as these past states were forced by natural, seasonal changes in solar radiation. However, the climate dynamics of Green Sahara periods (which have global impacts, <a class="reference-link" href="#Pausata--2020">Pausata et al., 2020</a>), and the speed of the transitions between Desert Saharas and Green Saharas, are relevant for future projections.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Since AR5, paleoclimatic studies have improved our view of the timing, spatial extent, and speed of transitions associated with the early Holocene (11,000–5,000 years ago) Green Sahara. Observed transitions into and out of Green Sahara states are always faster than the underlying forcing, in agreement with theoretical considerations (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>) (Tierney and DeMenocal, 2013; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shanahan--2015">Shanahan et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tierney--2017">Tierney et al., 2017</a>).

Both paleoclimate data and modelling experiments suggest that the timing and speed of the transition was spatially heterogeneous (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>), with northern Saharan locations becoming drier thousands of years before more equatorial locations (Shanahan et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tierney--2017">Tierney et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dallmeyer--2020">Dallmeyer et al., 2020</a>). These observations are consistent with theoretical studies suggesting that spatial heterogeneity and diversity in ecosystems can mitigate the probability of catastrophic change (Van Nes and Scheffer, 2005; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bathiany--2013">Bathiany et al., 2013</a>).

Some plants are better at retaining water than others, so changes in vegetation can affect how much water infiltrates into the ground, flows into streams and rivers, or is evaporated.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">More globally, land-use change is currently responsible for about 15% of the emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities, leading to global warming, which in turn affects precipitation, evaporation, and plant transpiration. In addition, higher atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide due to human activities can make plants more efficient at retaining water because the stomata do not need to open so widely. Improved land and water management (e.g., reforestation, sustainable irrigation) can also contribute to reducing climate change and adapting to some of its adverse consequences.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">In summary, there is abundant evidence that changes in land use and land cover alter the water cycle globally, regionally and locally, by changing precipitation, evaporation, flooding, groundwater, and the availability of freshwater for a variety of uses. Since all the components of the water cycle are connected (and linked to the carbon cycle), changes in land use trickle down to many other components of the water cycle and climate system.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" id="faq-8-1-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_8_1_Figure_1.png"></span></span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 8.1, Figure 1 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Land-use changes and their consequences on the water cycle. </span>As all the components or the water cycle are tightly connected, changes in one aspect of the cycle affects almost all the cycle.</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><h2 class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 8.2 | Will Floods Become More Severe or More Frequent as a Result of Climate Change?</span><span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-24-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US" id="faq-8-2"><i class="•-Regular-Italic">A warmer climate increases the amount and intensity of rainfall during wet events, and this is expected to amplify the severity of flooding. However, the link between rainfall and flooding is complex, so while the most severe flooding events are expected to worsen, floods could become rarer in some</i><i class="•-Regular-Italic">regions. </i></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Floods are a natural and important part of the water cycle but they can also threaten lives and safety, disrupt human activities, and damage infrastructure. Most inland floods occur when rivers overtop their banks (<i class="•-Regular-Italic">fluvial</i><i class="•-Condensed-italic"></i>flooding) or when intense rainfall causes water to build up and overflow locally (<i class="•-Regular-Italic">pluvial</i>flooding). Flooding is also caused by coastal inundation by the sea, rapid seasonal melting of snow, and the accumulation of debris, such as vegetation or ice, that stops water from draining away.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Climate change is already altering the location, frequency and severity of flooding. Close to the coasts, rising sea levels increasingly cause more frequent and severe coastal flooding, and the severity of these floods is exacerbated when combined with heavy rainfall. The heavy and sustained rainfall events responsible for most inland flooding are becoming more intense in many areas as the climate warms because air near Earth’s surface can carry around 7% more water in its gas phase (vapour) for each 1°C of warming. This extra moisture is drawn into weather systems, fueling heavier rainfall (FAQ 8.2, Figure 1).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">A warming climate also affects wind patterns, how storms form and evolve, and the pathway those storms usually travel. Warming also increases condensation rates, which in turn releases extra heat that can energize storm systems and further intensify rainfall. On the other hand, this energy release can also inhibit the uplift required for cloud development, while increases in particle pollution can delay rainfall but invigorate storms. These changes mean that the character of precipitation events (how often, how long lasting and how heavy they are) will continue to change as the climate warms.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">In addition to climate change, the location, frequency and timing of the heaviest rainfall events and worst flooding depend on natural fluctuations in wind patterns that make some regions unusually wet or dry for months, years, or even decades. These natural variations make it difficult to determine whether heavy rainfall events are changing locally as a result of global warming. However, when natural weather patterns bring heavy and prolonged rainfall in a warmer climate, the intensity is increased by the larger amount of moisture in the air.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">An increased intensity and frequency of record-breaking daily rainfall has been detected for much of the land surface where good observational records exist, and this can only be explained by human-caused increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Heavy rainfall is also projected to become more intense in the future for most places. So, where unusually wet weather events or seasons occur, the rainfall amounts are expected to be greater in the future, contributing to more severe flooding.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">However, heavier rainfall does not always lead to greater flooding. This is because flooding also depends upon the type of river basin, the surface landscape, the extent and duration of the rainfall, and how wet the ground is before the rainfall event (FAQ 8.2, Figure 1). Some regions will experience a drying in the soil as the climate warms, particularly in subtropical climates, which could make floods from a rainfall event less probable because the ground can potentially soak up more of the rain. On the other hand, less frequent but more intense downpours can lead to dry, hard ground that is less able to soak up heavy rainfall when it does occur, resulting in more runoff into lakes, rivers and hollows. Earlier spring snowmelt combined with more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow can trigger flood events in cold regions. Reduced winter snow cover can, in contrast, decrease the chance of flooding arising from the combination of rainfall and rapid snowmelt. Rapid melting of glaciers and snow in a warming climate is already increasing river flow in some regions, but as the volumes of ice diminish, flows will peak and then decline in the future. Flooding is also affected by changes in the management of the land and river systems. For example, clearing forests for agriculture or building cities can make rainwater flow more rapidly into rivers or low-lying areas. On the other hand, increased extraction of water from rivers can reduce water levels and the likelihood of flooding.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">A mix of both increases and decreases in flooding have been observed in some regions and these changes have been attributed to multiple causes, including changes in snowmelt, soil moisture and rainfall. Although we know that a warming climate will intensify rainfall events, local and regional trends are expected to vary in both direction and magnitude as global warming results in multiple, and sometimes counteracting, influences. However, even accounting for the many factors that generate flooding, when weather patterns cause flood events in a warmer future, these floods will be more severe.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" id="faq-8-2-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_8_2_Figure_1.png"></span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title _idGenParaOverride-1 faq-fix" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 8.2, Figure 1 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Schematic illustrating factors important in determining changes in heavy precipitation and flooding. </span></p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><h2 class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 8.3 | What Causes Droughts, and Will Climate Change Make Them Worse?</span><span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-25-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US" id="faq-8-3"><i class="•-Regular-Italic">Droughts usually begin as a deficit of precipitation, but then propagate to other parts of the water cycle (soils, rivers, snow/ice and water reservoirs). They are also influenced by factors like temperature, vegetation and human land and water management. In a warmer world, evaporation increases, which can make even wet regions more susceptible t</i><i class="•-Regular-Italic">o drought. </i></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">A drought is broadly defined as drier than normal conditions; that is, a moisture deficit relative to the average water availability at a given location and season. Since they are locally defined, a drought in a wet place will not have the same amount of water deficit as a drought in a dry region. Droughts are divided into different categories based on where in the water cycle the moisture deficit occurs: meteorological drought (precipitation), hydrological drought (runoff, streamflow, and reservoir storage), and agricultural or ecological drought (plant stress from a combination of evaporation and low soil moisture). Special categories of drought also exist. For example, a snow drought occurs when winter snowpack levels are below average, which can cause abnormally low streamflow in subsequent seasons. And while many drought events develop slowly over months or years, some events, called flash droughts, can intensify over the course of days or weeks. One such event occurred in 2012 in the Midwestern region of North America and had a severe impact on agricultural production, with losses exceeding $30 billion US dollars. Droughts typically only become a concern when they adversely affect people (reducing water available for municipal, industrial, agricultural, or navigational needs) and/or ecosystems (adverse effects on natural flora and fauna). When a drought lasts for a very long time (more than two decades) it is sometimes called a megadrought.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Most droughts begin when precipitation is below normal for an extended period of time (meteorological drought). This typically occurs when high pressure in the atmosphere sets up over a region, reducing cloud formation and precipitation over that area and deflecting away storms. The lack of rainfall then propagates across the water cycle to create agricultural drought in soils and hydrological drought in waterways. Other processes act to amplify or alleviate droughts. For example, if temperatures are abnormally high, evaporation increases, drying out soils and streams and stressing plants beyond what would have occurred from the lack of precipitation alone. Vegetation can play a critical role because it modulates many important hydrologic processes (soil water, evapotranspiration, runoff). Human activities can also determine how severe a drought is. For example, irrigating croplands can reduce the socio-economic impact of a drought; at the same time, depletion of groundwater in aquifers can make a drought worse.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">The effect of climate change on drought varies across regions. In the subtropical regions like the Mediterranean, southern Africa, south-western Australia and south-western South America, as well as tropical Central America, western Africa and the Amazon basin, precipitation is expected to decline as the world warms, increasing the possibility that drought will occur throughout the year (FAQ 8.3, Figure 1). Warming will decrease snowpack, amplifying drought in regions where snowmelt is an important water resource (such as in south-western South America). Higher temperatures lead to increased evaporation, resulting in soil drying, increased plant stress, and impacts on agriculture, even in regions where large changes in precipitation are not expected (such as central and northern Europe). If emissions of greenhouse gases are not curtailed, about a third of global land areas are projected to suffer from at least moderate drought by 2100. On the other hand, some areas and seasons (such as high-latitude regions in North America and Asia, and the South Asian monsoon region) may experience increases in precipitation as a result of climate change, which will decrease the likelihood of droughts. FAQ 8.3, Figure 1 highlights the regions where climate change is expected to increase the severity of droughts.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body faq-fix" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" id="faq-8-3-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_8_3_Figure_1.png"></span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 8.3, Figure 1 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Schematic map highlighting in brown the regions where droughts are expected to become worse as a result of climate change. </span> This pattern is similar regardless of the emissions scenario; however, the magnitude of change increases under higher emissions.</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_•-References-heading"><span class="•-Bold-condensed">References</span></h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-11-siblings"><p class="References_•-References-body-copy" id="Aadhar--2020">Aadhar, S. and V.
