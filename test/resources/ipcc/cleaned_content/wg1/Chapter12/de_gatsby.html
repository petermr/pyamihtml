In many tropical regions, the number of days per year where an HI of 41°C is exceeded will increase by more than 100 days relative to the recent past under SSP5-8.5, while this increase will be limited to less than 50 days under SSP1-2.6 (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>).

This chapter concentrates on drivers of impacts that are of climatic origin (see also the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5, <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC, 2018</a>), and <a class="section-link" data-title="Lines of Evidence: Paleoclimate" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.3.2">Section 1.3.2</a> in this Report), referred to in WGI as ‘climatic impact-drivers’ (CIDs). CIDs are physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, extremes) that affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions. However, this chapter largely focuses on drivers commonly connected to hazards, and adopts the IPCC risk framework (Cross-Chapter Box 1.3) since the main objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to ‘prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system’ (Article 2).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">In some cases, risk assessments may require climate information beyond the CIDs identified in this chapter, with further impacts or risk modelling often driven by historical climate forcing datasets (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Ruane--2021">Ruane et al., 2021</a>) and full climate scenario time series (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Lange--2019">Lange, 2019</a>) produced using methods described in Chapter 10. <a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Change Information for Regional Impact and for Risk Assessment" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-12">Chapter 12</a> focuses on the assessment of a finite number of drivers and how they are projected to evolve with climate change, in order to inform impact and risk assessments.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">This chapter is new in IPCC WGI assessment reports, in that it represents a contribution to the ‘IPCC risk framework’. Within this framework, climate-related impacts and risks are determined through an interplay between the occurrence of climate hazards and their consequences depending on the exposure of the affected human or natural system and its vulnerability to the hazardous conditions. In Chapter 12, we are assessing climatic impact-drivers that could lead to hazards or to opportunities, from the literature and model results since AR5. This will particularly support the assessment of key risks related to climate change by WGII (Chapter 16). Despite the fact that impacts may also be induced by climate adaptation and mitigation policies themselves, as well as by socio-economic trends, changes in vulnerability or exposure, and external geophysical hazards such as volcanoes, the focus here is only on climatic impacts and risks induced by shifts in physical climate phenomena that directly influence human and ecological systems (Cross-chapter Box 1.3).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">This chapter follows the terminology associated with the framing introduced in <a class="section-link" data-title="Framing, Context and Methods" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1">Chapter 1</a> (Cross-Chapter Box 1.2) and as found in Annex VII: Glossary.

Thresholds can be used to measure various aspects of the climatic impact-driver (magnitude or intensity, duration, frequency, timing, and spatial extent of threshold exceedance). For instance, a threshold of daily maximum temperature above 35°C is considered critical for maize pollination and production (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Schauberger--2017">Schauberger et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tesfaye--2017">Tesfaye et al., 2017</a>).</li></ul><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The approach adopted here is consistent with the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030, which aims to face disaster consequences (including but not limited to climate disasters) and reduce risks in natural, managed and built environments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aitsi-Selmi--2015">Aitsi-Selmi et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNISDR--2015">UNISDR, 2015</a>). The classification of climatic impact-drivers in this chapter is largely consistent with the classification of hazards used in the Sendai Framework. However, the UNISDR hazard list spans a wider range of hazards inducing damage to society, including hazards that are not directly related to climate (such as volcanoes and earthquakes), which are excluded from the assessment herein. Furthermore, the UNISDR classification of hazards does not include mean climatic conditions, which are also discussed as climatic impact-drivers in this chapter.

This survey builds on the work of the World Meteorological Organization Expert Team on Sector-Specific Climate Indices (ET-SCI) and previous IPCC assessments, notably AR5 WGII (<a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2014">Birkmann et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>) and IPCC Special Reports (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC, 2018</a>, 2019b, c) that have assessed climate hazards affecting sectors but is organized from a CID perspective drawing also upon recent summaries of sectoral hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mora--2018">Mora et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#ICOMOS--2019">ICOMOS, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yokohata--2019">Yokohata et al., 2019</a>). Impacts, risks and opportunities are rarely attributable to a single CID index or threshold, but climate shifts that push conditions outside of expected conditions and beyond tolerance levels are indicative of impact, risk or benefit given vulnerability and exposure. Focus is on direct sectoral connections of a CID (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hallegatte--2010">Hallegatte and Przyluski, 2010</a>) rather than cascading or secondary effects (e.g., water-borne diseases following a flood, mental health challenges following a severe storm, or the effects of drought on poverty), as these are strongly affected by exposure, vulnerability and response, as discussed in the WGII Report.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Table 12.2 presents a summary of (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climatic Impact-drivers for Sectors" href="#12.3">Section 12.3</a> connections between CIDs as defined in Table 12.1 and key sectoral assets, utilizing the WGII organization of sectors (corresponding to WGII Chapters 2–8). Colours are shown for connections with at least <i class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</i> as assessed from sectoral impacts and risk literature, with relevance assessed according to the prominence of that specific CID/asset connection in analyses of current and future impacts and risk. Within each sector there is a multitude of specific sectoral systems that may be affected by CID increases and decreases, with consequences further distinguished by region, background climate and socio-economic or ecological context of the affected asset. Our aim is therefore to recognize important drivers and the common attributes of change within each CID that scientists and practitioners monitor to understand current and future challenges for important asset groups, thereby pointing to the climate information that needs to be tailored and analysed for impacts and for risk assessment (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Change Information in Climate Services" href="#12.6">Section 12.6</a>). Additional effects whereby CIDs affect each other (across Table 12.2 columns) are discussed as climatic phenomena within WGI.

For extreme heat, cold spell, heavy precipitation and drought CIDs that are assessed in Chapter 11, here we draw projections from the 2°C GWL tables in <a class="section-link" data-title="Regional Information on Extremes" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11#11.9">Section 11.9</a>. In some cases, more details are needed in order to emphasize one aspect of projected CID change. For instance, the change in a CID may be different for intensity, duration, frequency; or there can be strong sub-regional or seasonal signals; or different CID indices may have conflicting signals. A footnote is added in such cases, but a confidence level for a direction of projected change is given based on the <a class="section-link" data-title="Climatic Impact-drivers for Sectors" href="#12.3">Section 12.3</a> assessment of aspects of regional CID change that are most relevant for impacts and for risks. As an example, tropical cyclones are increasing in intensity but decreasing in frequency in some regions. Here, in assessing the confidence of the direction of projected change in the Tropical cyclone CID (i.e., the colour of the table cell), we assign more weight to the ‘intensity’ rather than the ‘frequency’, corresponding to the higher relevance of the intensity of major tropical cyclones for risk assessment. Low confidence of changes, arising from lack of evidence, strong spatial or seasonal heterogeneity, or lack of agreement, are represented by colour-less cells, and, for the sake of simplicity, only two categories of confidence are given: <i class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</i> and <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> (and higher).

Section 6.5 notes that climate change will have a small burden on particulate matter (PM) pollution (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</i>) while the main controlling factor in determining future concentrations will be future emissions policy for PM and their precursors (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>).

Although there is <i class="•-Condensed-italic">low confidence</i> in precise regional changes (Section 6.5), climate change will generally introduce a surface ozone (O<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-1">3</sub>) penalty (increasing concentrations with increasing warming levels) over regions with high anthropogenic and/or natural ozone precursor emissions, while in less polluted regions higher temperatures and humidity favour destruction of ozone (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schnell--2016">Schnell et al., 2016</a>). There is <i class="•-Condensed-italic">low confidence</i> in changes to future stagnation events given the lack of robust projections of related atmospheric conditions, such as future atmospheric blocking events (Sections 3.3.3 and 8.4.2).

Section 6.5 assessed <i class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</i> that climate-driven changes to meteorological conditions generally favour extreme air pollution episodes in heavily polluted environments, but noted strong regional and metric dependencies.

There is consensus among the different model ensembles (CORDEX-CORE, CMIP5 and CMIP6) that the drought frequency (DF), one of several proxies for agricultural and ecological drought, will increase in all four Australian regions for both mid-century (NAU 0.2–2 DF increase, CAU 0.5–2 DF increase, SAU 1–3 DF increase and EAU 0.8–3 DF increase) and end-century (0.8–2.7 DF increase for NAU, 1.2–2 DF increase for CAU, 2.2–3.8 for SAU and 0.2–3 for EAU) for both RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5, with CMIP6 showing the lowest increase (Figure 12.4g–l and Figure 12.SM.4; <a class="reference-link" href="#Coppola--2021b">Coppola et al., 2021b</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed">Fire weather: </span><a class="reference-link" href="#Dowdy--2018">Dowdy and Pepler (2018)</a> examined atmospheric conditions conducive to pyroconvection in the period 1979–2016, and found an increased risk in south-east Australia during spring and summer, due to changes in vertical atmospheric stability and humidity, in combination with adverse near-surface fire weather conditions. CSIRO and BOM (2018) and <a class="reference-link" href="#Dowdy--2018">Dowdy (2018)</a> found that the annual 90th percentile daily Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) has increased from 1950–2016 in parts of Australia, especially in Southern Australia (1–2.5 per decade) and in spring and summer. These studies indicate an increase in the frequency and magnitude of FFDI extreme quantiles, as well as a shift of the fire season start towards spring, lengthening the fire season. The unprecedented large fires of austral spring and summer of 2019 in south-east Australia were a result of extreme hot and dry weather in significantly drier than average conditions that had persisted since 2017, in combination with consistently stronger than average winds, resulting in above average to highest on record FFDI values in much of the country (<a class="reference-link" href="#Abram--2021">Abram et al., 2021</a>).

In New Zealand, days with very high and extreme fire weather increased in 12 out of 28 monitored sites, and decreased in 8, in the period 1997–2019 (MfE and Stats NZ, 2020).

Increasing mean temperature, cool season rainfall decline, and changes in tropical climate variability all contribute to a future increase in extreme fire risk in Australia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Abram--2021">Abram et al., 2021</a>). Projections indicate that the annual cumulative FFDI will increase by 31–33% in Southern and Eastern Australia, and by 17–25% in Northern Australia and the Rangelands by 2090 (relative to 1995) under RCP8.5 (CSIRO and BOM, 2015).

In New Zealand, <a class="reference-link" href="#Watt--2019">Watt et al.

The most marked relative changes by 2090 were projected for Wellington and Dunedin, where very high to extreme fire risk is projected to increase by, respectively, 89% to 32 days and 207% to 18 days, compared to the baseline period 1970–1999.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed">Annual mean precipitation is projected to increase in Central and north-east Australia </span> (<span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic">low confidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed">) and in the south and west of New Zealand </span> (<span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic">medium confidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed">), while it is projected to decrease in Southern Australia </span> (<span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic">medium confidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed">), albeit with</span> <span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic"> high confidence </span> <span class="•-Bold-condensed"> in south-west Western Australia, in Eastern Australia </span> (<span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic">medium confidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed">), and in the north and east of New Zealand </span> (<span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic">medium confidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed">).

The ‘time of emergence’ (ToE) or ‘temperature of emergence’ is the time or global warming level thresholds associated with this exceedance. Emergence is particularly relevant to impacts, risk assessment and adaptation because human and natural systems are largely adapted to natural variability but may be vulnerable if exposed to changes that go beyond this variability range; this is not to say that changes within natural variability have no impact, as occurrence of damaging extremes proves. Emergence also informs the timing of adaptation measures. The emergence of a change is always relative to a reference period (e.g., the pre-industrial period or a recent past), depending on the framing question. In the former case, the goal is to estimate the amplitude of an anthropogenically driven change while in the latter, it is to estimate the amplitude of change relative to a baseline that is familiar to stakeholders. Both questions are important for risk assessment, but the former may be more directly interpretable in a mitigation context. The variability also refers to a time scale, generally interannual to inter-decadal.

In many cases, however, sufficient literature for a robust region-by-region assessment of ToE is lacking. The assessment herein is made by CID. Regional emergence assessment is reported in Tables 12.3–12.11 but is undertaken in this section.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Estimations of ToE must be done with caution given the many sources of inherent uncertainties, such as observations representing only a single realization of climate history, internal variability (whose frequency – e.g., annual or decadal – needs to be precisely defined), model biases, and potential low-frequency changes in variability (Chapter 10; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lehner--2017">Lehner et al., 2017</a>). In addition, a homogeneous interpretation of multiple studies is hampered by heterogeneous methodologies used to calculate emergence. In this section, we assess emergence and its confidence level based on such multiple methods as provided by the literature, and unless specified otherwise, emergence here refers to a signal to noise ration S/N &gt; 1 relative to a pre-industrial baseline and interannual variability (the ‘noise’).

In the current climate, the highest S/N ratios exceed five over Central Africa, Amazonia, East and South East Asia. Seasonal warming emergence depends on the season.

WGI is assessing changes in climatic impact-drivers (CIDs), which are physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events and extremes) that affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions (Sections 12.1–12.3). In the assessment of Representative Key Risk (RKR) categories and Reasons for Concern (RFCs) in WGII Chapter 16, the focus lies on the adverse consequences of climate change, for which many types of CIDs (i.e., ‘hazards’ in the context of identified risks) play a key role. This box synthesizes the assessment of such hazards according to global warming levels (GWLs) from various chapters of WGI to inform understanding of their potential changes and associated risks with temperature levels in general, and in particular to facilitate WGII integrated assessments of RKRs and RFCs.

It can be traced back to the late 1970s and the US National Climate Program Act of 1978 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Henderson--2016">Henderson, 2016</a>). The development of the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) after the World Climate Conference-3 in Geneva brought international attention and renewed impetus to the climate services field (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hewitt--2012">Hewitt et al., 2012</a>). As a result, large investments have been made globally and regionally in the development of user-driven climate services. WMO has created Regional Climate Centres (RCCs) to facilitate climate service development by regional and national providers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hewitt--2020a">Hewitt et al., 2020a</a>). The European Union declared its ambition to stimulate ‘the creation of a community of climate services application developers and users that matches supply and demand for climate information and prediction’, giving primacy to climate services that are user-driven and science-informed (<a class="reference-link" href="#Louren%C3%A7o--2016">Lourenço et al., 2016</a>), thus embracing concepts of co-design, co-development and co-evaluation of climate services (<a class="reference-link" href="#Street--2016">Street, 2016</a>). Diverse and action-driven international initiatives allowed climate services to progressively shift from mitigation towards adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Larosa--2019">Larosa and Mysiak, 2019</a>). Opportunities for the development of climate services have emerged through the 2015 Agendas (Paris Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals and Sendai Framework), Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plans, Multilateral Development Banks and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (see <a class="section-link" data-title="The Policy and Governance Context" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.2.2">Section 1.2.2</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Scientific advancements in climate services related to meteorology and climatology are still closely linked to essential climate variables (<a class="reference-link" href="#Larosa--2019">Larosa and Mysiak, 2019</a>) and benefit from consistently growing computational power, infrastructure and storage capacity to meet the demands of higher spatially and temporally resolved climate information (<a class="reference-link" href="#Buontempo--2020">Buontempo et al., 2020</a>). Climate services also focus on impact chains, providing decision makers with information on climate change with cross-sectoral impact assessments for adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jacob--2017">Jacob and Solman, 2017</a>). Today there is a diversity of climate services that involve interpretation, analysis, and communication of different sources of climate data, ideally combining different types of knowledge (scientific/technical, experiential, indigenous, etc.), to a targeted group of decision makers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parris--2016">Parris et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Olazabal--2018">Olazabal et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pezij--2019">Pezij et al., 2019</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Jacobs--2020">Jacobs and Street (2020)</a> argue that climate services should be expanded to also address societal challenges, such as system transformation, that include climate in the context of other risks and development challenges.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Climate services are undertaken in public and private sectors at global, regional, national, and local scales (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hewitt--2012">Hewitt et al., 2012</a>, 2020b; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cortekar--2020">Cortekar et al., 2020</a>). Intermediaries such as private sector consulting companies, national climate service providers, research organizations, government agencies or academic institutions provide climate services that translate aspects of climate research to the specific context of decision makers (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Combining Approaches to Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-10#10.5">Section 10.5</a>).

In addition, the respective climate service context of a specific stakeholder in a sector dictates what climate information is required and on what scales and in what format it is most usefully provided. The extent and type of engagement between scientists and users is another critical aspect of climate services (see Cross-Chapter Box 12.2, Figure 1, and <a class="section-link" data-title="Combining Approaches to Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-10#10.5">Section 10.5</a>).

However, with the overarching focus on resilience, discussions evolved in that direction and the burning issues identified often centred around water in peri-urban areas, for example in Windhoek, Namibia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scott--2018">Scott et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body ParaOverride-3">The learning labs also introduced and developed the concept of Climate Risk Narratives (CRNs) as a process and product to generate and integrate climate and socio-economic information relevant to adaptation and resilience (see Cross-Chapter Box 12.2, Figure 2, and Box 10.2 on storylines) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jack--2020">Jack et al., 2020</a>). The first CRNs were informed primarily by climate evidence, but also included some tentative socio-economic impact elements gleaned from literature and other studies. Their content was intentionally provocative and designed to promote debate and discussion, and subsequent iteration. Many participants noted that this was the first time that various important conversations across governance structures and disciplinary areas had occurred around what climate change may actually mean. This demonstrates the engagement value of CRNs as a key element in an iterative co-production process to ensure important details are included correctly, such as the local context, terms and names as well as providing reality checks on the impacts and societal responses (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jack--2020">Jack et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-continued--subhead--copy ParaOverride-2">Cross-Chapter Box 12.2</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">This case study emphasizes the positive contributions of the fit, tailoring and contextualization of climate information with respect to the specific decision-making needs of particular users (<a class="section-link" data-title="Combining Approaches to Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-10#10.5">Section 10.5</a>; AR6 WGII Section 17.4.4.2.2), the importance of participatory planning for risk management in urban areas (AR6 WGII Sections 6.3.3.3 and 6.4.2) and the importance of networks and organizations which link researchers, policymakers and end-users to promote adaptation in African cities (AR6 WGII Box 9.4).

One such user is the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which has committed to making all its investments climate resilient by implementing a climate risk management framework (<a class="reference-link" href="#ADB--2014">ADB, 2014</a>, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lu--2019">Lu, 2019</a>). The climate risk management framework mandates all climate-sensitive investment projects undertake a climate risk and adaptation assessment, to identify material risks of a changing climate to the proposed project and potential adaptive measures to be incorporated into project design, implementation, maintenance and/or monitoring. Typically, loan project processing teams procure consulting services for a bespoke climate risk and adaptation assessment (CRA) for a specific project. The user –provider engagement is highly targeted and goal-oriented. An example of such a focused user –provider engagement is the CRA carried out as part of an investment project in Vietnam, the Water Efficiency Improvement in Drought-Affected Provinces (WEIDAP) project.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">In the wake of the El Niño-induced 2015–2016 severe drought, which caused major damage to agricultural land in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, the WEIDAP project was initiated to improve water productivity of irrigated agriculture. Proposed project interventions include a package of both ‘soft’ (e.g., policy, institutional and capacity building, on-farm water efficiency practices) and ‘hard’ (modernized irrigation schemes) activities. To ensure that the project delivers expected benefits under a changing climate, consultants were recruited to carry out a detailed CRA, working as part of the overall project processing team. Through extensive consultations with the rest of the project team and review of literature including relevant climate projections, the CRA consultants chose to construct three broad climate scenarios for the 2050s (a time frame appropriate for the lifetime of the irrigation schemes being proposed under the project): a warm-and-wet, a hot-and-wet, and a hotter future. Outputs from a selection of CMIP5 models were analysed under these three scenarios, to derive changes in temperature, rainfall and potential evapotranspiration, which in turn were used as inputs to hydrological, crop and agro-economics models to assess the impacts of climate change on the overall project performance. Table 1 presents the summary of the key parameters under the three scenarios. Recommendations from the CRA included (largely minor) refinements and additional activities for drought planning, detailed engineering design of the relevant project components (such as access roads, river crossings and foundations), and support for poorer farmers who may not be able to afford access to water and climate-resilient technologies.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">This case study illustrates that climate information distillation including a sustained iterative engagement between climate information users, producers and translators can improve the quality of the information and the decision-making (<a class="section-link" data-title="Combining Approaches to Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-10#10.5">Section 10.5</a>; WGII Section 17.4.4.2.2).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-Figure-title"><strong class="IPCC_•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed"> Cross-Chapter Box 12.2, Table </span></strong><strong class="IPCC_•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">1 | </span></strong><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Summary of annual province-level changes in temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration under the three broad scenarios in southern Vietnam. </span> <span class="•-Bold-condensed"></span> Scenario 1: warm-and-wet; Scenario 2: hot-and-wet; Scenario 3: hotter.

based on a rapidly growing body of new evidence from the peer-reviewed literature, direct calculations of climate projections from several new model ensembles, and results from other AR6 WGI chapters. Although a large amount a new information on CID changes and their uptake in climate services has become available since AR5, some challenges still remain. This section summarizes some of these main challenges, with a view to facilitating improved assessments in future. The section is organized following the order of chapter sections and consolidated according to key assessment components.</p><ul><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---first">The adoption of the climatic impact-driver (CID) framework could benefit from stronger connections across disciplines, including between physical climate and impact scientists, and between the science community and practitioners/stakeholders on the ground. Co-development of CID index definitions with impact scientists or stakeholders helps ensure their salience and utility (Sections 12.1, 12.2, 12.3 and 12.6).</li><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---continued">The ability to project all aspects of shifting CID profiles and their effects at fine, local scales is often reliant on dynamical downscaling and additional impact modelling steps, making a robust and full quantification of the uncertainties involved more challenging. Availability of multiple models and ease of connecting physical climate models at different scales can facilitate assessment (Sections 12.2, 12.3, 12.4 and 12.5).</li><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---continued">Regional and sub-regional differences in coverage and access of homogeneous historical records, in the deployment of regional model ensembles and the exploration of scenarios, and ultimately in peer-reviewed studies addressing the full range of past and current behaviour, detection and attribution, and future projections challenge a uniformly robust assessment across all CIDs and regions of the world (Sections 12.4 and 12.5).</li><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---continued">Efforts to assess a consistent global, large-scale view of CID changes across regions and sectors would benefit from additional coordinated studies adopting common CID indices, model protocols, time horizons and scenarios or global warming levels (Sections 12.3 and 12.5).</li><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---last">Even though the body of peer-reviewed literature regarding climate services practices and products is growing, a large part is still documented only in grey literature arising from commercial consultancy, and thus is not publicly and freely accessible (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Change Information in Climate Services" href="#12.6">Section 12.6</a>).</li></ul></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="frequently-asked-questions"><h1 class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-heading" lang="en-US">Frequently Asked Questions</h1><div class="h2-container"><h2 class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 12.1 | What Is a Climatic Impact-driver (CID)?</span><span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-24-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-SUMMARY-para" lang="en-US" id="faq-12-1">A climatic impact-driver is a physical climate condition that directly affects society or ecosystems. Climatic impact-drivers may represent a long-term average condition (such as the average winter temperatures that affect indoor heating requirements), a common event (such as a frost that kills off warm-season plants), or an extreme event (such as a coastal flood that destroys homes). A single climatic impact-driver may lead to detrimental effects for one part of society while benefiting another, while others are not affected at all. A climatic impact-driver (or its change caused by climate change) is therefore not universally hazardous or beneficial, but we refer to it as a ‘hazard’ when experts determine it is detrimental to a specific system.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Climate change can alter many aspects of the climate system, but efforts to identify impacts and risks usually focus on a smaller set of changes known to affect, or potentially affect, things that society cares about. These<span class="Standard-italic">climatic impact-drivers</span>(CIDs) are formally defined in this Report as ‘physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, extremes) that affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions’. Because people, infrastructure and ecosystems interact directly with their immediate environment, climate experts assess CIDs locally and regionally. CIDs may relate to temperature, the water cycle, wind and storms, snow and ice, oceanic and coastal processes or the chemistry and energy balance of the climate system. Future impacts and risk may also be directly affected by factors unrelated to the climate (such as socio-economic development, population growth, or a viral outbreak) that may also alter the vulnerability or exposure of systems.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">CIDs capture important characteristics of the average climate and both common and extreme events that shape society and nature (see FAQ 12.2). Some CIDs focus on aspects of the average climate (such as the seasonal progression of temperature and precipitation, average winds or the chemistry of the ocean) that determine, for example, species distribution, farming systems, the location of tourist resorts, the availability of water resources and the expected heating and cooling needs for buildings in an average year. CIDs also include common episodic events that are particularly important to systems, such as thaw events that can trigger the development of plants in spring, cold spells that are important for fruit crop chill requirements, or frost events that eliminate summer vegetation as winter sets in. Finally, CIDs include many extreme events connected to impacts such as hailstorms that damage vehicles, coastal floods that destroy shoreline property, tornadoes that damage infrastructure, droughts that increase competition for water resources, and heatwaves that can strain the health of outdoor labourers.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Many aspects of our daily lives, businesses and natural systems depend on weather and climate, and there is great interest in anticipating the impacts of climate change on the things we care about. To meet these needs, scientists engage with companies and authorities to provide climate services – meaningful and possibly actionable climate information designed to assist decision-making. Climate science and services can focus on CIDs that substantially disrupt systems to support broader risk management approaches. A single CID change can have dramatically different implications for different sectors or even elements of the same sector, so engagement between climate scientists and stakeholders is important to contextualize the climate changes that will come. Climate services responding to planning and optimization of an activity can focus on more gradual changes in operating climate conditions.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">FAQ 12.1, Figure 1 tracks example outcomes of seasonal snow cover changes that connect climate science to the need for mitigation, adaptation and regional risk management. The length of the season with snow on the ground is just one of many regional climate conditions that may change in the future, and it becomes a CID because there are many elements of society and ecosystems that rely on an expected seasonality of snow cover. Climate scientists and climate service providers examining human-driven climate change may identify different regions where the length of the season with snow cover could increase, decrease, or stay relatively unaffected. In each region, change in seasonal snow cover may affect different systems in beneficial or detrimental ways (in the latter case, changing seasonal snow cover would be a ‘hazard’), although systems such as coastal aquaculture remain relatively unaffected. The changing profile of benefits and hazards connected to these changes in the seasonal snow cover CID affects the profile of impacts, risks and benefits that stakeholders in the region will grapple with in response to climate change.</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title ParaOverride-5" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">FAQ 12.1, Figure 1 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">A single climatic impact-driver can affect ecosystems and society in different ways. </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>A variety of impacts from the same climatic impact-driver change, illustrated with the example of regional seasonal snow cover.</p></div></div><h2 class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 12.2 | What Are Climatic Thresholds and Why Are They Important?</span><span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-25-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-SUMMARY-para" lang="en-US" id="faq-12-2">Climatic thresholds tell us about the tolerance of society and ecosystems so that we can better scrutinize the types of climate changes that are expected to impact things we care about. Many systems have natural or structural thresholds. If conditions exceed those thresholds, the result can be sudden changes or even collapses in health, productivity, utility or behaviour. Adaptation and risk management efforts can change these thresholds, altering the profile of climate conditions that would be problematic and increasing overall system resilience.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Decision makers have long observed that certain weather and climate conditions can be problematic, or hazardous, for things they care about (i.e., things with socio-economic, cultural or intrinsic value). Many elements of society and ecosystems operate in a suitable climate zone selected naturally or by stakeholders considering the expected climate conditions. However, as climate change moves conditions beyond expected ranges, they may cross a climatic ‘threshold’ – a level beyond which there are either gradual changes in system behaviour or abrupt, non-linear and potentially irreversible impacts.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Climatic thresholds can be associated with either natural or structural tolerance levels. Natural thresholds, for instance, include heat and humidity conditions above which humans cannot regulate their internal temperatures through sweat, drought durations that heighten competition between species, and winter temperatures that are lethal for pests or disease-carrying vector species. Structural thresholds include engineered limits of drainage systems, extreme wind speeds that limit wind turbine operation, the height of coastal protection infrastructure, and the locations of irrigation infrastructure or tropical cyclone sheltering facilities.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Thresholds may be defined according to raw values (such as maximum temperature exceeding 35°C) or percentiles (such as the local 99th percentile daily rainfall total). They also often have strong seasonal dependence (see FAQ 12.3). For example, the amount of snowfall that a deciduous tree can withstand depends on whether the snowfall occurs before or after the tree sheds its leaves. Most systems respond to changes in complex ways, and those responses are not determined solely or precisely by specific thresholds of a single climate variable. Nonetheless, thresholds can be useful indicators of system behaviours, and an understanding of these thresholds can help inform risk management decisions.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">FAQ 12.2 Figure 1 illustrates how threshold conditions can help us understand climate conditions that are suitable for normal system operation and the thresholds beyond which impacts occur. Crops tend to grow most optimally within a suitable range of daily temperatures that is influenced by the varieties being cultivated and the way the farm is managed. As daily temperatures rise above a ‘critical’ temperature threshold, plants begin to experience heat stress that reduces growth and may lower resulting yields. If temperatures reach a higher ‘limiting’ temperature threshold, crops may suffer leaf loss, pollen sterility, or tissue damage that can lead to crop failure. Farmers typically select a cropping system with some consideration to the probability of extreme temperature events that may occur within a typical season, and so identifying hot temperature thresholds helps farmers select their seed and field management strategies as part of their overall risk management. Climate experts may therefore aim to assist farm planning by providing information about the climate change-induced shifts to the expected frequency of daily heat extremes that exceed crop tolerance thresholds.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Adaptation and other changes in societies and environment can shift climatic thresholds by modifying vulnerability and exposure. For example, adaptation efforts may include breeding new crops with higher heat tolerance levels so that corresponding dangerous thresholds occur less frequently. Likewise, increasing the height of a flood embankment protecting a given community can increase the level of river flow that may be tolerated without flooding, reducing the frequency of damaging floods. Stakeholders therefore benefit from climate services that are based on a co-development process, with scientists identifying system-relevant thresholds and developing tailored climatic impact-driver indices that represent these thresholds (FAQ 12.1). These thresholds help focus the provision of action-relevant climate information for adaptation and risk management.</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 12.2, Figure </span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">1 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Crop response to maximum temperature thresholds. </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>Crop growth rate responds to daily maximum temperature increases, leading to reduced growth and crop failure as temperatures exceed critical and limiting temperature thresholds, respectively.

By examining each of these aspects of a hazard’s profile change, climate services may provide climate risk information that allows decision makers to better tailor adaptation, mitigation and risk management strategies.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">A <span class="Standard-italic">climate hazard</span> is a climate condition with the potential to harm natural systems or society. Examples include heatwaves, droughts, heavy snowfall events and sea level rise. Climate scientists look for patterns in climatic impact-drivers to detect the signature of changing hazards that may influence stakeholder planning (FAQ 12.1). Climate service providers work with stakeholders and impacts experts to identify key system responses and tolerance thresholds (FAQ 12.2) and then examine historical observations and future climate projections to identify associated changes to the characteristics of a regional hazard’s profile. Climate change can alter at least five different characteristics of the hazard profile of a region (FAQ 12.3, Figure 1):</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US"><span class="Standard-italic">Magnitude or intensity</span> is the raw value of a climate hazard, such as an increase in the maximum yearly temperature or in the height of flooding that results from a coastal storm with a 1% change of occurring each year.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US"><span class="Standard-italic">Frequency</span> is the number of times that a climate hazard reaches or surpasses a threshold over a given period. For example, increases to the number of heavy snowfall events, tornadoes, or floods experienced in a year or in a decade.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US"><span class="Standard-italic">Duration</span> is the length of time over which hazardous conditions persist beyond a threshold, such as an increase in the number of consecutive days where maximum air temperature exceeds 35°C, the number of consecutive months of drought conditions, or the number of days that a tropical cyclone affects a location.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US"><span class="Standard-italic">Timing</span>captures the occurrence of a hazardous event in relation to the course of a day, season, year, or other period in which sectoral elements are evolving or co-dependent (such as the time of year when migrating animals expect to find a seasonal food supply). Examples include a shift towards an earlier day of the year when the last spring frost occurs or a delay in the typical arrival date for the first seasonal rains, the length of the winter period when the ground is typically covered by snow, or a reduction in the typical time needed for soil moisture to move from normal to drought conditions.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US"><span class="Standard-italic">Spatial extent </span> is the region in which a hazardous condition is expected, such as the area currently threatened by tropical cyclones, geographical areas where the coldest day of the year restricts a particular pest or pathogen, terrain where permafrost is present, the area that would flood following a common storm, zones where climate conditions are conducive to outdoor labour, or the size of a marine heatwave.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Hazard profile changes are often intertwined or stem from related physical changes to the climate system. For example, changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events are often directly related to each other as a result of atmospheric dynamics and chemical processes. In many cases, one aspect of hazard change is more apparent than others, which may provide a first emergent signal indicating a larger set of changes to come (FAQ 1.2).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Information about how a hazard has changed or will change helps stakeholders prioritize more robust adaptation, mitigation and risk management strategies. For example, allocation of limited disaster relief resources may be designed to recognize that tropical cyclones are projected to become more intense even as the frequency of those storms may not change. Planning may also factor in the fact that even heatwaves that are not record-breaking in their intensity can still be problematic for vulnerable populations when they persist over a long period. Likewise, firefighters recognize new logistical challenges in the lengthening of the fire weather season and an expansion of fire conditions into parts of the world where fires were not previously a great concern. Strong engagement between climate scientists and stakeholders therefore helps climate services tailor and communicate clear information about the types of changing climate hazards to be addressed in resilience efforts.</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title ParaOverride-5" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">F</span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">AQ 12.3, Figure 1 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Types of changes to a region’s hazard profile. </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>The first five panels illustrate how climate changes can alter a hazard’s intensity (or magnitude), frequency, duration, and timing (by seasonality and speed of onset) in relation to a hazard threshold (horizontal grey line, marked ‘H’).
