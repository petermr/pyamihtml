Chapter 10 assesses the foundations of how regional climate information is distilled from multiple, sometimes contrasting, lines of evidence. Starting from the assessment of global-scale observations in Chapter 2, Chapter 10 assesses the challenges and requirements associated with observations relevant at the regional scale. Chapter 10 also assesses the fitness of modelling tools available for attributing and projecting anthropogenic climate change in a regional context starting from the methodologies assessed in Chapters 3 and 4. Regional climate change is the result of the interplay between regional responses to both natural forcings and human influence (considered in Chapters 2, 5, 6 and 7), responses to large-scale climate phenomena characterizing internal variability (considered in Chapters 1–9), and processes and feedbacks of a regional nature.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">(Chapter 10 is the first of four chapters that assess regional-scale information in this Report. The region-by-region assessment of past and future changes in extremes (Chapter 11), climatic impact-drivers (Chapter 12) and mean climate (Atlas) relies on the sources and methodologies used for constructing regional climate change information assessed in Chapter 10.

It is also key for improving the boundary conditions for dynamical downscaling and the input for statistical approaches, in particular when regional climate change is strongly influenced by large-scale circulation changes. Increasing resolution per se does not solve all performance limitations. Including the relevant forcings (e.g., aerosols, land-use change and stratospheric ozone concentrations) and representing the relevant feedbacks (e.g., snow–albedo, soil-moisture–temperature, soil-moisture–precipitation) in global and regional models is a prerequisite for reproducing historical regional trends and ensuring fitness for future projections (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>).

Chapter 10 assesses the sources and methodologies used by the Chapters 11, 12 and <a class="section-link" data-title="Atlas" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/atlas">Atlas</a> to construct regional information. Chapter 10 builds on the assessment of methodologies considered to construct global climate change information in Chapters 2 to 4 and on the processes assessed in Chapters 5 to 9.

It can also refer to a change in temporal properties such as persistence and frequency of occurrence of weather and climate extreme events. Regional climate change may be caused by natural internal processes such as atmospheric internal variability and local climate response to low-frequency modes of climate variability (Technical Annex IV), as well as by changes in external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycle, orbital forcing, volcanic eruptions, and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use and land cover (Cross-Chapter Box 3.2; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018a">IPCC, 2018a</a>), in addition to the interactions and feedbacks between them. Process interaction in space is pervasive, which means that small spatial scales often have an influence on the larger scales (<a class="reference-link" href="#Palmer--2013">Palmer, 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sandu--2016">Sandu et al., 2016</a>). Depending on the context, a region may refer to a large area such as a monsoon region, but may also be confined to smaller areas such as coastlines, mountain ranges or human settlements like cities. Users (understood as anyone incorporating climate information into their activity) often request climate information for these range of scales since their operating and adaptation decision scales range from the local to the sub-continental level.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.1.1_p3">Given the many types of regional climates, the broad range of spatial and temporal scales (<a class="section-link" data-title="Regional Climate Change and the Relevant Spatial and Temporal Scales" href="#10.1.2">Section 10.1.2</a>), and the diversity of user needs, a variety of methodologies and approaches have been developed to construct regional climate change information. The sources include global and regional climate model simulations, statistical downscaling and bias adjustment methods. A commonly used source is long-term (end-of-century) model projections of regional climate change, as well as near-term (next 10 years) climate predictions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kushnir--2019">Kushnir et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#R%C3%B6ssler--2019a">Rössler et al., 2019a</a>).

High-quality observations that enable monitoring of the regional aspects of climate are used to adjust inherent model biases and are the basis for assessing model performance.

Because only one realization of the actual climate exists, it is non-trivial to extract estimates of internal and forced variability from the available data (<a class="reference-link" href="#Frankcombe--2015">Frankcombe et al., 2015</a>). As an alternative, approaches that use large observational ensembles can be applied (<a class="section-link" data-title="Interplay Between Anthropogenic Change and Internal Variability at Regional Scales" href="#10.4">Section 10.4</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McKinnon--2018">McKinnon and Deser, 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.1.2.2_p3">There is a close relationship between spatial and temporal scales (Figure 10.3).

These scales interact and the interactions are represented in climate models, although the ability of current models to simulate regional phenomena and even large-scale climate drivers still leaves room for improvement (<a class="section-link" data-title="Using Models for Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="#10.3">Section 10.3</a>) and limits their capability to represent the interactions across spatial and temporal scales.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.1.2.2_p4">It is important to note that in this chapter and subsequent regional chapters, including the Interactive Atlas, the baselines and reference periods used for climate change estimates from regional models may vary from those used in Chapters 1 to 9. In these chapters three main time baselines are defined for the past, for example, pre-industrial (before 1750), early industrial (1850–1900) and recent (1995–2014), while the future reference periods are 2021–2040 (near term), 2041–2060 (mid-term) and 2081–2100 (long term) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Baselines, Reference Periods and Anomalies" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.4.1">Section 1.4.1</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 1.2). Regional climate simulations used in the recent literature have been performed with different baselines. The differences are often due to the availability of the boundary conditions from global simulations, leading to periods chosen for those simulations like 1950–2005, in line with the CMIP5 historical simulations followed by projections from 2005 onwards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vaittinada%20Ayar--2016">Vaittinada Ayar et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2017">Zhang et al., 2017</a>; L. <a class="reference-link" href="#Cai--2018"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Cai--2018">Cai et al., 2018</a>). For simulations that use CMIP3 boundary conditions other periods have been used. As a consequence, these regional simulations mix for the recent period historical simulations with projections. The mismatch needs to be considered when assessing results obtained from both global and regional models in the context of the climate information distillation process, or when linking the regional chapters to the assessments performed in previous chapters. The choice of baseline provides a source of uncertainty for the assessment of climate impacts (e.g., for the response of bird species in Africa; <a class="reference-link" href="#Baker--2016">Baker et al., 2016</a>). Besides, a range of different baselines may need to be considered to satisfy a variety of users, since this choice affects the perceived result (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dobor--2019">Dobor and Hlásny, 2019</a>). The influence of the different baseline periods can be explored using the Interactive <a class="section-link" data-title="Atlas" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/atlas">Atlas</a> where different baselines are available, for example, 1986–2005 (according to AR5), 1995–2014 (this Report), and both 1961–1990 and 1981–2010 (WMO).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.1.2.2_p5">One way of overcoming the baseline uncertainty is to define the results for a given model based on specific global mean temperature changes from the pre-industrial period (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Sylla--2018">Sylla et al., 2018</a> for West Africa; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kjellstr%C3%B6m--2018">Kjellström et al., 2018</a> for Europe; <a class="reference-link" href="#Taylor--2018">Taylor et al., 2018</a> for the Caribbean; <a class="reference-link" href="#Montroull--2018">Montroull et al., 2018</a> for South America). The specific global mean temperature is known as global warming level (GWL; Sections 1.6.2 and 10.6.4, and Cross-Chapter Box 11.1). The GWL is a useful dimension of integration because important changes in regional climate, including many types of extremes, scale quasi-linearly with the GWLs, often independently of the underlying emissions scenarios (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Hoegh-Guldberg--2018">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Beusch--2020">Beusch et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2020">Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020</a>), always taking into account caveats described in Cross-Chapter Box 11.1.

These uncertainty estimates are then propagated in the distillation process to generate climate information.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.1.3.3_p2">Uncertainties in model-based future regional climate information arise from different sources and are introduced at various stages in the process (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lehner--2020">Lehner et al., 2020</a>): (i) forcing uncertainties associated with the future scenario or pathway that is assumed; (ii) internal variability; and (iii) uncertainties related to imperfections in climate models, also referred to as structural or model uncertainty. However, the relative role of each of these sources of uncertainty differs between the global and the regional scales as well as between variables and also between different regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lehner--2020">Lehner et al., 2020</a>). One way to address the internal variability and model uncertainties is to consider results from both multiple models and multiple realizations of the same model (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eyring--2016a">Eyring et al., 2016a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lehner--2020">Lehner et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#D%C3%ADaz--2021">Díaz et al., 2021</a>). These models are at times also combined with different weights that are a function of their performance and independence to increase the confidence of the multi-model ensemble (<a class="reference-link" href="#Abramowitz--2019">Abramowitz et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Brunner--2019">Brunner et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.1.3.3_p3">Other elements that play a role are the inconsistency between the global and regional models in dynamical downscaling or the observational and methodological uncertainty in bias-adjustment methods (<a class="reference-link" href="#S%C3%B8rland--2018">Sørland et al., 2018</a>). These elements, in addition to those typical of the uncertainty in global and large-scale phenomena (Chapters 1–9), affect the overall confidence of regional climate information. This complex scene with different sources of uncertainty makes the collection of results available from multi-model, multi-member simulations most useful when synthesized through a distillation process (<a class="section-link" data-title="Distillation of Climate Information" href="#10.5.3">Section 10.5.3</a>).</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="10.1.4"><h2 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">10.1.4 Distillation of Regional Climate Information<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-7-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.1.4_p1">Regional climate information is synthesized from different lines of evidence from a number of sources (Sections 10.2–10.4) taking into account the context of a user vulnerable to climate variability and change at regional scales (<a class="reference-link" href="#Baztan--2017">Baztan et al., 2017</a>) and the values of all relevant actors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Corner--2014">Corner et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bessette--2017">Bessette et al., 2017</a>) in a process called distillation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Combining Approaches to Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="#10.5">Section 10.5</a>). Distillation, understood as the process of synthesizing information about climate change from different lines of evidence obtained from a variety of sources and taking into account the user context and the values of all relevant actors, allows the connection of global climate change to the local and regional scales, where adaptation responses and policy decisions take place. Climate information is translated into the user context in a co-production process that introduces further user-relevant elements leading to user-relevant climate information (Figure 10.1; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pettenger--2016">Pettenger, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Verrax--2017">Verrax, 2017</a>) for a specific demand like, for instance, guiding climate-resilient development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kruk--2017">Kruk et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Parker--2019">Parker and Lusk, 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.1.4_p2">The approaches adopted in the distillation of regional climate information are diverse and range from the simple delivery of data as information to co-production with the user using as many lines of evidence as possible (<a class="reference-link" href="#Louren%C3%A7o--2016">Lourenço et al., 2016</a>). The availability and selection of the sources and the approach followed has implications for the usefulness of the information. For instance, it is well-established that it is invalid to take a time series from a gridcell of a model simulation as equivalent to an observational estimate of a point within the cell, due to the lack of representativeness (<a class="section-link" data-title="Using Models for Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="#10.3">Section 10.3</a>), and consequently the information building solely on this type of data source is of limited use. Relevant decisions are made during the distillation process, such as what method is most suitable to a specific user context and the question being addressed. The information may be provided in the form of summarized raw data, a set of user-oriented indicators, a set of figures and maps with either a brief description, in the form of a storyline, or formulated as rich and complex climate adaptation plans.

Notably, at the time of AR5, many studies still relied on global datasets, models, and assessment methods to inform regional decisions, which were not considered as effective as tailored regional approaches.

Conversely, in the ‘bottom-up’ approach the development context is the starting point, focusing on local scales, and layers climate change on top of this.

This may cause weather systems to travel eastward more slowly and thus, all other things being equal, Arctic amplification could lead to more persistent weather patterns over the mid-latitudes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Francis--2012">Francis and Vavrus, 2012</a>). The persistent large meandering flow may increase the likelihood of connected patterns of temperature and precipitation climatic impact-drivers because they frequently occur when atmospheric circulation patterns are persistent, which tends to occur with a strong meridional wind component. Another possible consequence of Arctic warming is on the NAO/AO that shows a negative trend over the 1990s and early 2000s (<a class="reference-link" href="#Robson--2016">Robson et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Iles--2017">Iles and Hegerl, 2017</a>), and has been linked to the reduction of sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas, and the increase in Eurasian snow cover (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cohen--2012">Cohen et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nakamura--2015">Nakamura et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yang--2016">Yang et al., 2016</a>).

However, regional reanalyses are valuable for regional climate assessments, since they can employ high-resolution model simulations due to their limited spatial domain. Their accuracy is also better than global reanalyses since they are often developed over regions with a high density of observational data (sometimes not freely available for all regions) to be assimilated into the model (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Yamada--2012">Yamada et al., 2012</a>). Regional reanalyses can assimilate locally dense and high-frequency observations, such as from local observation networks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mahmood--2018">Mahmood et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Su--2019">Su et al., 2019</a>) and radar precipitation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wahl--2017">Wahl et al., 2017</a>) in addition to the observations assimilated by global reanalyses.

The periods of regional reanalyses are limited by the availability of the observations for assimilation and by the global reanalyses needed as lateral boundary conditions. Most regional reanalyses cover the past 10 to 30 years. There are also regional reanalysis activities that use conventional observations only, which produce consistent datasets over 60 years to capture precipitation trends, extremes and changes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fukui--2018">Fukui et al., 2018</a>).

Data quality assessment is key for ensuring that the data are credible and to establish trusted relationships between the data provider and the users (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nightingale--2019">Nightingale et al., 2019</a>). QC is performed for all relevant global climate datasets (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Menne--2018">Menne et al., 2018</a>). For instance, QC informs users that old reanalysis datasets can be inconsistent in the long term because they assimilated inhomogeneous observations over the reanalyses period (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kobayashi--2015">Kobayashi et al., 2015</a>).

Recent studies suggest that our ability to remove biases quickly diminishes for sparse networks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gubler--2017">Gubler et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lindau--2018a">Lindau and Venema, 2018a</a>). This affects early instrumental data and observations that are not strongly correlated between stations, such as wind and humidity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chimani--2018">Chimani et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.2.2.2_p4">Second, in addition to systematic errors, homogenized data also suffer from random errors, introduced by the homogenization process. These errors are largest at the station level but are also present in network-averaged signals (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lindau--2018b">Lindau and Venema, 2018b</a>). These errors are determined by the break time series, as well as the noise series and the performance of the homogenization method, are spatially correlated, and have an impact on activities such as interpolation and statistical post-processing of climate simulations (<a class="section-link" data-title="Observations for Calibrating Statistical Methods" href="#10.2.3.1">Section 10.2.3.1</a>). Third, the above discussion pertains to the homogenization of monthly and annual means. Homogenization of daily variability around the mean is more difficult. For daily data, specific correction methods are used (<a class="reference-link" href="#Della-Marta--2006">Della-Marta and Wanner, 2006</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mestre--2011">Mestre et al., 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Trewin--2013">Trewin, 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhou--2021"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhou--2021">C. Zhou et al., 2021</a>) that are able to improve the homogeneity of test cases, although recent independent validation efforts were not able to show much improvement (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chimani--2018">Chimani et al., 2018</a>). The difference with homogenization methods of monthly and annual means may stem from assumptions on the nature of inhomogeneities for daily data, which are not yet well understood (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chimani--2018">Chimani et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.2.2.2_p5">It is <i class="•-Condensed-italic">virtually certain</i> that statistical homogenization methods reduce the uncertainties of long-term estimates. Considering a decomposition of the long-term warming error into a bias and a noise uncertainty around the bias, the (trend) bias especially will be reduced, but also most of the noise uncertainty. This conclusion is based on our understanding of the causes of inhomogeneities and their statistical nature combined with the design principles of statistical homogenization methods, as well as on analytical (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lindau--2018b">Lindau and Venema, 2018b</a>), numerical (<a class="reference-link" href="#Venema--2012">Venema et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Williams--2012">Williams et al., 2012</a>) and empirical validation studies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hausfather--2016">Hausfather et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gubler--2017">Gubler et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Killick--2020">Killick et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.2.2.2_p6">The above section is about the homogenization of land stations.

This is particularly problematic when trying to assess regional climate change, for which a high density of observational data is desirable. Although in several regions numerous stations provide (monthly) data covering more than 100 years for both temperature and precipitation (<a class="reference-link" href="#GCOS--2015">GCOS, 2015</a>), large areas of the world remain sparsely covered. The post-1990 decline in the total number of stations contributing to the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) monthly product may be related to delays in data acquisition and not paucity of data (<a class="reference-link" href="#GCOS--2015">GCOS, 2015</a>). This is because GPCC is the result of a single time scale, single Essential Climate Variable (ECV) and single data collection centre. There is no similar drop-off of the rainfall reports in the Global Historical Climatology Network Daily database (GHCNd, <a class="reference-link" href="#Menne--2012">Menne et al., 2012</a>) or the Integrated Surface Database (ISD) at the sub-daily time scale.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.2.2.3_p2"><a class="reference-link" href="#Kidd--2017">Kidd et al. (2017)</a> made some assumptions about GPCC-available gauges and indicated that only 1.6% of Earth’s surface lies within 10 km of a rain gauge, and many areas of the world are beyond 100 km from the nearest rain gauge. Data scarcity is especially critical over Africa (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nikulin--2012">Nikulin et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dike--2018">Dike et al., 2018</a>) but the apparent data scarcity could be due to reasons other than actual paucity of data, as stated earlier. For instance, over South Africa, the number of weather stations collecting daily temperature used in the fourth version of the Climatic Research Unit Temperature dataset (CRUTEM4, <a class="reference-link" href="#Osborn--2014">Osborn and Jones, 2014</a>) has significantly declined since 1980 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Archer--2018">Archer et al., 2018</a>). Although CRUTEM4 has now been replaced by CRUTEM5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Osborn--2021">Osborn et al., 2021</a>) it has yet to take advantage of the significant international efforts to curate and make available improved global holdings (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rennie--2014">Rennie et al., 2014</a>) which increased the global available station count for monthly mean temperatures. This includes additional stations from many African countries. The apparent decline in stations since the 1980s could also be due to countries not contributing their data to the SYNOP/CLIMAT networks for reasons other than having non-operational stations.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.2.2.3_p3">Even in Europe, precipitation station density in the widely used E-OBS gridded dataset varies largely in space and time across regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Prein--2017">Prein and Gobiet, 2017</a>). This variability is partly due to the reluctance of some data owners to share their data with an international effort. Regardless of the reason, low station density is a major source of uncertainty (<a class="reference-link" href="#Isotta--2015">Isotta et al., 2015</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Kirchengast--2014">Kirchengast et al. (2014)</a> and <a class="reference-link" href="#O--2019">O and Foelsche (2019)</a> found that at least 2 to 5 (12) stations are required for capturing the area-averaged precipitation amount of heavy summer precipitation events on a daily (hourly) basis with a normalized root-mean-square error of less than 20%. Like the E-OBS dataset, gridded daily temperature and precipitation datasets are being developed for other regions of the world. Examples include south-east Asia (SA-OBS, <a class="reference-link" href="#Van%20den%20Besselaar--2017">Van den Besselaar et al., 2017</a>), and Latin America and West Africa (ICA&amp;D, Van den <a class="reference-link" href="#Besselaar--2015">Besselaar et al., 2015</a>). Despite the uneven distribution of stations in space and time, the value in these initiatives is illustrated by the large number of studies in which the data product is used. This is the case, for instance, in the work of <a class="reference-link" href="#Condom--2020">Condom et al.

There have been efforts to reduce data scarcity through initiatives such as the International Surface Temperature Initiative (ISTI, <a class="reference-link" href="#Thorne--2011">Thorne et al., 2011</a>), GHCND, and the Expanding Met Office Hadley Centre ISD with quality-controlled, sub-daily station data from 1931 (HadISD, <a class="reference-link" href="#Dunn--2016">Dunn et al., 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.2.2.3_p4">Data scarcity arising from changing coverage in observation station networks results in substantial problems for climate monitoring (e.g., trend analysis of extreme events requires high temporal and spatial resolutions) or model evaluation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Evaluation Diagnostics" href="#10.3.3.1">Section 10.3.3.1</a>). It is <i class="•-Condensed-italic">virtually certain</i> that the scarcity and decline of observational availability in some regions (but not necessarily globally), increase the uncertainty of the long-term global temperature and precipitation estimates. As an example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Lin--2019">Lin and Huybers (2019)</a> found that changes in the number of rain gauges after 1975 resulted in spurious trends in extremes of Indian rainfall in a 0.25° gridded dataset spanning the 20th century.

Ideally, bias adjustment is calibrated against area-averaged data of the same spatial scale as the climate model output. Hence, high-quality observed gridded datasets with an effective resolution close to the nominal model resolution are required. Driven by the need to also generate regional-scale information in station-sparse regions, researchers have considered derived datasets that blend in situ and remote-sensing data to produce high-resolution observations to be used as predictands (Sections 10.2.1.2 and 10.2.2.4; <a class="reference-link" href="#Haiden--2011">Haiden et al., 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wilby--2013">Wilby and Yu, 2013</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="10.2.3.2"><h3 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">10.2.3.2 Observation for Paleoclimate Data Assimilation<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-15-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.2.3.2_p1">Following some early concept studies, the first practical applications of paleoclimate data assimilation over past centuries used only selected data to reconstruct past climate changes for analysis of a specific process or case (<a class="reference-link" href="#Widmann--2010">Widmann et al., 2010</a>).

The effective resolution, for which the shape of the kinetic energy spectrum is simulated correctly, is about three to five times larger (<a class="reference-link" href="#Klaver--2020">Klaver et al., 2020</a>), and a similar relationship also applies to RCMs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Skamarock--2004">Skamarock, 2004</a>).

In particular, extreme events are often caused by specific, in some cases persistent, circulation patterns (Sections 11.3–11.7). It is therefore important for climate models to reasonably represent not only continental, but also regional climate and its variability for such extremes. As explained in <a class="section-link" data-title="Atmospheric Circulation" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-3#3.3.3">Section 3.3.3</a>, standard resolution global models can suffer biases in the location, occurrence frequency or intensity of large-scale phenomena, such that statements about a specific regional climate and its change can be highly uncertain (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hall--2014">Hall, 2014</a>). RCMs have difficulties improving especially large-scale circulation biases, although some successful examples exist. But due to their enhanced representation of complex topography and coastlines, RCMs may add value to simulating the regional expression of teleconnections. Bias adjustment cannot mitigate fundamental misrepresentations of the large-scale atmospheric circulation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Maraun--2017">Maraun et al., 2017</a>, Cross-Chapter Box 10.2).

Given their importance in shaping mean and extreme regional climate (Sections 3.3.3.3, 11.3 and 11.4), an accurate representation of blocking and extratropical cyclones in global and regional climate models is needed to better understand regional climate variability and extremes as well as to project future changes (<a class="section-link" data-title="Extratropical Storms" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11#11.7.2">Section 11.7.2</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Grotjahn--2016">Grotjahn et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mitchell--2017">Mitchell et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rohrer--2018">Rohrer et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Huguenin--2020">Huguenin et al., 2020</a>).

Current global model ensembles reproduce global to continental-scale surface temperature trends at multi-decadal to centennial time scales (CMIP5, CMIP6), but underestimate precipitation trends (CMIP5) (Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2). For regional trends, AR5 concluded that the CMIP5 ensemble cannot be taken as a reliable representation of reality and that the true uncertainty can be larger than the simulated model spread (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kirtman--2014">Kirtman et al., 2014</a>). Case studies of regional trend simulations by global models can be found in Sections 10.4.1 and 10.6, and region-by-region assessments in the Atlas. A key limitation for assessing the representation of regional observed trends by single transient simulations of global models (or downscaled versions thereof) is the strong amplitude of internal variability compared to the forced signal at the regional scale (<a class="section-link" data-title="Role of Internal Variability" href="#10.3.4.3">Section 10.3.4.3</a>).

The performance was similar for the different methods, indicating the importance of choosing informative predictors. Similarly, Maraun et al.

In particular, the credibility of downscaled information depends on the quality of both the downscaling method and of the global model providing the large-scale boundary conditions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Flato--2014">Flato et al., 2014</a>).

The required level of model fitness may depend on the user context (<a class="section-link" data-title="Combining Approaches to Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="#10.5">Section 10.5</a>).

Thus, the key to assessing the fitness-for-purpose of a model is the evaluation of how relevant processes controlling regional climate are represented (<a class="reference-link" href="#Collins--2018">Collins et al., 2018</a>). A process-based evaluation may be more appropriate than an evaluation of the variables of interest (e.g., temperature, precipitation), because biases in the latter may in principle be reduced if the underlying processes are realistically simulated (Cross-Chapter Box 10.2), while individual variables may appear as well-represented because of compensating errors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Flato--2014">Flato et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Baumberger--2017">Baumberger et al., 2017</a>). Combining a process-based evaluation with a mechanistic explanation of projected changes further increases confidence in projections (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bukovsky--2017">Bukovsky et al., 2017</a>). Fitness-for-purpose can also be assessed by comparing the simulated response of a model with simulations of higher resolution models that better represent relevant processes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Baumberger--2017">Baumberger et al., 2017</a>).

The idea is to link the spread in climate model projections via regression to the spread in present climate model biases for relevant driving processes.

For instance, <a class="reference-link" href="#Simpson--2016">Simpson et al.

In addition to providing information on internal variability, ensembles of simulations can estimate scenario uncertainty and model (structural) uncertainty. Chapter 4, especially Box 4.1, discusses issues involved with evaluating ensembles of global model simulations and their uncertainties. In a downscaling context, further considerations are necessary, such as the selection of global model–RCM combinations when performing dynamical downscaling. This is a relevant issue when resources are limited. The structural uncertainty of both the global model and the downscaling method can be important (e.g., Mearnset al., 2012; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dosio--2017">Dosio, 2017</a>), as well as further potential uncertainty created by inconsistencies between the global model and the downscaling method (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Dosio--2019">Dosio et al., 2019</a>), which could include, for example, differences in topography or the way to model precipitation processes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mearns--2013">Mearns et al., 2013</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.3.4.4_p2">An important consideration is which set of global models should be used for global model–RCM combinations. If adequate resources exist, then large numbers of global model–RCM combinations are possible (<a class="reference-link" href="#D%C3%A9qu%C3%A9--2012">Déqué et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Coppola--2021">Coppola et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Vautard--2021">Vautard et al., 2021</a>). However, coordinated downscaling programmes can be limited by the human and computational resources available, for producing ensembles of downscaled output, which limits the number of feasible global model–RCM combinations. With this limitation in mind, a small set of GCMs may be chosen that span the range of equilibrium climate sensitivity in available global models (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Mearns--2012">Mearns et al., 2012</a>, 2013; <a class="reference-link" href="#Inatsu--2015">Inatsu et al., 2015</a>), though this range may be inconsistent with the likely range (Chapter 4), or some other relevant measure of sensitivity, such as the projected range of tropical SSTs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Suzuki-Parker--2018">Suzuki-Parker et al., 2018</a>). A further choice is to emphasize models that do not have the same origins or that do not use similar parametrizations and thus might be viewed as independent, a criterion that could be applied to both global models (Chapter 4) and RCMs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Evans--2014">Evans et al., 2014</a>). Global models and RCMs could also be discarded that unrealistically represent processes controlling the regional climate of interest (<a class="reference-link" href="#McSweeney--2015">McSweeney et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Maraun--2017">Maraun et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bukovsky--2019">Bukovsky et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Eyring--2019">Eyring et al., 2019</a>). Box 4.1 offers a more detailed discussion of the issues surrounding these approaches. Finally, global models may be selected to represent different physically self-consistent changes in regional climate (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zappa--2017">Zappa and Shepherd, 2017</a>). Statistical methods can provide estimates of outcomes from missing global model–RCM combinations in a large matrix (<a class="reference-link" href="#D%C3%A9qu%C3%A9--2012">Déqué et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Heinrich--2014">Heinrich et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Evin--2019">Evin et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.3.4.4_p3">However, even using a relatively small set of global models can still involve substantial computation that strains available resources, both for performing the simulations and for using all simulations in the ensemble for further impacts assessment. The NARCCAP programme (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mearns--2012">Mearns et al., 2012</a>) used only a subset of its possible global model–RCM combinations that balanced comprehensiveness of sampling the matrix with economy of computation demand, while still allowing discrimination, via ANOVA methods, of global model and RCM influences on regional climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mearns--2013">Mearns et al., 2013</a>). An advantage of the sparse, but balanced matrix for those using the downscaling output for further studies, is that they have a smaller, yet comprehensive set of global model–RCM combinations to work with. Alternatively, data-clustering methods can clump together downscaling simulations featuring similar climate-change characteristics, so that only one representative simulation from each cluster may be needed for further impacts analysis, again systematically reducing the necessary number of simulations to work with (Mendlik andGobiet, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wilcke--2016">Wilcke and Bärring, 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.3.4.4_p4">Independently of the resources, participation of multiple models in a simulation programme such as CORDEX for RCMs or CMIP for global models creates ensembles of opportunity, which are ensembles populated by models that participants chose to use without there necessarily being an overarching guiding principle for an optimum choice. As discussed in Chapter 4, these ensembles are likely suboptimal for assessing sources of uncertainty. An important contributor to the suboptimal character of such an ensemble is that the models are not independent. Some may also have larger biases than others. Yet often, the output from models in these ensembles has received equal weight when viewed collectively, as was the case in much of the AR5 assessment (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Collins--2013b">Collins et al., 2013b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Knutti--2013">Knutti et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Flato--2014">Flato et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kirtman--2014">Kirtman et al., 2014</a>).

Since AR5, methods using spatiotemporal information have been further developed and used to improve the separation between external and internal drivers in multiple or single historical climate realizations performed by a given global model.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.4.1.2_p2">The typical ensemble size of CMIP historical climate simulations for a given model traditionally range between one and ten members, with three often being the default choice.

The low-frequency component analysis method tries to find low-frequency variability patterns by searching for linear combinations of a moderate number of empirical orthogonal functions that maximize the ratio of low-frequency to total variance. It has first been used to separate internal modes of interannual and decadal variability from slowly varying and externally-forced variability in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wills--2018">Wills et al., 2018</a>, 2019).

Typically, the non-linear anthropogenic trend (e.g., of 20th-century temperature) can be reconstructed by summing the long-term mean, the residual, and eventually the lowest-frequency mode to account for a multi-decadal forced signal, for instance associated with anthropogenic aerosol forcing.

The subsequent reduction in aerosol emissions then led to North Atlantic warming and recovery of Sahel rainfall. Such mechanisms continue into the near-term future in idealized and modified RCP experiments, with scenarios featuring more aggressive reductions in aerosol emissions, or including aerosol–cloud interactions, favouring a greater northward shift of rainfall (<a class="reference-link" href="#Allen--2015">Allen, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Westervelt--2017">Westervelt et al., 2017</a>, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Scannell--2019">Scannell et al., 2019</a>).

However, the main features of summer mean precipitation and variability of South America are still not well-represented in all CMIP5 and CMIP6 models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gulizia--2015">Gulizia and Camilloni, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#D%C3%ADaz--2017">Díaz and Vera, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#D%C3%ADaz--2021">Díaz et al., 2021</a>). This motivates the construction of ensembles that exclude the worst performing models (<a class="section-link" data-title="Performance at Simulating Regional Phenomena and Processes" href="#10.3.3.4">Section 10.3.3.4</a>). The construction of ensembles of CMIP5 historical simulations with realistic representation of precipitation anomalies with opposite sign over south-eastern South America and eastern Brazil showed that the trend since the 1950s could be related to changes in precipitation characteristics only when simulations included anthropogenic forcings (<a class="reference-link" href="#D%C3%ADaz--2017">Díaz and Vera, 2017</a>). GHG emissions have been related to increased precipitation in south-eastern South America through three different mechanisms (Figure 10.12a). First, GHG warming induces a non-zonally uniform pattern of SST warming that includes a warming pattern over the Indian and Pacific oceans that excites wave responses over South America (<a class="reference-link" href="#Junquas--2013">Junquas et al., 2013</a>). Zonally uniform SST patterns of warming alone lead to precipitation signals opposite to those observed in an AGCM (<a class="reference-link" href="#Junquas--2013">Junquas et al., 2013</a>). Second, GHG radiative forcing drives an expansion of the Hadley cell so that its descending branch moves poleward from the region, generating anomalous ascending motion and precipitation (H. <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2016"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2016"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2016">Zhang et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Saurral--2019">Saurral et al., 2019</a>). The third mechanism by which increased GHG can contribute to increased precipitation in the region is through a delay of the stratospheric polar vortex breakdown. As depicted in Figure 10.12a, both stratospheric ozone depletion and increased GHGs have contributed to the later breakdown of the polar vortex in recent decades (<a class="reference-link" href="#McLandress--2010">McLandress et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wu--2017">Wu and Polvani, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ceppi--2019">Ceppi and </a><a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2019">Shepherd, 2019</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Mindlin--2020">Mindlin et al.

Out of the 12 large ensembles examined (with ensemble size varying in the 16–100 range), only seven simulated the observed trend within their range. This could partly be explained by model biases in mean precipitation and its interannual variability. In the sub-ensemble of six models that reproduce reasonably well the observed spatial patterns of mean precipitation and interannual variability, the ensemble mean spread is lower, and the forced response, taken as the multi-model ensemble mean, is slightly more positive than that of the six poorly performing models. The signal-to-noise ratio, estimated as the ratio of the forced response to the spread due to internal variability, is also slightly higher for the best-performing models, suggesting that selecting the best-performing models may have an influence on both attribution of the observed trend and emergence of the forced response in future (<a class="section-link" data-title="Future Regional Changes: Robustness and Emergence of the Anthropogenic Signal" href="#10.4.3">Section 10.4.3</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.4.2.2_p6">There is <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> that South-Eastern South America summer precipitation has increased since the beginning of the 20th century.

There is some evidence suggesting that the Last Glacial Maximum, a period of low atmospheric CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub>, about 21 ka ago, has a thermodynamically-driven zonal mean precipitation response similar to that of the current state with relatively high CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> levels when compared with the pre-industrial period. Pluvial conditions at that time and a reduction in precipitation from the Last Glacial Maximum to the pre-industrial period are consistent with drying trends for the region in models with GHG concentrations exceeding pre-industrial levels. However, the dominant large-scale drivers responsible for the precipitation changes observed during these two transitions are markedly different: mainly ice-sheet retreat and increasing insolation on one hand, increasing GHGs on the other hand. This suggests that the Last Glacial Maximum correspondence is fortuitous which strongly limits its use to capture future hydrological cycle changes (<a class="section-link" data-title="North American Monsoon" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-8#8.3.2.4.4">Section 8.3.2.4.4</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Morrill--2018">Morrill et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lowry--2019">Lowry and Morrill, 2019</a>).

Droughts are characterized by deficits in total soil moisture content that can be caused by a combination of decreasing precipitation and warming temperature, which promotes greater evapotranspiration.

A cold state of the tropical Pacific would lead by well-established atmospheric teleconnections to anomalous high pressure across the North Pacific and southern North America, favouring a weaker jet stream and a diversion of the Pacific storm track away from the south-west (<a class="reference-link" href="#Delworth--2015">Delworth et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Seager--2017">Seager and Ting, 2017</a>).

Pattern-scaling assumes that the spatial patterns of regional change, often based on a time-averaged 20- or 30-year period at the end of the 21st century, are roughly constant in time, and simply scale linearly with global mean warming. The time-shift approach defines a target in terms of global warming level (GWL) and locates the time segment, usually 20 or 30 years, in historical or scenario simulations in which global mean warming matches the required GWL (<a class="section-link" data-title="Regional Climate Change and the Relevant Spatial and Temporal Scales" href="#10.1.2">Section 10.1.2</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 11.1). Physical consistency between multiple variables and space-time co-variance are fully preserved in the time-shift approach, which is not the case for pattern-scaling (<a class="reference-link" href="#Herger--2015">Herger et al., 2015</a>). Importantly, pattern scaling cannot account for the non-linearity arising from either interacting quasi-linear processes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chadwick--2013">Chadwick and Good, 2013</a>) and purely non-linear mechanisms, which have been shown to be present in CMIP5 models for high GWL (4°C) and affect precipitation more than temperature at the regional-scale (<a class="section-link" data-title="Non-linearities in Large-scale Atmospheric Circulation and Precipitation" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-8#8.5.3.1">Section 8.5.3.1</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Good--2015">Good et al., 2015</a>, 2016). The time-shift approach can also be used to test whether regional climate change patterns depend on the rate of global mean warming and external forcing pathways, in addition to global warming magnitude. A global evaluation of both approaches in projecting the forced temperature and precipitation response for a highly mitigated scenario based on a moderately mitigated one has been performed using a perfect-model framework (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tebaldi--2018">Tebaldi and Knutti, 2018</a>).

Comparisons between pattern-scaling and time-shift approaches allow assessment of the scalability of the regional climate change signal and the extent to which pattern-scaling assumptions still hold at regional scale for a wide range of GWL. This was the approach followed by <a class="reference-link" href="#Matte--2019">Matte et al. (2019)</a> in their assessment of the scalability of European regional climate projections. Based on EURO-CORDEX projections, they performed a detailed comparison between the pattern scaling and the GWL spatial patterns (GWL range: 1°C, 2°C and 3°C) for different seasons, regional model resolutions, and both temperature and precipitation. High pattern correlation values (greater than 0.9) are found between the scaled pattern and all GWL patterns for temperature.

Robustness of the forced response is based on both significance of the change and model agreement about the sign (direction) of change (Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1; Figure 10.14).

It is noteworthy that most emergence studies implicitly assume model independence (<a class="reference-link" href="#Annan--2017">Annan and Hargreaves, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bo%C3%A9--2018">Boé, 2018</a>; Box 4.1) and therefore sensitivity of emergence results to model selection or weighting is rarely performed (<a class="reference-link" href="#Akhter--2018">Akhter et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.4.3.2_p6">Metrics can vary from a simple signal-to-noise ratio to statistical distributional tests (<a class="reference-link" href="#King--2015">King et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gaetani--2020">Gaetani et al., 2020</a>) and give median estimates and uncertainty bounds for the date (or time of emergence) corresponding to the exceedance of specific thresholds by the emergence metric. Reconciling future emergence results among different studies is challenging due to their many methodological differences including the choice of the reference period, the selected climate models and scenario, the precise definition of signal and noise and the choice of different signal-to-noise thresholds to characterize robust emergence. Contrasting with binary yes/no statements, emergence can also be viewed as a continuous process characterized by an amplitude or level, for example the value of the signal-to-noise ratio, that is a function of time or global warming level.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.4.3.2_p7">Since AR5, the development and production of SMILEs (Sections 4.2.5 and 10.3.4.3) has allowed the assessment of the influence of internal variability on anthropogenic signal emergence. The influence of internal variability, and specifically of the unforced atmospheric circulation, on temperature signal emergence can delay or advance the time of emergence by a decade or two in mid- to high-latitude regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lehner--2017a">Lehner et al., 2017a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Koenigk--2020">Koenigk et al., 2020</a>). Internal variability can also result in small or decreasing decadal to multi-decadal heatwave frequency trends under the historical anthropogenic forcing over most regions, thereby delaying emergence of unprecedented heatwave frequency trends relative to the pre-industrial trend distribution (Sections 11.2–11.3; <a class="reference-link" href="#Perkins-Kirkpatrick--2017">Perkins-Kirkpatrick et al., 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.4.3.2_p8">Regional precipitation future changes are much more impacted by internal variability than their temperature counterpart (<a class="reference-link" href="#Monerie--2017b">Monerie et al., 2017b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dai--2019">Dai and Bloecker, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Singh--2019">Singh and AchutaRao, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#von%20Trentini--2019">von Trentini et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Koenigk--2020">Koenigk et al., 2020</a>). Relative to mean temperature changes, this larger influence of internal variability on mean precipitation changes contributes, among other factors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sarojini--2016">Sarojini et al., 2016</a>), to a much delayed emergence of the forced precipitation response in observations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hawkins--2020">Hawkins et al., 2020</a>). Based on the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble forced with the scenario SSP5-8.5, we assess the future emergence of mean precipitation forced change as a function of GWLs for all AR6 land regions (Figure 10.15a). The methodology is a straightforward adaptation of the standard approach (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hawkins--2012">Hawkins and Sutton, 2012</a>). While the standard method is only based on the signal-to-noise ratio exceedance of a specified threshold (taken as one), the approach used here assumes that grid-point emergence occurs when the forced change is considered robust following the AR6 WGI definition of robustness for projected changes (Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1). At a GWL of 1°C, emergence only occurs in high-latitude regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wan--2015">Wan et al., 2015</a>; R. <a class="reference-link" href="#Guo--2019"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Guo--2019">Guo et al., 2019</a>), albeit with only small (less than 30%) area fraction with robust change. Robust changes in tropical and subtropical regions only appear from GWLs of 1.5°C, for example in south-western South America (<a class="reference-link" href="#Boisier--2016">Boisier et al., 2016</a>), western Africa (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hawkins--2020">Hawkins et al., 2020</a>; <a class="section-link" data-title="The Sahel and West African Monsoon Drought and Recovery" href="#10.4.2.1">Section 10.4.2.1</a>) and southern Australia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Delworth--2014">Delworth and Zeng, 2014</a>). Substantial (taken here simply as area fraction greater than 50%) emergence only occurs in some tropical, subtropical and mid-latitude regions when high GWLs (3°C–4°C) are reached. Importantly, even at these high GWL values, there are still a large number of these regions with robust changes covering less than 50% of their area. In contrast, most high-latitude regions have an area fraction with robust changes greater than 80% at GWLs of 3°C and above.</p><div class="Basic-Text-Frame" id="_idContainer046"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-23" id="figure-10-15" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_10_15.png"></span></strong><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Figure 10.15 </span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Future emergence of anthropogenic signal at regional scale.

Robustness of the precipitation change is first estimated at each grid-point followed by the estimation of the AR6 region area with robust changes. For each Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) model considered (45 models, one member per model, historical simulations and scenario SSP5-8.5), the annual mean precipitation change is based on the difference between a 20-year average centred on the GWL crossing year and the mean precipitation during the pre-industrial period (1850–1900) taken as a reference. The change is considered to be robust when at least 66% of the models (30 out of 45) have a signal-to-noise ratio greater than one and at least 80% of them (36 out of 45) agree on the sign of change. The signal-to-noise ratio is estimated for each model from the ratio between the change and the standard deviation of non-overlapping 20-year means of the corresponding pre-industrial simulation (scaled by square root of 2 times 1.645). <span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> (b) </span>Time evolution of the percentage area of land region with robust annual mean precipitation change for five AR6 land regions.

For each of these AR6 regions, the time evolution of the percentage area with robust annual mean precipitation change is estimated for both the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble and the three coupled SMILEs used throughout Chapter 10. Similarity in percentage area time evolution between CMIP6 and the three coupled SMILEs suggests that internal variability can substantially influence the timing of emergence. For example, internal variability could explain the mid-21st century emergence (percentage area greater than 50%) of the drying and wetting signal over the Mediterranean and South Asia (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Indian Summer Monsoon" href="#10.6.3">Section 10.6.3</a>) regions, respectively. Internal variability can also contribute to the late and moderate emergence over South-Eastern South America (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Regional Climate Change Attribution Examples" href="#10.4.2">Section 10.4.2</a>) and West South Africa (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Cape Town Drought" href="#10.6.2">Section 10.6.2</a>). In contrast, it cannot explain the lack of robust changes (percentage area less than 30%) over Western Africa at the end of the 21st century, suggesting that model differences are also contributing to the lack of emergence (<a class="reference-link" href="#Monerie--2017a">Monerie et al., 2017a</a>, b). In addition to different forced signals, the differences of time evolution between the three SMILEs, in particular for African regions, point to the issue of global model performance in accurately representing internal variability and its future changes. While overestimation and underestimation of internal variability in current models have been reported (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eade--2014">Eade et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Laepple--2014">Laepple and Huybers, 2014</a>), methodological challenges to assess the magnitude and spatial pattern of model biases in simulating internal variability, still remain <a class="section-link" data-title="Role of Internal Variability" href="#10.3.4.3">Section 10.3.4.3</a>).

On the other hand, extreme precipitation processes can occur on scales of tens of kilometres and smaller and thus require high resolution climate information when projecting future changes (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Xie--2015">Xie et al., 2015</a>).

In the case of observed data, issues to be considered include (but are not limited to): spatial and temporal resolution, accuracy, gaps in the recorded data, homogeneity in the station network, uncertainty treatment, etc. (Sections 10.2, 11.2, 11.9, 12.4; Atlas.1.4). In the case of modelled data, an assessment of the fitness-for-purpose typically includes an evaluation of numerical or statistical methods adopted, adequate representation of the physical processes, forcings and feedbacks relevant for the region and the change under consideration, the availability of adequate ensembles to assess the interplay between forced response and internal variability and the uncertainty in future projections (Sections 10.3, 10.4, 11.2, 11.9, 12.4 and Chapter Atlas). Attribution assessments are usually based on models and observations for which the fitness-for-purpose is assessed with similar criteria as those described above (Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution in Chapter 1). The assessment is made either directly or indirectly by scrutinizing the data and methods of the relevant literature against the criteria listed above.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-subhead-H1---no-space-below"><span class="•-Bold-condensed">2.

The examples are framed taking into account societal perspectives that provide context for their regional climate statements. Although the nature of an IPCC Working Group I assessment precludes engaging with users of climate information (<a class="section-link" data-title="Combining Approaches to Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="#10.5">Section 10.5</a>), we do cite relevant national and regional reports that give user perspectives to set a foundation from which one could distil climate information for users.

These factors contribute to attribution of historical climate change signals (<a class="section-link" data-title="Interplay Between Anthropogenic Change and Internal Variability at Regional Scales" href="#10.4">Section 10.4</a>), recognizing that attribution must account for the interplay between externally forced signals and unforced internal variability. This interplay is explored using multiple model ensembles, including, when appropriate and feasible, single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs). The multiple lines of evidence for the climate information may conflict, thus requiring distillation of the evidence (<a class="section-link" data-title="Combining Approaches to Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="#10.5">Section 10.5</a>) to arrive at climate-change statements. When moving from global climate information to climate information at the regional scale, following the structure above provides a basis for arriving at relevant and credible climate information. The comprehensive examples of distilling climate information thus show the value of working with multiple lines of evidence to develop robust climate change information for a region.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.6.1_p5">In addition to the three comprehensive examples, this section contains two additional examples analysing multiple sources of regional climate information.

Problems with water supply in many large cities in developing countries are endemic and rarely reported internationally. The water crisis in Cape Town attracted considerable international attention to a city with functional government structures, well-developed services (compared to other urban centres in Africa), a centre of international tourism, and an economic hub with GDP of 22 billion USD (about 7,500 USD per capita, <a class="reference-link" href="#Gallie--2018">Gallie et al., 2018</a>). Economic and social impacts of the crisis were significant. Loss of revenue for companies of all sizes resulted not only from the scaling down of water-dependent activities, but also from the need to invest in water-efficient technologies and processes. Tourism was affected through reduced arrivals and bookings, although only temporarily (<a class="reference-link" href="#CTT--2018">CTT, 2018</a>). In the agricultural sector, 30,000 people were laid-off and production dropped by 20% (<a class="reference-link" href="#Piennaar--2018">Piennaar and Boonzaaier, 2018</a>). The crisis initially polarized society, with conflict emerging between various water users and erosion of trust in the government, but eventually social cohesion and an acute awareness of limited water resources emerged (<a class="reference-link" href="#Robins--2019">Robins, 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.6.2.1_p2">Cape Town’s crisis resulted from a combination of a strong, rare multi-year meteorological drought (Figure 10.18), estimated at 1 in 300 years (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wolski--2018">Wolski, 2018</a>), and factors related to the nature of the water supply system, operational water management and water resource policies. Cape Town was very successful in implementing water-saving actions after the previous drought of 2000–2003, reducing water losses from over 22% to 15% (<a class="reference-link" href="#Frame--2007">Frame and Killick, 2007</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#DWA--2013">DWA, 2013</a>), breaking the previous coupling of growth in water demand with growth in population. As a consequence, Cape Town won a Water Smart City award from the C40 Cities program only three years prior to the crisis. However, the water-saving actions, together with changing priorities in water resource provision from infrastructure-oriented towards resource and demand management, may well have led to delays in implementation of the expansion of water supply infrastructure (<a class="reference-link" href="#Muller--2018">Muller, 2018</a>). The expansion plan, formulated a decade prior to the crisis, included an expectation of long-term climate-change drying in the region (<a class="reference-link" href="#DWAF--2007">DWAF, 2007</a>). The crisis also exposed structural deficiencies of water management and inadequacy of a policy process in which decisions about local water resources are taken at a national level, particularly in a situation of political tension (<a class="reference-link" href="#Visser--2018">Visser, 2018</a>). The crisis was widely seen as a harbinger of future problems to be faced by the city, and a highlight of vulnerability of many cities in the world resulting from the interplay of three factors: (i) the fast urban-population growth, (ii) the economic, policy, infrastructural and water resource paradigms and constraints, and (iii) anthropogenic climate change.</p><div class="Basic-Text-Frame" id="_idContainer052"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-26" id="figure-10-18" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_10_18.png"></span></strong><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Figure 10.1</span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">8 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Historical and projected rainfall and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) over the Cape Town region.

These drivers and, thus, the region’s rainfall are linked to the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO; <a class="reference-link" href="#Reason--2005">Reason and Rouault, 2005</a>) or Southern Annular Mode (SAM), the dominant monthly and interannual mode of Southern Hemisphere atmospheric variability, and a measure of the pressure gradient between mid- and high latitudes. (See Sections 3.3, 3.7, 4.3 and Annex IV.2.2 for more general discussion of the SAM.) While in the post-1930 period, the SAM displays a long-term positive trend, the Cape Town region’s rainfall does not, and only the post-1979 trends of rainfall and SAM are conceptually consistent.

However, the studies linking the Cape Town 2015–2017 drought to the hemispheric processes expressed by the SAM (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sousa--2018a">Sousa et al., 2018a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Burls--2019">Burls et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mahlalela--2019">Mahlalela et al., 2019</a>) focused almost exclusively on the post-1979 period, when global reanalyses are available.

The relationships between these phenomena and Cape Town rainfall have not been thoroughly investigated outside of the context of the 2015–2017 drought, but the drought itself was associated with poleward expansion of the subtropical anticyclones in the South Atlantic and South Indian oceans and (a resulting) poleward displacement of the moisture corridor across the South Atlantic (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sousa--2018a">Sousa et al., 2018a</a>), as well as a weaker subtropical jet (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mahlalela--2019">Mahlalela et al., 2019</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Burls--2019">Burls et al.

Additionally, there is a possible linkage between Cape Town rainfall and near-shore cold sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies arising from Ekman upwelling due to reduced westerly and increased south-easterly winds. These might lead to suppression of convection and reduction of rainfall over land (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rouault--2010">Rouault et al., 2010</a>). All these phenomena are conceptually consistent with the poleward migration of the westerlies and expansion of the tropics.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.6.2.4_p4">Rainfall in the Cape Town region also responds to SST anomalies in the south-east Atlantic, including the Agulhas Current retroflection region, which may drive intensification of low-pressure systems, leading to the trailing front strengthening as it makes landfall over the Cape Town region (<a class="reference-link" href="#Reason--2005">Reason and Jagadheesha, 2005</a>).

ENSO, however, does influence large-scale processes and phenomena relevant to the drought, though the relationship between ENSO and the SAM is complex, with each ENSO event influencing the SAM differently in different seasons (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ding--2012">Ding et al., 2012</a>).

Several challenges in the construction of regional climate change information have been identified:</p><ul><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---first">Limited climate monitoring in some regions impedes the full understanding of the relevant climate processes, an appropriate validation of model simulations, and the formulation of trustworthy regional climate information. Beyond temperature and precipitation, there is a shortage of observed variables needed for regional process understanding, attribution, and model development and validation, among others. Examples include surface evapotranspiration, soil moisture, radiation, wind and relative humidity, among many others identified by sectors sensitive to climate (Sections 10.2, 10.3 and 10.6).</li><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---continued">Compared to the increasing number of large-scale evaluations, there is a shortage of process-based model evaluations at regional scales to assess the fitness of the chosen models for specific purposes (Sections 10.3 and 10.4).</li><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---continued">There is a general lack of studies of the simulation of large-scale, downscaling-relevant processes in global models to support the design of global/regional model matrices that both span a sufficiently large range of projection uncertainty and realistically represent the regional climate of interest. The fitness of statistical methods for regional climate change studies has received limited attention by the scientific community, while as in the case of global models, process-based evaluation has proven useful (<a class="reference-link" href="#Soares--2019b">Soares et al., 2019b</a>). Studies of past changes and pseudo-reality studies to assess the predictors and model structures required for downscaling in a future climate are promising avenues (<a class="section-link" data-title="Using Models for Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="#10.3">Section 10.3</a>).</li><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---continued">Internal variability is a large contributor to climate uncertainty at regional scales, especially for extreme events. Further study of the processes governing regional internal variability, such as the modes of variability and the teleconnections that connect them to the regional variability, but also of the local processes and drivers involved, will help improve its understanding. The same applies to the validation of the simulated internal variability that underpins the trustworthiness of model-based climate information (Sections 10.3, 10.4 and 10.6, and Cross-Chapter Box 10.1).</li><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---continued">Methodologies on how to propagate climate uncertainties from global and regional scales down to the human settlement scale are still under development. In some cases, bias-adjustment methods are used with substantial neglect of the physical processes involved (<a class="section-link" data-title="Using Models for Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="#10.3">Section 10.3</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 10.2).</li><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---continued _idGenParaOverride-1">The production of regional climate information relies mainly on global and regional models that often do not incorporate human-controlled surface processes (urban parametrizations is one example) in their land surface components. This limits the representation of uncertainties for climate information at the urban scale (<a class="section-link" data-title="Using Models for Constructing Regional Climate Information" href="#10.3">Section 10.3</a>, Box 10.2, and Cross-Chapter Box 10.2).</li><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---continued">Literature plays a central role as a source for constructing regional climate change information. The amount of climate change literature available is unevenly distributed across the world, and large bodies of literature (e.g., local and regional reports) are often overlooked in the construction of climate information. Furthermore, research tends to focus on regions that attract the attention of the Global North so that climate aspects relevant to other regions may not receive sufficient attention for generating appropriate regional climate information (Sections 10.2, 10.3, 10.5 and 10.6).</li><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---continued">Governmental institutions producing regional and local climate information often use diverging approaches that are not necessarily coherent with each other. Coherency could be improved by implementing a quality control system and a traceability solution for the sources of the information. Collective work with the social sciences and humanities will improve the communication, perception and response to regional climate information and help translate user requirements (Sections 10.5 and 10.6).</li><li class="Body-copy_Bullet-and-numbered-lists_•-Bullet-list---last">There is a shortage of regional climate change studies distilling multiple lines of evidence. Most studies rely on either global models or downscaled global models, with an increasing number of studies focusing on the use of emulators and the selection and combination of models. However, there are limited studies distilling this information with a wider range of lines of evidence that includes observations, process understanding, attribution, and hierarchies of models (Sections 10.3, 10.5 and 10.6).</li></ul><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" id="10.7_p3">Addressing these challenges could facilitate the assessment of both sources and methodologies that lead to an increased fitness and usefulness of regional climate information for a wide range of purposes.</p></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="acknowledgements"><h1 class="unnumbered">Acknowledgements</h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-9-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">We acknowledge the E-OBS dataset and the data providers in the ECA&amp;D project (<a href="https://www.ecad.eu"><span class="•-Hyperlink--blue---underline-">https://www.ecad.eu</span></a>) for their help and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for delivering the GSMaP (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation) data to us.

Because climate change affects so many aspects of people’s daily work and living, climate change information can help with decision-making, but only when the information is relevant for the people involved in making those decisions. Users of climate information may be highly diverse, ranging from professionals in areas such as human health, agriculture or water management to a broader community that experiences the impacts of changing climate. Providing information that supports response actions thus requires engaging all relevant stakeholders, their knowledge and their experiences, formulating appropriate information, and developing a mutual understanding of the usefulness and limitations of the information.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">The development, delivery, and use of climate change information requires engaging all parties involved: those producing the climate data and related knowledge, those communicating it, and those who combine that information with their knowledge of the community, region or activity that climate change may impact. To be successful, these parties need to work together to explore the climate data and thus co-develop the climate information needed to make decisions or solve problems, distilling output from the various sources of climate knowledge into relevant climate information. Effective partnerships recognize and respond to the diversity of all parties involved (including their values, beliefs and interests), especially when they involve culturally diverse communities and their indigenous and local knowledge of weather, climate and their society. This is particularly true for climate change – a global issue posing challenges that vary by region. By recognizing this diversity, climate information can be relevant and credible, most notably when conveying the complexity of risks for human systems and ecosystems and for building resilience.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Constructing useful climate information requires considering all available sources in order to capture the fullest possible representation of projected changes and distilling the information in a way that meets the needs of the stakeholders and communities impacted by the changes. For example, climate scientists can provide information on future changes by using simulations of global and/or regional climate and inferring changes in the weather behaviour influencing a region. An effective distillation process (FAQ 10.1, Figure 1) engages with the intended recipients of the information, especially stakeholders whose work involves non-climatic factors, such as human health, agriculture or water resources. The distillation evaluates the accuracy of all information sources (observations, simulations, expert judgement), weighs the credibility of possible conflicting information, and arrives at climate information that includes estimating the confidence a user should have in it. Producers of climate data should further recognize that the geographic regions and time periods governing stakeholders’ interest (for example, the growing season of an agricultural zone) may not align well with the time and space resolution of available climate data; thus additional model development or data processing may be required to extract useful climate information.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">One way to distil complex information for stakeholder applications is to connect this information to experiences stakeholders have already had through storylines as plausible unfoldings of weather and climate events related to stakeholders’ experiences. Dialogue between stakeholders and climate scientists can determine the most relevant experiences to evaluate for possible future behaviour. The development of storylines uses the experience and expertise of stakeholders, such as water-resource managers and health professionals, who seek to develop appropriate response measures. Storylines are thus a pathway through the distillation process that can make climate information more accessible and physically comprehensible. For example, a storyline may take a common experience like an extended drought, with depleted water availability and damaged crops, and show how droughts may change in the future, perhaps with even greater precipitation deficits or longer duration. With appropriate choices, storylines can engage nuances of the climate information in a meaningful way by building on common experiences, thus enhancing the information’s usefulness.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body ParaOverride-4" lang="en-US">Forging partnerships among all involved with producing, exploring and distilling climate data into climate information is at the centre of creating stakeholder-relevant information. These partnerships can occur through direct interaction between climate scientists and stakeholders as well as through organizations that have emerged to facilitate this process, such as climate services, national and regional climate forums, and consulting firms providing specialized climate information. These so-called ‘boundary organizations’ can serve the varied needs of all who would fold climate information into their decision processes. All of these partnerships are vital</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">for arriving at climate information that responds to physical and cultural diversity and to challenges posed by climate change that can vary region-by-region around the world.</p><p class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-6" id="faq-10-1-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_10_1_Figure_1.png"></span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title ParaOverride-7" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 10.1, Figure 1</span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Climate information for decision makers is more useful if the physical and cultural diversity across the world is considered. </span> The figure illustrates schematically the broad range of knowledge that must be blended with the diversity of users to distil information that will have relevance and credibility.

This ‘urban heat island’ effect results from several factors, including reduced ventilation and heat trapping due to the close proximity of tall buildings, heat generated directly from human activities, the heat-absorbing properties of concrete and other urban building materials, and the limited amount of vegetation. Continuing urbanization and increasingly severe heatwaves under climate change will further amplify this effect in the future.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Today, cities are home to 55% of the world’s population. This number is increasing, and every year cities welcome 67 million new residents, 90% of whom are moving to cities in developing countries. By 2030, almost 60% of the world’s population is expected to live in urban areas. Cities and their inhabitants are highly vulnerable to weather and climate extremes, particularly heatwaves, because urban areas already are local hotspots. Cities are generally warmer – up to several degrees Celsius at night – than their surroundings. This warming effect, called the urban heat island, occurs because cities both receive and retain more heat than the surrounding countryside areas and because natural cooling processes are weakened in cities compared to rural areas.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Three main factors contribute to amplify the warming of urban areas (orange bars in FAQ 10.2, Figure 1). The strongest contribution comes from urban geometry, which depends on the number of buildings, their size and their proximity. Tall buildings close to each other absorb and store heat and also reduce natural ventilation. Human activities, which are very concentrated in cities, also directly warm the atmosphere locally, due to heat released from domestic and industrial heating or cooling systems, running engines, and other sources. Finally, urban warming also results directly from the heat-retaining properties of the materials that make up cities, including concrete buildings, asphalt roadways, and dark rooftops. These materials are very good at absorbing and retaining heat, and then re-emitting that heat at night.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">The urban heat island effect is further amplified in cities that lack vegetation and water bodies, both of which can strongly contribute to local cooling (green bars in FAQ 10.2, Figure 1). This means that when enough vegetation and water are included in the urban fabric, they can counterbalance the urban heat island effect, to the point of even cancelling out the urban heat island effect in some neighbourhoods.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">The urban heat island phenomenon is well-known and understood. For instance, temperature measurements from thermometers located in cities are corrected for this effect when global warming trends are calculated. Nevertheless, observations, including long-term measurements of the urban heat island effect are currently too limited to allow a full understanding of how the urban heat island varies across the world and across different types of cities and climatic zones, or how this effect will evolve in the future.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">As a result, it is hard to assess how climate change will affect the urban heat island effect, and various studies disagree. Two things are, however, very clear. First, future urbanization will expand the urban heat island areas, thereby amplifying future warming in many places all over the world. In some places, the nighttime warming from the urban heat island effect could even be on the same order of magnitude as the warming expected from human-induced climate change. Second, more intense, longer and more frequent heatwaves caused by climate change will more strongly impact cities and their inhabitants, because the extra warming from the urban heat island effect will exacerbate the impacts of climate change.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">In summary, cities are currently local hotspots because their structure, material and activities trap and release heat and reduce natural cooling processes. In the future, climate change will, on average, have a limited effect on the magnitude of the urban heat island itself, but ongoing urbanization together with more frequent, longer and warmer heatwaves will make cities more exposed to global warming.</p><p class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" lang="en-US"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-7" id="faq-10-2-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_10_2_Figure_1.png"></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title ParaOverride-7" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 10.2, Fig</span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">ure 1 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Efficiency of the various factors at warming up or cooling down neighbourhoods of urban areas. </span>Overall, cities tend to be warmer than their surroundings.
