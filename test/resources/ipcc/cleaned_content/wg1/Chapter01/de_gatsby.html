Sustained changes have been documented in all major elements of the climate system, including the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, biosphere and ocean. Multiple lines of evidence indicate the unprecedented nature of recent large-scale climatic changes in the context of all human history, and that these changes represent a millennial-scale commitment for the slow-responding elements of the climate system, resulting in continued worldwide loss of ice, increase in ocean heat content, sea level rise and deep ocean acidification. <!-- -->{1.2.1, 1.3, Box 1.2, Appendix 1.A}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the international policy context of IPCC reports has changed. </span> The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--1992">UNFCCC, 1992</a>) has the overarching objective of preventing ‘dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system’. Responding to that objective, the Paris Agreement (2015) established the long-term goals of ‘holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’ and of achieving ‘a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century’. Parties to the Agreement have submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) indicating their planned mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, the NDCs submitted as of 2020 are insufficient to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to be consistent with trajectories limiting global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confiden</i><i class="•-Condensed-italic">ce</i>). <!-- -->{1.1, 1.2}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">This report provides information of potential relevance to the 2023 global stocktake. </span> The five-yearly stocktakes called for in the Paris Agreement will evaluate alignment among the Agreement’s long-term goals, its means of implementation and support, and evolving global efforts in climate change mitigation (efforts to limit climate change) and adaptation (efforts to adapt to changes that cannot be avoided). In this context, WGI assesses, among other topics, remaining cumulative carbon emissions budgets for a range of global warming levels, effects of long-lived and short-lived climate forcers, observed climate changes and their attribution to human forcing, and projected changes in sea level and climate extremes. <!-- -->{Cross-Chapter Box 1.1}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Understanding of the fundamental features of the climate system is robust and well established. </span> Scientists in the 19th century identified the major natural factors influencing the climate system. They also hypothesized the potential for anthropogenic climate change due to carbon dioxide (CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub>) emitted by fossil fuel combustion. The principal natural drivers of climate change, including changes in incoming solar radiation, volcanic activity, orbital cycles, and changes in global biogeochemical cycles, have been studied systematically since the early 20th century. Other major anthropogenic drivers, such as atmospheric aerosols (fine solid particles or liquid droplets), land-use change and non-CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> greenhouse gases, were identified by the 1970s.

The early chapters of this report broadly organize their assessments according to overarching realms: the atmosphere, the biosphere, the cryosphere (surface areas covered by frozen water, such as glaciers and ice sheets), and the ocean. Elsewhere in the report, and in previous IPCC assessments, the land is also used as an integrating realm that includes parts of the biosphere and the cryosphere. These overarching realms have been studied and measured in increasing detail by scientists, institutions and the general public since the 18th century, throughout the era of instrumental observation (<a class="section-link" data-title="How We Got Here: The Scientific Context" href="#1.3">Section 1.3</a>). Today, observations include those taken by numerous land surface stations, ocean surface measurements from ships and buoys, underwater instrumentation, satellite and surface-based remote sensing, and in situ atmospheric measurements from aeroplanes and balloons. These instrumental observations are combined with paleoclimate reconstructions and historical documentations to produce a highly detailed picture of the past and present state of the whole climate system, and to allow assessments about rates of change across the different realms (<a class="section-link" data-title="Changing State of the Climate System" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2">Chapter 2</a> and <a class="section-link" data-title="Major Developments and Their Implications" href="#1.5">Section 1.5</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Figure 1.4 documents that the climate system is undergoing a comprehensive set of changes.

The paleorecords show that sustained changes in global mean temperature of a few degrees Celsius are associated with increases in sea level of several tens of metres (Figure 1.5). During two extended warm periods (interglacials) of the last 800 kyr, sea level is estimated to have been at least six metres higher than today (Chapter 2; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dutton--2015">Dutton et al., 2015</a>). During the last interglacial, sustained warmer temperatures in Greenland preceded the peak of sea level rise (Figure 5.15 in <a class="reference-link" href="#Masson-Delmotte--2013">Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013</a>).

The first SED aimed to ‘ensure the scientific integrity of the first periodic review’ of the UNFCCC, the 2013–2015 review.

The second SED provides a formal venue for the scientific and the policy communities to discuss the requirements and benchmarks to achieve the ‘long-term temperature goal’ (LTTG) of 1.5°C and well below 2°C global warming. The discussions also concern the associated timing of net zero emissions targets and the different interpretations of the PA LTTG, including the possibility of overshooting the 1.5° C warming level before returning to it by means of negative emissions (e.g., <a class="section-link" data-title="Dimensions of Integration: Scenarios, Global Warming Levels and Cumulative Carbon Emissions" href="#1.6">Section 1.6</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schleussner--2020">Schleussner and Fyson, 2020</a>).

Since AR5, there is increasing attention on the need for coordination among previously independent international agendas, and a recognition that climate change, disaster risk, economic development, biodiversity conservation and human well-being are tightly interconnected. The current COVID-19 pandemic provides an example of the need for such interconnection, with its widespread impacts on economy, society and environment (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Shan--2021">Shan et al., 2021</a>). Cross-Chapter Box 6.1 assesses the consequences of the COVID-19 lockdowns for emissions of GHGs and SLCFs, and related implications for the climate. Another example of the interconnected nature of these issues is the close link between SLCF emissions, climate change and air quality concerns (Chapter 6). Emissions of halocarbons have previously been successfully regulated under the Montreal Protocol and its Kigali Amendment.

Achieving shared understanding is complicated, since scientific knowledge interacts with pre-existing conceptions of weather and climate that have built up in diverse world cultures over centuries, and which are often embedded in strongly held values and beliefs stemming from ethnic or national identities, traditions, religions, and lived relationships to weather, land and sea (Van Asselt and Rotmans, 1996; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rayner--1998">Rayner and Malone, 1998</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hulme--2009">Hulme, 2009</a>, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Green--2010">Green et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jasanoff--2010">Jasanoff, 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Orlove--2010">Orlove et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nakashima--2012">Nakashima et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2020">Shepherd and Sobel, 2020</a>).These diverse, more local understandings can both contrast with and enrich the planetary-scale analyses of global climate science (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">hi</i><i class="•-Condensed-italic">gh confidence</i>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Political cultures also give rise to variation in how climate science knowledge is interpreted, used and challenged (<a class="reference-link" href="#Leiserowitz--2006">Leiserowitz, 2006</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Oreskes--2010">Oreskes and Conway, 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Brulle--2012">Brulle et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dunlap--2013">Dunlap and Jacques, 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mahony--2014">Mahony, 2014</a>, 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Brulle--2019">Brulle, 2019</a>).

Box 1.1 summarizes this framework as it is used in AR6.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-heading"><span class="•-Bold-condensed">Box 1.1 | Treatment of Uncertainty and Calibrated Uncertainty </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed">Language in AR6</span><span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">The AR6 follows the approach developed for AR5 (Box 1.1, Figure 1), as described in the ‘Guidance Notes for Lead Authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on Consistent Treatment of Uncertainties’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mastrandrea--2010">Mastrandrea et al., 2010</a>). The uncertainty Guidance Note used in AR6 clarifies the relationship between the qualitative description of confidence and the quantitative representation of uncertainty expressed by the likelihood scale. The calibrated uncertainty language emphasizes traceability of the assessment throughout the process. Key chapter findings presented in each chapter’s Executive Summary are supported in the chapter text by a summary of the underlying literature that is assessed in terms of evidence and agreement, confidence, and also likelihood, if applicable.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">In all three Working Groups, author teams evaluate underlying scientific understanding and use two metrics to communicate the degree of certainty in key findings. These metrics are:</p><ol><li class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-Number-–first"><i class="•-Condensed-italic"> confidence: </i>a qualitative measure of the validity of a finding, based on the type, amount, quality and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement.</li><li class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-Number-–-last"><i class="•-Condensed-italic">Likelihood: </i>a quantitative measure of uncertainty in a finding, expressed probabilistically (e.g., based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgement by the author team or from a formal quantitative survey of expert views, or both).</li></ol><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">Throughout IPCC reports, the calibrated language indicating a formal confidence assessment is clearly identified by<i class="•-Condensed-italic">italics</i> (e.g., <i class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</i>). Where appropriate, findings can also be formulated as statements of fact without uncertainty qualifiers.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">Box.1.1, Figure 1 (adapted from <a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2017">Mach et al., 2017</a>) shows the idealized step-by-step process by which IPCC authors assess scientific understanding and uncertainties. It starts with the evaluation of the available evidence and agreement (steps 1–2). The following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: <i class="•-Condensed-italic">limited, medium, </i>or<i class="•-Condensed-italic">robust</i>; and the degree of agreement: <i class="•-Condensed-italic">low, medium, </i>or<i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high</i>. Generally, evidence is most robust when there are multiple, consistent, independent lines of high-quality evidence.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">If the author team concludes that there is sufficient evidence and agreement, the level of confidence can be evaluated. In this step, assessments of evidence and agreement are combined into a single metric (steps 3–5). The assessed level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: <i class="•-Condensed-italic">very low, low, medium, high, </i> and <i class="•-Condensed-italic">very high</i>. Step 4 depicts how summary statements for evidence and agreement relate to confidence levels. For a given evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned depending on the context, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement correlate with increasing confidence. When confidence in a finding is assessed to be <i class="•-Condensed-italic">low</i>, this does not necessarily mean that confidence in its opposite is <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high, </i> and vice versa. Similarly, <i class="•-Condensed-italic">low</i><i class="•-Condensed-italic"> confidence</i> does not imply distrust in the finding; instead, it means that the statement is the best conclusion based on currently available knowledge. Further research and methodological progress may change the level of confidence in any finding in future assessments.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">Ifthe expert judgement of the author team concludes that there is sufficient confidence and quantitative/probabilistic evidence, assessment conclusions can be expressed with likelihood statements (steps 5–6). Unless otherwise indicated, likelihood statements are related to findings for which the authors’ assessment of confidence is <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high</i>or<i class="•-Condensed-italic">very high</i>. Terms used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome include: <i class="•-Condensed-italic">virtually certain</i>: 99–100% probability, <i class="•-Condensed-italic">very likely </i>: 90–100%, <i class="•-Condensed-italic">likely </i>: 66–100%, <i class="•-Condensed-italic">about as likely as not </i>: 33–66%, <i class="•-Condensed-italic">unlikely </i>: 0–33%, <i class="•-Condensed-italic">very unlikely </i>: 0–10%, <i class="•-Condensed-italic">exceptionally unlikely </i>: 0–1%. Additional terms (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">extremely likely </i>: 95–100%, <i class="•-Condensed-italic">more likely than not </i>&gt;50–100%, and <i class="•-Condensed-italic">extremely unlikely </i>0–5%) may also be used when appropriate.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body ParaOverride-1">Likelihood can indicate probabilities for single events or broader outcomes. The probabilistic information may build from statistical or modelling analyses, other quantitative analyses, or expert elicitation. The framework encourages authors, where appropriate, to present probability more precisely than can be done with the likelihood scale, for example with complete probability distributions or percentile ranges, including quantification of tails of distributions, which are important for risk management (Sections <a class="section-link" data-title="The Policy and Governance Context" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.2.2">1.2.2</a> and <a class="section-link" data-title="Considering an Uncertain Future" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.4.4">1.4.4</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2017">Mach et al., 2017</a>).

The 90% uncertainty interval, reported in square brackets [x to y], is estimated to have a 90% likelihood of covering the value that is being estimated. The range encompasses the median value and there is an estimated 10% combined likelihood of the value being below the lower end of the range (x) and above its upper end (y). Often the distribution will be considered symmetric about the corresponding best estimate (as in the illustrative example in the figure), but this is not always the case. In this report, an assessed 90% uncertainty interval is referred to as a ‘<i class="•-Condensed-italic">very likely </i>range’. Similarly, an assessed 66% uncertainty interval is referred to as a ‘<i class="•-Condensed-italic">likely </i>range’.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Considerable critical attention has focused on whether applying the IPCC framework effectively achieves consistent treatment of uncertainties and clear communication of findings to users (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shapiro--2010">Shapiro et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Adler--2014">Adler and Hirsch Hadorn, 2014</a>). Specific concerns include, for example, the transparency and traceability of expert judgements underlying the assessment conclusions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2016">Oppenheimer et al., 2016</a>) and the context-dependent representations and interpretations of probability terms (<a class="reference-link" href="#Budescu--2009">Budescu et al., 2009</a>, 2012; <a class="reference-link" href="#Janzwood--2020">Janzwood, 2020</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Budescu--2014">Budescu et al. (2014)</a> surveyed 25 samples in 24 countries (a total of 10,792 individual responses), finding that even when shown IPCC uncertainty guidance, lay readers systematically misunderstood IPCC likelihood statements. When presented with a ‘high likelihood’ statement, they understood it as indicating a lower likelihood than intended by the IPCC authors. Conversely, they interpreted ‘low likelihood’ statements as indicating a higher likelihood than intended. In another study, British lay readers interpreted uncertainty language somewhat differently from IPCC guidance, but Chinese lay people reading the same uncertainty language translated into Chinese differed much more in their interpretations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Harris--2013">Harris et al., 2013</a>). Further, even though it is objectively more probable that wide uncertainty intervals will encompass true values, wide intervals were interpreted by lay people as implying subjective uncertainty or lack of knowledge on the part of scientists (<a class="reference-link" href="#L%C3%B8hre--2019">Løhre et al., 2019</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2017">Mach et al. (2017)</a> investigated the advances and challenges in approaches to expert judgment in AR5. Their analysis showed that the shared framework increased the overall comparability of assessment conclusions across all Working Groups and topics related to climate change, from the physical science basis to resulting impacts, risks, and options for response. Nevertheless, many challenges in developing and communicating assessment conclusions persist, especially for findings drawn from multiple disciplines and Working Groups, for subjective aspects of judgements, and for findings with substantial uncertainties (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adler--2014">Adler and Hirsch Hadorn, 2014</a>). In summary, the calibrated language cannot entirely prevent misunderstandings, including a tendency to systematically underestimate the probability of the IPCC’s higher-likelihood conclusions and overestimate the probability of the lower-likelihood ones (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>). However, a consistent and systematic approach across Working Groups to communicate the assessment outcomes is an important characteristic of the IPCC.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Some suggested alternatives are impractical, such as always including numerical values along with calibrated language (<a class="reference-link" href="#Budescu--2014">Budescu et al., 2014</a>). Others, such as using positive instead of negative expressions of low-to-medium probabilities, show promise but were not proposed in time for adoption in AR6 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Juanchich--2020">Juanchich et al., 2020</a>). This report therefore retains the same calibrated language used in AR5 (Box 1.1). Like previous reports, AR6 also includes FAQs that express its chief conclusions in plain language designed for lay readers.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The framework for communicating uncertainties does not allow for indicating cases where ‘deep uncertainty’ is identified in the assessment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adler--2014">Adler and Hirsch Hadorn, 2014</a>). The definition of deep uncertainty in IPCC assessments has been described in the context of SROCC (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>; Box 5 in <a class="reference-link" href="#Abram--2019">Abram et al., 2019</a>): a situation of deep uncertainty exists when experts or stakeholders do not know or cannot agree on: (i) appropriate conceptual models that describe relationships among key driving forces in a system; (ii) the probability distributions used to represent uncertainty about key variables and parameters; and/or (iii) how to weigh and value desirable alternative outcomes (Cross-Chapter Box 1.2 and Annex VII: Glossary; <a class="reference-link" href="#Abram--2019">Abram et al., 2019</a>). Since AR5, ‘storylines’ or ‘narratives’ approaches have been used to address issues related to deep uncertainty, for example low-likelihood events that would have high impact if they occurred, to better inform risk assessment and decision making (<a class="section-link" data-title="Considering an Uncertain Future" href="#1.4.4">Section 1.4.4</a>). <a class="section-link" data-title="Ocean, Cryosphere and Sea Level Change" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-9">Chapter 9</a> (Section 9.2.3) notes deep uncertainty in long-term projections for sea level rise, and in processes related to marine ice-sheet instability and marine ice cliff instability.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="1.2.3.2"><h3 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">1.2.3.2 Values, Science and Climate Change Communication<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-10-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">As noted above, values – fundamental attitudes about what is important, good, and right – play critical roles in all human endeavours, including climate science. In AR5, Chapters 3 and 4 of the WGIII Assessment addressed the role of cultural, social and ethical values in climate change mitigation and sustainable development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fleurbaey--2014">Fleurbaey et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kolstad--2014">Kolstad et al., 2014</a>). These values include widely accepted concepts of human rights, enshrined in international law, that are relevant to climate impacts and policy objectives (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hall--2012">Hall and Weiss, 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Peel--2018">Peel and Osofsky, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Setzer--2019">Setzer and Vanhala, 2019</a>). Specific values – human life, subsistence, stability, and equitable distribution of the costs and benefits of climate impacts and policies – are explicit in the texts of the UNFCCC and the PA (<a class="reference-link" href="#Breakey--2016">Breakey et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dooley--2016">Dooley and Parihar, 2016</a>). Here we address the role of values in how scientific knowledge is created, verified and communicated. Chapters 10, 12 and Cross-Chapter Box 12.2 address how the specific values and contexts of users can be addressed in the co-production of climate information.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The epistemic (knowledge-related) values of science include explanatory power, predictive accuracy, falsifiability, replicability, and justification of claims by explicit reasoning (<a class="reference-link" href="#Popper--1959">Popper, 1959</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kuhn--1977">Kuhn, 1977</a>). These are supported by key institutional values, including openness, ‘organized scepticism’, and objectivity or ‘disinterestedness’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Merton--1973">Merton, 1973</a>), operationalized as well-defined methods, documented evidence, publication, peer review, and systems for institutional review of research ethics (COSEPUP, 2009; <a class="reference-link" href="#Elliott--2017">Elliott, 2017</a>). In recent decades, open data, open code and scientific cyber-infrastructure (notably the Earth System Grid Federation, a partnership of climate modelling centers dedicated to supporting climate research by providing secure, web-based, distributed access to climate model data) have facilitated scrutiny from a larger range of participants, and FAIR data stewardship principles – making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) – are being mainstreamed in many fields (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wilkinson--2016">Wilkinson et al., 2016</a>). Climate science norms and practices embodying these scientific values and principles include the publication of data and model code, multiple groups independently analysing the same problems and data, model intercomparison projects (MIPs), explicit evaluations of uncertainty, and comprehensive assessments by national academies of science and the IPCC.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The formal Principles Governing IPCC Work (1998, amended 2003, 2006, 2012, 2013) specify that assessments should be ‘comprehensive, objective, open and transparent.’ The IPCC assessment process seeks to achieve these goals in several ways: by evaluating evidence and agreement across all relevant peer-reviewed literature, especially that published or accepted since the previous assessment; by maintaining a traceable, transparent process that documents the reasoning, data and tools used in the assessment; and by maximizing the diversity of participants, authors, experts, reviewers, institutions and communities represented, across scientific discipline, geographical location, gender, ethnicity, nationality and other characteristics. The multi-stage review process is critical to ensure an objective, comprehensive and robust assessment, with hundreds of scientists, other experts and governments providing comments to a series of drafts before the report is finalized.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Social values are implicit in many choices made during the construction, assessment and communication of climate science information (<a class="reference-link" href="#Heymann--2017">Heymann et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Skelton--2017">Skelton et al., 2017</a>). Some climate science questions are prioritized for investigation, or given a specific framing or context, because of their relevance to climate policy and governance. One example is the question of how the effects of a 1.5°C global warming would differ from those of a 2°C warming, an assessment specifically requested by Parties to the PA. The SR1.5 (2018) explicitly addressed this issue ‘within the context of sustainable development; considerations of ethics, equity and human rights; and the problem of poverty’ (Chapters 1 and 5; see also <a class="reference-link" href="#Hoegh-Guldberg--2019">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019</a>) following the outcome of the approval of the outline of the Special Report by the IPCC during its 44th Session (Bangkok, Thailand, 17–20 October 2016). Likewise, particular metrics are sometimes prioritized in climate model improvement efforts because of their practical relevance for specific economic sectors or stakeholders. Examples include reliable simulation of precipitation in a specific region, or attribution of particular extreme weather events to inform rebuilding and future policy (Chapters 8 and 11; <a class="reference-link" href="#Intemann--2015">Intemann, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Otto--2018">Otto et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#James--2019">James et al., 2019</a>). Sectors or groups whose interests do not influence research and modelling priorities may thus receive less information in support of their climate-related decisions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parker--2018">Parker and </a><a class="reference-link" href="#Winsberg--2018">Winsberg, 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Recent work also recognizes that choices made throughout the research process can affect the relative likelihood of false alarms (overestimating the probability and/or magnitude of hazards) or missed warnings (underestimating the probability and/or magnitude of hazards), known respectively as Type I and Type II errors. Researchers may choose different methods depending on which type of error they view as most important to avoid, a choice that may reflect social values (<a class="reference-link" href="#Douglas--2009">Douglas, 2009</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Knutti--2018">Knutti, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lloyd--2018">Lloyd and Oreskes, 2018</a>). This reflects a fundamental trade-off between the values of reliability and informativeness. When uncertainty is large, researchers may choose to report a wide range as <i class="•-Condensed-italic">very likely </i>, even though it is less informative about potential consequences. By contrast, high-likelihood statements about a narrower range may be more informative, yet also prove less reliable if new evidence later emerges that widens the range. Furthermore, the difference between narrower and wider uncertainty intervals has been shown to be confusing to lay readers, who often interpret wider intervals as less certain (<a class="reference-link" href="#L%C3%B8hre--2019">Løhre et al., 2019</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="1.2.3.3"><h3 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">1.2.3.3 Climate Information, Co-production and Climate Services<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-11-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">In AR6, ‘climate information’ refers to specific information about the past, current or future state of the climate system that is relevant for mitigation, adaptation and risk management.

Here the phrase ‘regional climate information’ refers to predefined reference sets of land and ocean regions; various typological domains (such as mountains or monsoons); temporal frames including baseline periods as well as near term (2021–2040), medium term (2041–2060) and long term (2081–2100); and global warming levels (Chapters 10 and 12, Sections <a class="section-link" data-title="Baselines, Reference Periods and Anomalies" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.4.1">1.4.1</a> and <a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Regions Used in AR6" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.4.5">1.4.5</a>, and Atlas). Regional climate change information is constructed from multiple lines of evidence including observations, paleoclimate proxies, reanalyses, attribution of changes and climate model projections from both global and regional climate models (Sections 1.5.3 and 10.2–10.4). The constructed regional information needs to take account of user context and values for risk assessment, adaptation and policy decisions (Sections 1.2.3 and 10.5).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">As detailed in Chapter 10, scientific climate information often requires ‘tailoring’ to meet the requirements of specific decision-making contexts. In a study of the UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP09) project, researchers concluded that climate scientists struggled to grasp and respond to users’ information needs because they lacked experience interacting with users, institutions and scientific idioms outside the climate science domain (<a class="reference-link" href="#Porter--2017">Porter and Dessai, 2017</a>). Economic theory predicts the value of ‘polycentric’ approaches to climate change informed by specific global, regional and local knowledge and experience (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ostrom--1996">Ostrom, 1996</a>, 2012). This is confirmed by numerous case studies of extended, iterative dialogue among scientists, policymakers, resource managers and other stakeholders to produce mutually understandable, usable, task-related information and knowledge, policymaking and resource management around the world (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lemos--2005">Lemos and Morehouse, 2005</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lemos--2012">Lemos et al., 2012</a>, 2014, 2018; see <a class="reference-link" href="#Vaughan--2014">Vaughan and Dessai, 2014</a> for a critical view). The SR1.5 (2018) assessed that ‘education, information, and community approaches, including those that are informed by indigenous knowledge and local knowledge, can accelerate the wide-scale behaviour changes consistent with adapting to and limiting global warming to 1.5°C. These approaches are more effective when combined with other policies and tailored to the motivations, capabilities and resources of specific actors and contexts (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>).’ These extended dialogic co-production and education processes have thus been demonstrated to improve the quality of both scientific information and governance (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>) (Section 10.5 and Cross Chapter Box 12.2).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Since AR5, climate services have increased at multiple levels (local, national, regional and global) to aid decision-making of individuals and organizations and to enable preparedness and early climate change action.

Other studies show that people react differently to climate change news when it is framed as a catastrophe (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hine--2016">Hine et al., 2016</a>), as associated with local identities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sapiains--2016">Sapiains et al., 2016</a>), or as a social justice issue (<a class="reference-link" href="#Howell--2013">Howell, 2013</a>). Similarly, audience segmentation studies show that responses to climate change vary between groups of people with different, although not necessarily opposing, views on this phenomenon (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Maibach--2011">Maibach et al., 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sherley--2014">Sherley et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Detenber--2016">Detenber et al., 2016</a>). In Brazil, two studies have shown the influence of mass media on the high level of public climate change concern in that country (Rodasand Di Giulio, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dayrell--2019">Dayrell, 2019</a>). <i class="•-Condensed-italic"></i>In the USA, analyses of television network news show that climate change receives minimal attention, is most often framed in a political context, and largely fails to link extreme weather events to climate change using appropriate probability framing (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hassol--2016">Hassol et al., 2016</a>). However, recent evidence suggests that Climate Matters (an Internet resource to help US television weather forecasters link weather to climate change trends) may have had a positive effect on public understanding of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Myers--2020">Myers et al., 2020</a>). Also, some media outlets have recently adopted and promoted terms and phrases stronger than the more neutral ‘climate change’ and ‘global warming’, including ‘climate crisis’, ‘global heating’, and ‘climate emergency’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zeldin-O%E2%80%99Neill--2019">Zeldin-O’Neill, 2019</a>). Google searches on those terms, and on ‘climate action’, increased 20-fold in 2019, when large social movements such as School Strikes forClimate gained worldwide attention (<a class="reference-link" href="#Thackeray--2020">Thackeray et al., 2020</a>). We thus assess that specific characteristics of media coverage play a major role in climate understanding and perception (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>), including how IPCC assessments are received by the general public.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1">Since AR5, social media platforms have dramatically altered the mass-media landscape, bringing about a shift from uni-directional transfer of information and ideas to more fluid, multi-directional flows (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pearce--2019">Pearce et al., 2019</a>). A survey covering 18 Latin American countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#StatKnows-CR2--2019">StatKnows-CR2, 2019</a>) found that the main sources of information about climate change mentioned were the Internet (52% of mentions), followed by social media (18%). There are well-known challenges with social media, such as misleading or false presentations of scientific findings, incivility that diminishes the quality of discussion around climate change topics, and ‘filter bubbles’ that restrict interactions to those with broadly similar views (<a class="reference-link" href="#Anderson--2017">Anderson and Huntington, 2017</a>). However, at certain moments (such as at the release of the AR5 WGI report), Twitter studies have found that more mixed, highly-connected groups existed, within which members were less polarized (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pearce--2014">Pearce et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Williams--2015">Williams et al., 2015</a>). Thus, social media platforms may in some circumstances support dialogic or co-production approaches to climate communication. Because the contents of IPCC reports speak not only to policymakers, but also to the broader public, the character and effects of media coverage are important considerations across Working Groups.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="1.3"><h1 class="numbered">1.3 How We Got Here: The Scientific Context</h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-4-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1">Scientific understanding of the climate system’s fundamental features is robust and well established.

National and colonial weather services built networks of surface stations in the 19th century. By the mid-19th century, semi-standardized naval weather logs recorded winds, currents, precipitation, air pressure, and temperature at sea, initiating the longest continuous quasi-global instrumental record (<a class="reference-link" href="#Maury--1849">Maury, 1849</a>, 1855, 1860). Because the ocean covers over 70% of global surface area and constantly exchanges energy with the atmosphere, both air and sea surface temperatures (SST) recorded in these naval logs are crucial variables in climate studies. <a class="reference-link" href="#Dove--1853">Dove (1853)</a> mapped seasonal isotherms over most of the globe. By 1900, a patchy weather data-sharing system reached all continents except Antarctica. Regular compilation of climatological data for the world began in 1905 with the Réseau Mondial (Air Ministry – Meteorological Office, 1921), and similar compilations – the World Weather Records (<a class="reference-link" href="#Clayton--1927">Clayton, 1927</a>) and Monthly Climatic Data for the World (est. 1948) – have been published continuously since their founding.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Landand ocean surface temperature data have been repeatedly evaluated, refined and extended (<a class="section-link" data-title="Observational Data and Observing Systems" href="#1.5.1">Section 1.5.1</a>). As computer power increased and older data were recovered from handwritten records, the number of surface station records used in published global land temperature time series grew. A pioneering study for 1880–1935 used fewer than 150 stations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Callendar--1938">Callendar, 1938</a>). A benchmark study of 1880–2005 incorporated 4300 stations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brohan--2006">Brohan et al., 2006</a>). A study of the 1753–2011 period included previously unused station data, for a total of 36,000 stations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rohde--2013">Rohde et al., 2013</a>); recent versions of this dataset comprise over 40,000 land stations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rohde--2020">Rohde and Hausfather, 2020</a>). Several centres, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Hadley, and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), produce SST datasets independently calculated from instrumental records. In the 2000s, adjustments for bias due to different measurement methods (buckets, engine intake thermometers, moored and drifting buoys) resulted in major improvements of SST data (<a class="reference-link" href="#Thompson--2008">Thompson et al., 2008</a>), and these improvements continue (<a class="reference-link" href="#Huang--2017">Huang et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kennedy--2019">Kennedy et al., 2019</a>). SST and land-based data are incorporated into global surface temperature datasets calculated independently by multiple research groups, including NOAA, NASA, Berkeley Earth, Hadley-CRU, JMA, and China Meteorological Administration (CMA). Each group aggregates the raw measurement data, applies various adjustments for non-climatic biases such as urban heat-island effects, and addresses unevenness in geospatial and temporal sampling with various techniques (see (<a class="section-link" data-title="Temperatures during the instrumental period – surface" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.1.1.3">Section 2.3.1.1.3</a> and Table 2.4 for references). Other research groups provide alternative interpolations of these datasets using different methods (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Cowtan--2014">Cowtan and Way, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kadow--2020">Kadow et al., 2020</a>). Using the then available global surface temperature datasets, AR5 WGI assessed that the GMST increased by 0.85°C from 1880 to 2012 and found that each of the three decades following 1980 was successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850 (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2013b">IPCC, 2013b</a>). Marine air temperatures, especially those measured during nighttime, are increasingly also used to examine variability and long-term trends (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Rayner--2006">Rayner et al., 2006</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kent--2013">Kent et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cornes--2020">Cornes et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Junod--2020">Junod and Christy, 2020</a>).

These provide the longest continuous quasi-global record of the atmosphere’s vertical dimension (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stickler--2010">Stickler et al., 2010</a>). New methods for spatial and temporal homogenisation (intercalibration and quality control) of radiosonde records were introduced in the 2000s (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sherwood--2008">Sherwood et al., 2008</a>, 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Haimberger--2012">Haimberger et al., 2012</a>). Since 1978, Microwave Sounding Units (MSU) mounted on Earth-orbiting satellites have provided a second high-altitude data source, measuring temperature, humidity, ozone, and liquid water throughout the atmosphere. Over time, these satellite data have required numerous adjustments to account for such factors as orbital precession and decay (<a class="reference-link" href="#Edwards--2010">Edwards, 2010</a>). Despite repeated adjustments, however, marked differences remain in the temperature trends from surface, radiosonde, and satellite observations; between the results from three research groups that analyse satellite data (University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), and NOAA); and between modelled and satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends (<a class="reference-link" href="#Thorne--2011">Thorne et al., 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Santer--2017">Santer et al., 2017</a>).

In the 2000s, Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and radio occultation (GNSS-RO) measurements provided new ways to measure temperature at altitude, complementing data from the MSU. GNSS-RO is a new independent, absolutely calibrated source, using the refraction of radio-frequency signals from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to measure temperature, pressure and water vapour (<a class="section-link" data-title="Dataset developments" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.1.2.1">Section 2.3.1.2.1</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Foelsche--2008">Foelsche et al., 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Anthes--2011">Anthes, 2011</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Heat-retaining properties of the atmosphere’s constituent gases were closely investigated in the 19th century. <a class="reference-link" href="#Foote--1856">Foote (1856)</a> measured solar heating of CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> experimentally and argued that higher concentrations in the atmosphere would increase Earth’s temperature.

For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Stouffer--2017">Stouffer and Manabe (2017)</a> compared projections made in the early 1990s with subsequent observations. They found that the projected surface pattern of warming, and the vertical structure of temperature change in both the atmosphere and ocean, were realistic. Rahmstorf et al. (2007, 2012) examined projections of global surface temperature and GMSL assessed by TAR and AR4 and found that the global surface temperature projections were in good agreement with the subsequent observations, but that sea level projections were underestimates compared to subsequent observations.

Baseline refers to a period against which differences are calculated, whereas reference period is used more generally to indicate a time period of interest, or a period over which some relevant statistics are calculated (Glossary). Variations in observed and simulated climate variables over time are often presented as ‘anomalies’, that is, the differences relative to a baseline, rather than using the absolute values. This is done for several reasons.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">First, anomalies are often used when combining data from multiple locations, because the absolute values can vary over small spatial scales which are not densely observed or simulated, whereas anomalies are representative for much larger scales (e.g., for temperature; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hansen--1987">Hansen and Lebedeff, 1987</a>). Since their baseline value is zero by definition, anomalies are also less susceptible to biases arising from changes in the observational network. Second, the seasonality in different climate indicators can be removed using anomalies to more clearly distinguish variability from long-term trends.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1">Third, different datasets can have different absolute values for the same climate variable that should be removed to allow effective comparisons of variations over time. This is often required when comparing climate simulations with each other, or when comparing simulations with observations, as simulated climate variables are also affected by model bias that can be removed when they are presented as anomalies. It can also be required when comparing observational datasets or reanalyses (<a class="section-link" data-title="New Developments in Reanalyses" href="#1.5.2">Section 1.5.2</a>) with each other, due to systematic differences in the underlying measurement system (Figure 1.11). Understanding the reasons for any absolute difference is important, but whether the simulated absolute value matters when projecting future change will depend on the variable of interest. For example, there is not a strong relationship between climate sensitivity of a model (which is an indicator of the degree of future warming) and the simulated absolute global surface temperature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mauritsen--2012">Mauritsen et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hawkins--2016">Hawkins and Sutton, 2016</a>).</p><div class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" id="_idContainer039"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-20" id="figure-1-11" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_1_11.png"></span></span></strong><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Figure 1.11 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Choice of baseline matters when comparing observations and model simulations. </span>Global mean surface air temperature (GSAT, grey) from a range of CMIP6 historical simulations (1850–2014; 25 models) and SSP1-2.6 (2015–2100) using absolute values<span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> (top) </span>and anomalies relative to two different baselines: 1850–1900<span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> (middle) </span>and 1995–2014<span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> (bottom)</span>.

However, for situations where there are important thresholds (e.g., phase transitions around 0°C) or for variables which can only take a particular sign or be in a fixed range (e.g., sea ice extent or relative humidity), absolute values are normally used.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The choice of a baseline period has important consequences for evaluating both observations and simulations of the climate, for comparing observations with simulations, and for presenting climate projections. There is usually no perfect choice of baseline as many factors have to be considered and compromises may be required (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hawkins--2016">Hawkins and Sutton, 2016</a>). It is important to evaluate the sensitivity of an analysis or assessment to the choice of the baseline.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">For example, the collocation of observations and reanalyses within the model ensemble spread depends on the choice of the baseline, and uncertainty in future projections of climate is reduced if using a more recent baseline, especially for the near term (Figure 1.11). The length of an appropriate baseline or reference period depends on the variable being considered, the rates of change of the variable and the purpose of the chosen period, but is usually 20 to 50 years long. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) uses 30-year periods to define ‘climate normals’, which indicate conditions expected to be experienced in a given location.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">For AR6WGI, the period 1995–2014 is used as a baseline to calculate the changes in future climate using model projections and also as a ‘modern’ or ‘recent past’ reference period when estimating past observed warming. The equivalent period in AR5 was 1986–2005, and in SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL it was 2006–2015. The primary reason for the different choice in AR6 is that 2014 is the final year of the historical CMIP6 simulations. These simulations subsequently assume different emissions scenarios and so choosing any later baseline end date would require selecting a particular emissions scenario. For certain assessments, the most recent decade possible (e.g., 2010–2019 or 2011–2020, depending on the availability of observations) is also used as a reference period (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Figure 1.12 shows changes in observed global mean surface temperature (GMST) relative to 1850–1900 and illustrates observed global warming levels for a range of reference periods that are either used in AR6 or were used in previous IPCC reports. This allows changes to be calculated between different periods and compared to previous assessments. For example, AR5 assessed the change in GMST from the 1850–1900 baseline to 1986–2005 reference period as 0.61 [0.55 to 0.67] °C, whereas it is now assessed to be 0.69 [0.52 to 0.82] °C using improved GMST datasets (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3).</p><div class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" id="_idContainer041"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-21" id="figure-1-12" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_1_12.png"></span></span></strong><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Figure 1.12 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Global warming over the instrumental period. </span>Observed global mean surface temperature (GMST) from four datasets, relative to the average temperature of 1850–1900 in each dataset (see Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 and <a class="section-link" data-title="Surface Temperatures" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.1.1">Section 2.3.1.1</a> for more details).

Although GMST and GSAT are closely related, the two measures are physically distinct. GMST is a combination of land surface air temperature (LSAT) and sea surface temperature (SST), whereas GSAT is surface air temperatures over land, ocean and ice. A key development in AR6 is the assessment that long-term changes in GMST and GSAT differ by at most 10% in either direction, with <i class="•-Condensed-italic">low confidence</i> in the sign of any differences (see Cross Chapter Box 2.3 for details).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1">Three future reference periods are used in AR6 WGI for presenting projections: <i class="•-Condensed-italic">near term</i> (2021–2040), <i class="•-Condensed-italic">mid-term</i> (2041–2060) and <i class="•-Condensed-italic">long-term</i> (2081–2100; Figure 1.11).

This is a pragmatic choice based upon data availability considerations, though both anthropogenic and natural changes to the climate occurred before 1850. The remaining carbon budgets, the chance of crossing global temperature thresholds, and projections of extremes and sea level rise at a particular level of global warming can all be sensitive to the chosen definition of the approximate pre-industrial baseline (<a class="reference-link" href="#Millar--2017b">Millar et al., 2017b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schurer--2017">Schurer et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pfleiderer--2018">Pfleiderer et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rogelj--2019">Rogelj et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tokarska--2019">Tokarska et al., 2019</a>).

In line with this, previous IPCC assessment reports considered changes in radiative forcing relative to 1750, and temperature changes were often reported relative to the ‘late 19th century’. The AR5 and SR1.5 made the specific pragmatic choice to approximate pre-industrial global temperatures by using the average of the 1850<span class="CharOverride-5">–</span>1900 period, when permanent surface observing networks emerged that provide sufficiently accurate and continuous measurements on a near-global scale (Sections <a class="section-link" data-title="Lines of Evidence: Instrumental Observations" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.3.1">1.3.1</a> and <a class="section-link" data-title="Surface Temperatures" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.1.1">2.3.1.1</a>), and because model simulations of the historical period used 1850 as their start date. For the same reasons, to ensure continuity with previous assessments, and because of larger uncertainties and lower confidence in climatic changes before 1850 than after, AR6 makes the same choice to approximate pre-industrial global temperatures by using the the average of the 1850–1900 period.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body ParaOverride-4">Here weassess improvements in our understanding of climatic changes in the period 1750–1850.

The relative importance of these two factors depends on the climate variable or region of interest. Natural variations consist of both natural radiatively forced trends (e.g., due to volcanic eruptions or solar variations) and ‘internal’ fluctuations of the climate system which occur even in the absence of any radiative forcings. The internal ‘modes of variability’, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), are discussed further in Annex IV.</p><div class="h3-container" id="1.4.2.1"><h3 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">1.4.2.1 Climate Variability Can Influence Trends Over Short Periods<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-13-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Natural variations in both weather and longer time scale phenomena can temporarily mask or enhance any anthropogenic trends (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Deser--2012">Deser et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kay--2015">Kay et al., 2015</a>). These effects are more important on small spatial and temporal scales but can also occur on the global scale (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Since AR5, many studies have examined the role of internal variability through the use of ‘large ensembles’. Each such ensemble consists of many different simulations by a single climate model for the same time period and using the same radiative forcings. These simulations differ only in their phasing of the internal climate variations (also see <a class="section-link" data-title="Ensemble Modelling Techniques" href="#1.5.4.2">Section 1.5.4.2</a>). A set of illustrative examples using one such large ensemble (<a class="reference-link" href="#Maher--2019">Maher et al., 2019</a>) demonstrates how variability can influence trends on decadal time scales (Figure 1.13). The long-term anthropogenic trends in this set of climate indicators are clearly apparent when considering the ensemble as a whole (grey shading), and all the individual ensemble members have very similar trends for ocean heat content (OHC), which is a robust estimate of the total energy stored in the climate system (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Palmer--2014">Palmer and McNeall, 2014</a>). However, the individual ensemble members can exhibit very different decadal trends in global surface air temperature (GSAT), UK summer temperatures, and Arctic sea ice variations. More specifically, for a representative 11-year period, both positive and negative trends can be found in all these surface indicators, even though the long-term trend is for increasing temperatures and decreasing sea ice. Periods in which the long-term trend is substantially masked or enhanced for more than 20 years are also visible in these regional examples. This highlights the fact that observations are expected to exhibit short-term trends which are larger or smaller than the long-term trend or that differ from the average projected trend from climate models, especially on continental spatial scales or smaller (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1). The actual observed trajectory can be considered as one realization of many possible alternative worlds that experienced different weather; this is also demonstrated by the construction of ‘observation-based large ensembles’, which are alternate possible realizations of historical observations that retain the statistical properties of observed regional weather (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#McKinnon--2018">McKinnon and Deser, 2018</a>).</p><div class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" id="_idContainer043"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-22" id="figure-1-13" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_1_13.png"></span></span></strong><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Figure 1.13 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Simulated changes in various climate indicators under historical and RCP4.5 scenarios using the MPI ESM Grand Ensemble. </span> The grey shading shows the 5–95% range from the 100-member ensemble.

At the time it was unclear whether the observed changes were part of a longer-term trend or a natural fluctuation; the ‘signal’ had not yet clearly emerged from the ‘noise’ of natural variability.

In this Report emergence of a climate change signal or trend refers to when a change in climate (the ‘signal’) becomes larger than the amplitude of natural or internal variations (defining the ‘noise’). This concept is often expressed as a ‘signal-to-noise’ ratio (S/N) and emergence occurs at a defined threshold of this ratio (e.g., S/N &gt;1 or 2). Emergence can be estimated using observations and/or model simulations and can refer to changes relative to a historical or modern baseline (Section 12.5.2 and Glossary). The concept can also be expressed in terms of time (the ‘time of emergence’; Glossary) or in terms of a global warming level (Section 11.2.5; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kirchmeier-Young--2019">Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019</a>) and is also used to refer to a time when we can expect to see a response of mitigation activities that reduce emissions of GHGs or enhance their sinks (emergence with respect to mitigation; <a class="section-link" data-title="Emergence of the Climate Response to Mitigation" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4#4.6.3.1">Section 4.6.3.1</a>). Whenever possible, emergence should be discussed in the context of a clearly defined level of S/N or other quantification, such as ‘the signal has emerged at the level of S/N &gt;2’, rather than as a simple binary statement.

There is a growing focus on explaining and exploring complex physical chains of events or on predicting climate under various future socio-economic developments. Since AR5, ‘storylines’ or ‘narratives’ approaches have been used to better inform risk assessment and decision-making, to assist understanding of regional processes, and represent and communicate climate projection uncertainties more clearly. The aim is to help build a cohesive overall picture of potential climate change pathways that moves beyond the presentation of data and figures (Glossary; Fløttum and Gjerstad, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Moezzi--2017">Moezzi et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dessai--2018">Dessai et al., 2018</a>; T.G. <a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2018"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2018">Shepherd et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">In the broader IPCC context, the term ‘scenario storyline’ refers to a narrative description of one or more scenarios, highlighting their main characteristics, relationships between key driving forces and the dynamics of their evolution (e.g., emissions of short-lived climate forcers assessed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Short-lived Climate Forcers" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-6">Chapter 6</a> are driven by ‘scenario storylines’; see <a class="section-link" data-title="Dimensions of Integration: Scenarios, Global Warming Levels and Cumulative Carbon Emissions" href="#1.6">Section 1.6</a>). The AR6 WGI is mainly concerned with ‘physical climate storylines’. A physical climate storyline is a self-consistent and plausible physical trajectory of the climate system, or a weather or climate event, on time scales from hours to multiple decades (T.G. <a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2018"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2018">Shepherd et al., 2018</a>). This approach can be used to constrain projected changes or specific events on specified explanatory elements such as projected changes of large-scale indicators (Box 10.2). For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Hazeleger--2015">Hazeleger et al. (2015)</a> suggested using ‘tales of future weather’, blending numerical weather prediction with a climate projection to illustrate the potential behaviour of future high-impact events (also see <a class="reference-link" href="#Hegdahl--2020">Hegdahl et al., 2020</a>). Several studies describe how possible large changes in atmospheric circulation would affect regional precipitation and other climate variables, and discuss the various climate drivers that could cause such a circulation response (<a class="reference-link" href="#James--2015">James et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zappa--2017">Zappa and Shepherd, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mindlin--2020">Mindlin et al., 2020</a>). Physical climate storylines can also help frame the causal factors of extreme weather events (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2016">Shepherd, 2016</a>) and then be linked to event attribution (Section 11.2.2 and Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Storyline approaches can be used to communicate and contextualize climate change information in the context of risk for policymakers and practitioners (Box 10.2; e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Bruijn--2016">de Bruijn et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dessai--2018">Dessai et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Scott--2018">Scott et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jack--2020">Jack et al., 2020</a>).

These aspects are important as the greatest risk need not be associated with the highest-likelihood outcome, and in fact will often be associated with low-likelihood outcomes. The storyline approach can also acknowledge that climate-relevant decisions in a risk-oriented framing will rarely be taken on the basis of physical climate change alone; instead, such decisions will normally take into account socio-economic factors as well (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2019">Shepherd, 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">In the AR6 WGIAssessment Report, these different storyline approaches are used in several places (see Table 1.1). <a class="section-link" data-title="Future Global Climate: Scenario-based Projections and Near-term Information" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4">Chapter 4</a> uses a storyline approach to assess the upper tail of the distribution of global warming levels (the storylines of high global warming levels) and their manifestation in global patterns of temperature and precipitation changes. <a class="section-link" data-title="Ocean, Cryosphere and Sea Level Change" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-9">Chapter 9</a> uses a storyline approach to examine the potential for, and early warning signals of, a high-end sea level scenario, in the context of deep uncertainty related to our current understanding of the physical processes that contribute to long-term sea level rise. <a class="section-link" data-title="Linking Global to Regional Climate Change" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-10">Chapter 10</a> assesses the use of physical climate storylines and narratives as a way to explore uncertainties in regional climate projections, and to link to the specific risk and decision context relevant to a user, for developing integrated and context-relevant regional climate change information. <a class="section-link" data-title="Weather and Climate Extreme Events in a Changing Climate" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11">Chapter 11</a> uses the term storyline in the framework of extreme event attribution. <a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Change Information for Regional Impact and for Risk Assessment" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-12">Chapter 12</a> assesses the use of a storylines approach with narrative elements for communicating climate (change) information in the context of climate services (Cross-Chapter Box 12.2).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="1.4.4.3"><h3 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">1.4.4.3 Abrupt Change, Tipping Points and Surprises<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-19-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">An ‘abrupt change’<i class="•-Condensed-italic"></i> is defined in this report as a change that takes place substantially faster than the rate of change in the recent history of the affected component of a system (Glossary).

However, there is no evidence of such non-linear responses at the global scale in climate projections for the next century, which indicates a near-linear dependence of global temperature on cumulative GHG emissions (Sections 1.3.5, 5.5 and 7.4.3.1). At the regional scale, abrupt changes and tipping points, such as Amazon rainforest dieback and permafrost collapse, have occurred in projections with Earth System Models (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Change Beyond 2100" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.3">Section 4.7.3</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Drijfhout--2015">Drijfhout et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bathiany--2020">Bathiany et al., 2020</a>). In such simulations, tipping points occur in narrow regions of parameter space (e.g., CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> concentration or temperature increase), and for specific climate background states. This makes them difficult to predict using Earth system models (ESMs) relying on parmeterizations of known processes. In some cases, it is possible to detect forthcoming tipping points through time-series analysis that identifies increased sensitivity to perturbations as the tipping point is approached (e.g., ‘critical slowing-down’, <a class="reference-link" href="#Scheffer--2012">Scheffer et al., 2012</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Some suggested climate tipping points prompt transitions from one steady state to another (Figure 1.17). Transitions can be prompted by perturbations such as climate extremes which force the system outside of its current well of attraction in the stability landscape; this is called noise-induced tipping (Figure 1.17a,b; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ashwin--2012">Ashwin et al., 2012</a>). For example, the tropical forest dieback seen in some ESM projections is accelerated by longer and more frequent droughts over tropical land (<a class="reference-link" href="#Good--2013">Good et al., 2013</a>).</p><div class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" id="_idContainer051"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns ParaOverride-8" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-26" id="figure-1-17" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_1_17.png"></span></span></strong><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Figure 1.17 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Illustration of two types of tipping points: noise-induced (a, b) and bifurcation (c, d). </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> (a) </span> and <span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> (c) </span> are example time-series (coloured lines) through the tipping point, with solid-black lines indicating stable climate states (e.g., low or high rainfall) and dashed lines representing the boundary between stable states. <span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> (b) </span> and <span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> (d) </span> are stability landscapes, which provide an intuitive understanding of the different types of tipping point. The ‘valleys’ represent different climate states the system can occupy, with ‘hilltops’ separating the stable states. The resilience of a climate state is implied by the depth of the valley. The current state of the system is represented by a ball. Both scenarios assume that the ball starts in the left-hand valley (dashed-black lines) and then through different mechanisms dependent on the type of tipping transitions to the right-hand valley (coloured lines). Noise-induced tipping events (a, b), for instance drought events causing sudden dieback of the Amazon rainforest, develop from fluctuations within the system. The stability landscape in this scenario remains fixed and stationary. A series of perturbations in the same direction, or one large perturbation, are required to force the system over the hilltop and into the alternative stable state. Bifurcation tipping events (c, d), such as a collapse of the thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic Ocean under climate change, occur when a critical level in the forcing is reached. Here the stability landscape is subjected to a change in shape. Under gradual anthropogenic forcing the left-hand valley begins to shallow and eventually vanishes at the tipping point, forcing the system to transition to the right-hand valley. </strong></div><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Alternatively, transitions from one state to another can occur if a critical threshold is exceeded; this is called ‘bifurcation tipping’ (Figure 1.17c,d; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ashwin--2012">Ashwin et al., 2012</a>). The new state is defined as ‘irreversible’ on a given time scale if the recovery from this state takes substantially longer than the time scale of interest, which is decades to centuries for the projections presented in this report.

The terminology of ‘climatic impact-driver’ therefore allows WGI to provide a more value-neutral characterization of climatic changes that may be relevant for understanding potential impacts, without pre-judging whether specific climatic changes necessarily lead to adverse consequences, as some could also result in beneficial outcomes depending on the specific system and associated values. <a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Change Information for Regional Impact and for Risk Assessment" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-12">Chapter 12</a> and the <a class="section-link" data-title="Atlas" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/atlas">Atlas</a> assess and provide information on climatic impact-drivers for different regions and sectors to support and link to the WGII assessment of the impacts and risks (or opportunities) related to the changes in the climatic impact-drivers.

As another example, climate-related risk to food security can arise from both potential climate change impacts and responses to climate change and can be exacerbated by other stressors. Drivers for risks related to climate change impacts include climatic impact- drivers (e.g., drought, temperature extremes, humidity) mediated by other climatic impact-drivers (e.g., increased CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> fertilization of certain types of crops may help increase yields), the potential for indirect climate-related impacts (e.g., pest outbreaks triggered by ecosystem responses to weather patterns), exposure of people (e.g., how many people depend on a particular crop) and vulnerability or adaptability (how able are affected people to substitute other sources of food, which may be related to financial access and markets).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">Information provided by WGI may or may not be relevant to understand risks related to climate change responses. For example, the risk to a company arising from emissions pricing, or the societal risk from reliance on an unproven mitigation technology, is not directly dependent on actual or projected changes in climate but arise largely from human choices. However, WGI climate information may be relevant to understand the potential for maladaptation, such as the potential for specific adaptation responses not achieving the desired outcome or having negative side effects.

Typical questions addressed by the IPCC include: ‘To what extent is an observed change in global temperature induced by anthropogenic GHG and aerosol concentration changes, or influenced by natural variability?’ and ‘What is the contribution of climate change to observed changes in crop yields, which are also influenced by changes in agricultural management?’ Changes in the occurrence and intensity of extreme events can also be attributed, addressing questions such as: ‘Have human GHG emissions increased the likelihood or intensity of an observed heatwave?’</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">This Cross-Working Group Box briefly describes why attribution studies are important.

The most established method is to identify the ‘fingerprint’ of the expected space-time response to a particular climate forcing agent such as the concentration of anthropogenically induced GHGs or aerosols, or natural variation of solar radiation. This technique disentangles the contribution of individual forcing agents to an observed change (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Gillett--2021">Gillett et al., 2021</a>). New statistical approaches have been applied to better account for internal climate variability and the uncertainties in models and observations<span lang="en-US"> (WGI <a class="section-link" data-title="Methods" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-3#3.2">Section 3.2</a>; e.g., Naveau</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2018; Santer</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2019)</span>. There are many other approaches, for example, global mean sea level change has been attributed to anthropogenic climate forcing by attributing the individual contributions from, for example, glacier melt or thermal expansion, while also examining which aspects of the observed change are inconsistent with internal variability (WGI Sections 3.5.2 and 9.6.1.4).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">Specific regional conditions and responses may simplify or complicate attribution on those scales. For example, some human forcings, such as regional land-use change or aerosols, may enhance or reduce regional signals of change (WGI Sections 10.4.2, 11.1.6 and 11.2.2; <span lang="en-US">Lejeune</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2018; Undorf </span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2018; Boé</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2020; Thiery</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2020)</span>. In general, regional climate variations are larger than the global mean climate, adding additional uncertainty to attribution (e.g., in regional sea level change, WGI Section 9.6.1). These statistical limitations may be reduced by ‘process-based attribution’, focusing on the physical processes known to influence the response to external forcing and internal variability (WGI Section 10.4.2).</p><h2 class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-H2">Attribution of weather and climate events to anthropogenic forcing</h2><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body">New methods have emerged since AR5 to attribute the change in likelihood or characteristics of weather or climate events or classes of events to underlying drivers (WGI Sections 10.4.1 and 11.2.2; <span lang="en-US"><a class="reference-link" href="#NA%20SEM--2016">NA SEM, 2016</a>; Stott </span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2016; Jézéquel</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2018; Wehner</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2018; Wang</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2021)</span>. Typically, historical changes, simulated under observed forcings, are compared to a counterfactual climate simulated in the absence of anthropogenic forcing. Another approach examines facets of the weather and thermodynamic status of an event through process-based attribution (WGI <a class="section-link" data-title="Weather and Climate Extreme Events in a Changing Climate" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11">Chapter 11</a> and Section 10.4.1; <span lang="en-US">Hauser</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2016; Shepherd</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2018; Grose</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2019)</span>.

New studies include the attribution of changes in socio-economic indicators such as economic damages due to river floods (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Schaller--2016">Schaller et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sauer--2021">Sauer et al., 2021</a>), the occurrence of heat-related human mortality (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Vicedo-Cabrera--2018">Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sera--2020">Sera et al., 2020</a>) or economic inequality (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Diffenbaugh--2019">Diffenbaugh and Burke, 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body ParaOverride-1">Impact attribution covers a diverse set of qualitative and quantitative approaches, building on experimental approaches, observations from remote sensing, long-term in situ observations, and monitoring efforts, teamed with local knowledge, process understanding and empirical or dynamical modelling (WGII Section 16.2; <a class="reference-link" href="#Stone--2013">Stone et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cramer--2014">Cramer et al., 2014</a>). The attribution of a change in a natural or human system (e.g., wild species, natural ecosystems, crop yields, economic development, infrastructure or human health) to changes in climate-related systems (i.e., climate, ocean acidification, permafrost thawing or sea level rise) requires accounting for other potential drivers of change, such as technological and economic changes in agriculture affecting crop production (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hochman--2017">Hochman et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Butler--2018">Butler et al., 2018</a>), changes in human population patterns and vulnerability affecting flood- or wildfire-induced damages (<a class="reference-link" href="#Huggel--2015">Huggel et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sauer--2021">Sauer et al., 2021</a>), or habitat loss driving declines in wild species (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPBES--2019">IPBES, 2019</a>). These drivers are accounted for by estimating a baseline condition that would exist in the absence of climate change. The baseline might be stationary and be approximated by observations from the past, or it may change over time and be simulated by statistical or process-based impact models (WGII Section 16.2; <span lang="en-US">Cramer</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2014)</span>.

A fundamental aspect of the study of regional climate changes is the definition of characteristic climate zones, clusters or regions, across which the emergent climate change signal can be properly analysed and projected (see Atlas).

In AR6, reanalyses provide information for fields and in regions where observations are limited. There is growing confidence that modern reanalyses can provide another line of evidence in describing recent temperature trends (Tables 2.4 and 2.5). As their spatial resolution increases, the exploration of fine-scale extremes in both space and time becomes possible (e.g., wind; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kaiser-Weiss--2015">Kaiser-Weiss et al., 2015</a>).

Since AR5, new reanalyses have been developed with various combinations of increased resolution, extended records, more consistent data assimilation, estimation of uncertainty arising from the range of initial conditions, and an improved representation of the atmosphere or ocean system.

When these are met the model is released for use in intercomparisons such as CMIP. Tuning targets can be one of three types: mean climate; regional phenomena and features; or historical trends (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hourdin--2017">Hourdin et al., 2017</a>). One example of such a goal is that when the simulated climate system receives energy from the sun in accordance with what we observe today, the resulting mean equilibrium temperature should also be close to observations. Whether tuning should be performed to facilitate accurate simulation of long-term trends such as changes in global mean temperature over the historical era, or rather be performed for each process independently such that all collective behaviour is emergent, is an open question (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schmidt--2017">Schmidt et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Burrows--2018">Burrows et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Each modelling group has its own strategy and, after AR5, a survey was conducted to understand the tuning approach used in 23 CMIP5 modelling centres. The results are discussed in <a class="reference-link" href="#Hourdin--2017">Hourdin et al. (2017)</a>, which stresses that the behaviour of ESMs depends on the tuning strategy. An important recommendation is that the calibration steps that lead to particular model tuning should be carefully documented. In CMIP6 each modelling group now describes the three levels of tuning, both for the complete ESM and for the individual components (available at <a href="https://explore.es-doc.org"><span class="•-Hyperlink--blue---underline-">https://explore.es-doc.org</span></a>and in the published model descriptions, Annex II: Models). The most important global tuning target for CMIP6 models is the net top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) heat flux and its radiative components. Other global targets include: the decomposition of the energy fluxes at TOA into a clear sky component and a component due to the radiative effect of clouds, global mean air and ocean temperature, sea ice extent, sea ice volume, glacial mass balance, and the global root mean square error of precipitation. The TOA heat flux balance is achieved using a diversity of approaches, usually unique to each modelling group. Adjustments are made for parameters associated with uncertain or poorly constrained processes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schmidt--2017">Schmidt et al., 2017</a>), for example the aerosol indirect effects, adjustments to ocean albedo, marine dimethyl sulfide (DMS) parameterization, or cloud properties (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mauritsen--2020">Mauritsen and Roeckner, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Regional tuning targets include: the AMOC, the Southern Ocean circulation, and temperature profiles in ocean basins (<a class="reference-link" href="#Golaz--2019">Golaz et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sellar--2019">Sellar et al., 2019</a>); regional land properties and precipitations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mauritsen--2019">Mauritsen et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yukimoto--2019">Yukimoto et al., 2019</a>) ; latitudinal distribution of radiation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Boucher--2020">Boucher et al., 2020</a>); spatial contrasts in TOA radiative fluxes or surface fluxes; and stationary waves in the Northern Hemisphere (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schmidt--2017">Schmidt et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yukimoto--2019">Yukimoto et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Even with some core commonalities of approaches to model tuning, practices can differ, such as the use of initial drift from initialized forecasts, the explicit use of the transient observed record for the historical period, or the use of the present-day radiative imbalance at the TOA as a tuning target rather than an equilibrated pre-industrial balance. The majority of CMIP6 modelling groups report that they do not tune their model for the observed trends during the historical period (23 out of 29 groups), nor for ECS (25 out of 29). ECS and TCR are thus emergent properties for a large majority of models. The effect of tuning on model skill and ensemble spread in CMIP6 is further discussed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Human Influence on the Atmosphere and Surface" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-3#3.3">Section 3.3</a>.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="1.5.3.3"><h3 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">1.5.3.3 From Global to Regional Models<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-31-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The need for accurate climate information at the regional scale is increasing (Section 10.1). High-resolution global climate models, such as those taking part in HighResMIP, provide more detailed information at the regional scale (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2018">Roberts et al., 2018</a>). However, due to the large computational resources required by these models, only a limited number of simulations per model are available. In addition to CMIP global models, regional information can be derived using regional climate models (RCMs) and downscaling techniques, presented in <a class="section-link" data-title="Linking Global to Regional Climate Change" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-10">Chapter 10</a> and the Atlas. RCMs are dynamical models, similar to GCMs, that simulate a limited region and are forced with boudary conditions from a global simulation, often correcting for biases (Section 10.3, Cross-Chapter Box 10.2 and Annex II). This approach allows the use of a higher resolution within the chosen domain, and thus better represents important drivers of regional climate such as mountain ranges, land management and urban effects. RCMs resolving atmospheric convection explicitly are now included in intercomparisons (<a class="reference-link" href="#Coppola--2020">Coppola et al., 2020</a>) and are used in Chapters 10, 11 and 12.

EMICs are simplified; they include processes in a more parameterized, rather than explicitly calculated, form and generally have lower spatial resolution compared to the complex ESMs. As a result, EMICs require much less computational resource and can be integrated for many thousands of years without supercomputers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hajima--2014">Hajima et al., 2014</a>). The range of EMICs used in climate change research is highly heterogeneous, ranging from zonally averaged or mixed-layer ocean models coupled to statistical-dynamical models of the atmosphere, to low-resolution three-dimensional ocean models coupled to simplified dynamical models of the atmosphere. An increasing number of EMICs include interactive representations of the global carbon cycle, with varying levels of complexity and numbers of processes considered (<a class="reference-link" href="#Plattner--2008">Plattner et al., 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zickfeld--2013">Zickfeld et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#MacDougall--2020">MacDougall et al., 2020</a>).

More recently, a number of studies have pointed to the possibility of systematically different climate responses to external forcings in EMICs and complex ESMs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fr%C3%B6licher--2015">Frölicher and Paynter, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pfister--2017">Pfister and Stocker, 2017</a>, 2018) that need to be considered in the context of this report. For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Fr%C3%B6licher--2015">Frölicher and Paynter (2015)</a> showed that EMICs have a higher simulated realized warming fraction (i.e., the TCR/ECS ratio) than CMIP5 ESMs and speculated that this may bias the temperature response to zero carbon emissions.

While some EMICs contribute to parts of the CMIP6-endorsed MIPs, a coordinated EMICs modelling effort similar to those carried out for AR4 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Plattner--2008">Plattner et al., 2008</a>) and AR5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eby--2013">Eby et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zickfeld--2013">Zickfeld et al., 2013</a>) is not in place for IPCC AR6; however, EMICs are assessed in a number of chapters. For example, Chapters 4 and 5 use EMICs in the assessment of long-term climate change beyond 2100 (Section 5.5); zero-emissions commitments, overshoot and recovery (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Change Beyond 2100" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4#4.7">Section 4.7</a>); consequences of CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> removal (CDR) on the climate system and the carbon cycle (Sections 4.6 and 5.6); and long-term carbon cycle–climate feedbacks (Section 5.4).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed">Physical emulators and simple climate models</span>make up a broad class of heavily parametrized models designed to reproduce the responses of the more complex, process-based models, and provide rapid translations of emissions, via concentrations and radiative forcing, into probabilistic estimates of changes to the physical climate system. The main application of emulators is to extrapolate insights from ESMs and observational constraints to a larger set of emissions scenarios (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1). The computational efficiency of various emulating approaches opens new analytical possibilities, given that ESMs take a lot of computational resources for each simulation. The applicability and usefulness of emulating approaches are however constrained by their skill in capturing the global mean climate responses simulated by the ESMs (mainly limited to global mean or hemispheric land/ocean temperatures) and by their ability to extrapolate skilfully outside the calibrated range.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The terms ‘emulator’ and ‘simple climate model’ (SCM) are different, although they are sometimes used interchangeably. SCM refers to a broad class of lower-dimensional models of the energy balance, radiative transfer, carbon cycle, or a combination of such physical components. SCMs can also be tuned to reproduce the calculations of climate-mean variables of a given ESM, assuming that their structural flexibility can capture both the parametric and structural uncertainties across process-oriented ESM responses. When run in this setup, they are termed emulators. Simple climate models do not have to be run in ‘emulation’ mode, though, as they can also be used to test consistency across multiple lines of evidence with regard to ranges in ECS, TCR, TCRE and carbon cycle feedbacks (Chapters 5 and 7). Physical emulation can also be performed with very simple parameterizations (‘one-or-few-line climate models’), statistical methods like neural networks, genetic algorithms, or other artificial intelligence approaches, where the emulator behaviour is explicitly tuned to reproduce the response of a given ESM or model ensemble (Chapters 4, 5 and 7).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Current emulators and SCMs include the generic impulse response model outlined in <a class="section-link" data-title="Water Cycle Changes" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-8">Chapter 8</a> of AR5 (AR5-IR; Supplementary Material 8.SM.11 of <a class="reference-link" href="#Myhre--2013">Myhre et al., 2013</a>), two-layer models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Held--2010">Held et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rohrschneider--2019">Rohrschneider et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nicholls--2020">Nicholls et al., 2020</a>), and higher-complexity approaches that include upwelling, diffusion and entrainment in the ocean component (e.g., MAGICC Version 5.3 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Raper--2001">Raper et al., 2001</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wigley--2009">Wigley et al., 2009</a>); Version 6/7 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Meinshausen--2011a">Meinshausen et al., 2011a</a>); <span class="•-Bold-condensed"></span>OSCAR<span class="•-Bold-condensed"></span>(<a class="reference-link" href="#Gasser--2017">Gasser et al., 2017</a>); CICERO SCM<span class="•-Bold-condensed"></span>(<a class="reference-link" href="#Skeie--2017">Skeie et al., 2017</a>); FaIR (<a class="reference-link" href="#Millar--2017a">Millar et al., 2017a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Smith--2018">Smith et al., 2018</a>); and a range of statistical approaches (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schwarber--2019">Schwarber et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Beusch--2020b">Beusch et al., 2020b</a>).

Different purposes motivating development include: being as simple as possible for teaching purposes (e.g., a two-layer energy balance model); being as comprehensive as possible to allow for propagation of uncertainties across multiple Earth system domains (MAGICC and others); or focusing on higher-complexity representation of specific domains (e.g., OSCAR). The common theme motivating many models is to improve parameterizations that reflect the latest findings in complex ESM interactions – such as the nitrogen cycle addition to the carbon cycle, or tropospheric and stratospheric ozone exchange – with the aim of emulating their global mean temperature response. Also, within the simple models that have a rudimentary representation of spatial heterogeneity (e.g., four-box simple climate models), the ambition is to represent heterogeneous forcers such as black carbon more adequately (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stjern--2017">Stjern et al., 2017</a>), provide an appropriate representation of the forcing–feedback framework (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Sherwood--2015">Sherwood et al., 2015</a>), investigate new parameterizations of ocean heat uptake, and implement better representations of volcanic aerosol-induced cooling (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gregory--2016a">Gregory et al., 2016a</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">MAGICC (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wigley--2009">Wigley et al., 2009</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Meinshausen--2011a">Meinshausen et al., 2011a</a>) and FaIR (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smith--2018">Smith et al., 2018</a>) were used in IPCC SR1.5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC, 2018</a>) to categorize mitigation pathways into classes of scenarios that peak near 1.5°C, overshoot 1.5°C, or stay below 2°C.

Changes to a model that enhance its fitness for one purpose can sometimes decrease its fitness for others, by upsetting a pre-existing balance of approximations. When it is unclear whether a model is fit for a purpose of interest, there is often a closely related purpose for which the evidence of fitness is clearer. For example, it might be unclear whether a model is fit for providing highly accurate projections of precipitation changes in a region, but reasonable to think that the model is fit for providing projections of precipitation changes that cannot yet be ruled out (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parker--2009">Parker, 2009</a>). Such information about plausible or credible changes can be useful to inform adaptation.

These simulations have typically been performed by separate models with consistent boundary conditions and prescribed emissions or radiative forcings, as in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases (CMIP, <a class="reference-link" href="#Meehl--2000">Meehl et al., 2000</a>, 2007a; <a class="reference-link" href="#Taylor--2012">Taylor et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Eyring--2016">Eyring et al., 2016</a>). Such multi-model ensembles (MMEs) have proven highly useful in sampling and quantifying model uncertainty, within and between generations of climate models. They also reduce the influence on projections of the particular sets of parametrizations and physical components simulated by individual models. The primary usage of MMEs is to provide a well-quantified model range, but when used carefully they can also increase confidence in projections (<a class="reference-link" href="#Knutti--2010">Knutti et al., 2010</a>). Presently, however, many models also share provenance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Masson--2011">Masson and Knutti, 2011</a>) and may have common biases that should be acknowledged when presenting and building on MME-derived conclusions (<a class="section-link" data-title="Evaluation of Process-Based Models Against Observations" href="#1.5.4.6">Section 1.5.4.6</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bo%C3%A9--2018">Boé, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Abramowitz--2019">Abramowitz et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Since AR5, an increase in computing power has made it possible to investigate simulated internal variability and to provide robust estimates of forced model responses, using large initial condition ensembles (ICEs), also referred to as single model initial condition large ensembles (SMILEs). Examples using GCMs or ESMs that support assessments in AR6 include the CESM Large Ensemble (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kay--2015">Kay et al., 2015</a>), the MPI Grand Ensemble (<a class="reference-link" href="#Maher--2019">Maher et al., 2019</a>), and the CanESM2 large ensembles (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kirchmeier-Young--2017">Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2017</a>). Such ensembles employ a single GCM or ESM in a fixed configuration, but starting from a variety of different initial states. In some experiments, these initial states only differ slightly. As the climate system is chaotic, such tiny changes in initial conditions lead to different evolutions for the individual realizations of the system as a whole. Other experiments start from a set of well-separated ocean initial conditions to sample the uncertainty in the circulation state of the ocean and its role in longer-time scale variations. These two types of ICEs have been referred to as ‘micro’ and ‘macro’ perturbation ensembles respectively (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hawkins--2016">Hawkins et al., 2016</a>).

Statistical methods can then be used to detect which parameters are the main causes of uncertainty across the ensemble. PPEs have been used frequently in simpler models, such as EMICs, and are being applied to more complex models. A caveat of PPEs is that the estimated uncertainty will depend on the specific parameterizations of the underlying model and may well be an underestimation of the ‘true’ uncertainty. It is also challenging to disentangle forced responses from internal variability using a PPE alone.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Together, the three ensemble methods (MMEs, ICEs, PPEs) allow investigation of climate model uncertainty arising from internal variability, initial and internal boundary conditions, model formulations and parameterizations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parker--2013">Parker, 2013</a>).

Complex Earth system models (ESMs) simulate variations on time scales from hours to centuries, telling us how aspects of the current climate relate to its sensitivity to anthropogenic forcing. Where an ensemble of different ESMs displays a relationship between a short-term observable variation and a longer-term sensitivity, an observation of the short-term variation in the real world can be converted, via the model-based relationship, into an ‘emergent constraint’ on the sensitivity.

However, there is a chance that indiscriminate data-mining of the multi-dimensional outputs from ESMs could lead to spurious correlations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Caldwell--2014">Caldwell et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wagman--2018">Wagman and Jackson, 2018</a>) and less-than-robust emergent constraints on future changes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bracegirdle--2013">Bracegirdle and Stephenson, 2013</a>). To avoid this, emergent constraints need to be tested ‘out of sample’ on parts of the dataset that were not included in its construction (<a class="reference-link" href="#Caldwell--2018">Caldwell et al., 2018</a>) and should also always be based on sound physical understanding and mathematical theory (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hall--2019">Hall et al., 2019</a>). Their conclusions should also be reassessed when a new generation of MMEs becomes available, such as CMIP6.

This practice has been noted to diminish the influence of models exhibiting a good match with observations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tapiador--2020">Tapiador et al., 2020</a>). However, exceptions to this approach exist, notably AR5 projections of sea ice, which only selected a few models which passed a model performance assessment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Collins--2013">Collins et al., 2013</a>), and more studies on this topic have appeared since AR5 (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Eyring--2019">Eyring et al., 2019</a>). Ensembles are typically sub-selected by removing either poorly performing model simulations (<a class="reference-link" href="#McSweeney--2015">McSweeney et al., 2015</a>) or model simulations that are perceived to add little additional information, typically where multiple simulations have come from the same model.

However, models may share representations of processes, parameterization schemes, or even parts of code, leading to common biases. The models may therefore not be fully independent, calling into question inferences derived from multi-model ensembles (<a class="reference-link" href="#Abramowitz--2019">Abramowitz et al., 2019</a>). Emergent constraints (<a class="section-link" data-title="Model Evaluation Tools" href="#1.5.4.5">Section 1.5.4.5</a>) also represent an implicit weighting technique that explicitly links present performance to future projections (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bracegirdle--2013">Bracegirdle and Stephenson, 2013</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Concern has been raised about the large extent to which code is shared within the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sanderson--2015a">Sanderson et al., 2015a</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Bo%C3%A9--2018">Boé (2018)</a> showed that a clear relationship exists between the number of components shared by climate models and how similar the simulations are. The resulting similarities in behaviour need to be accounted for in the generation of best-estimate multi-model climate projections. This has led to calls to move beyond equally-weighted multi-model means towards weighted means that take into account both model performance and model independence (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sanderson--2015b">Sanderson et al., 2015b</a>, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Knutti--2017">Knutti et al., 2017</a>).

All three dimensions can, in principle, be used to synthesize physical science knowledge across WGI, and also across climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation research. Scenarios, in particular, have a long history of serving as a common reference point within and across IPCC Working Groups and research communities. Similarly, cumulative carbon emissions and global warming levels provide key links between WGI assessments and those of the other WGs; these two dimensions frame the cause–effect chain investigated by WGI. The closest links to WGIII are the emissions scenarios, as WGIII considers drivers of emissions and climate change mitigation options. The links to WGII are the geophysical climate projections from the Earth system models, which are often used as the starting point in the literature on climate impacts and adaptation.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">This section is structured as follows: first, the scenarios used in AR6 are introduced and discussed in relation to scenarios used in earlier IPCC assessments (<a class="section-link" data-title="Scenarios" href="#1.6.1">Section 1.6.1</a>).

Each pathway is an internally consistent, plausible and integrated description of a socio-economic future, but these socio-economic futures do not account for the effects of climate change, and no new climate policies are assumed. The SSPs’ quantitative projections of socio-economic drivers include population, gross domestic product (GDP) and urbanization (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dellink--2017">Dellink et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jiang--2017">Jiang and O’Neill, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Samir--2017">Samir and Lutz, 2017</a>).

Broadly, the five SSPs represent ‘sustainability’ (SSP1), a ‘middle-of-the-road’ path (SSP2), ‘regional rivalry’ (SSP3), ‘inequality’ (SSP4), and ‘fossil fuel-intensive’ development (SSP5; Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 1; <a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2017a">O’Neill et al., 2017a</a>). More specific information on the SSP framework and the assumptions underlying the SSPs will be provided in the IPCC WGIII report (WGIII Chapter 3; see also Box SPM.1 in SRCCL (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019d">IPCC, 2019d</a>)).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The SSP narratives and drivers were used to develop scenarios of energy use, air pollution control, land use, and GHG emissions developments using integrated assessment models (IAMs; <a class="reference-link" href="#Riahi--2017">Riahi et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rogelj--2018a">Rogelj et al., 2018a</a>).

More recently, and in particular since IPCC SR1.5 report focused attention on peak warming scenarios (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rogelj--2018b">Rogelj et al., 2018b</a>), scenario development started to explicitly consider peak warming, cumulative emissions and the amount of net negative emissions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rogelj--2018b">Rogelj et al., 2018b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fujimori--2019">Fujimori et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The SSP scenarios can be used for either emissions- or concentration-driven model experiments (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4). ESMs can be run with emissions and concentrations data for GHGs and aerosols and land-use or landcover maps and calculate levels of radiative forcing internally. The radiative forcing labels of the RCP and SSP scenarios, such as ‘2.6’ in RCP2.6 or SSP1-2.6, are thus approximate labels for the year 2100 only. The actual global mean effective radiative forcing varies across ESMs due to different radiative transfer schemes, uncertainties in aerosol–cloud interactions, and different feedback mechanisms, among other reasons. Nonetheless, using approximate radiative forcing labels is advantageous because it establishes a clear categorization of scenarios, with multiple climate forcings and different combinations in those scenarios summarized in a single number. The classifications according to cumulative carbon emissions (<a class="section-link" data-title="Cumulative Carbon Dioxide Emissions" href="#1.6.3">Section 1.6.3</a>) and global warming level (<a class="section-link" data-title="Global Warming Levels" href="#1.6.2">Section 1.6.2</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 on emulators) complement those forcing labels.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">A key advance of the SSP scenarios relative to the RCPs is a wider span of assumptions on future air-quality mitigation measures, and hence emissions of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rao--2017">Rao et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lund--2020">Lund et al., 2020</a>). This allows for a more detailed investigation into the relative roles of GHG and SLCF emissions in future global and regional climate change, and hence the implications of policy choices. For instance, SSP1-2.6 builds on an assumption of stringent air-quality mitigation policy, leading to rapid reductions in particle emissions, while SSP3-7.0 assumes slow improvements, with pollutant emissions over the 21st century comparable to current levels (Figure 6.19 and Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 2).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">One limitation of the SSP scenarios used for CMIP6 and in this Report is that they reduce emissions from all the major ozone-depleting substances controlled under the Montreal Protocol (CFCs, halons, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)) uniformly, rather than representing a fuller range of possible high- and low-emissions futures (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2016">UNEP, 2016</a>). Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions, on the other hand, span a wider range within the SSPs than in the RCPs (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 2).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The SSP scenarios and previous RCP scenarios are not directly comparable. First, the gas-to-gas compositions differ; for example, the SSP5-8.5 scenario has higher CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> concentrations but lower CH<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">4</sub> concentrations compared to RCP8.5. Second, the projected 21st-century trajectories may differ, even if they result in the same radiative forcing by 2100. Third, the overall effective radiative forcing (Chapter 7) may differ, and tends to be higher for the SSPs compared to RCPs that share the same nominal stratospheric-temperature-adjusted radiative forcing label. The stratospheric-temperature-adjusted radiative forcings of the SSPs and RCPs, however, remain relatively close, at least by 2100 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tebaldi--2021">Tebaldi et al., 2021</a>). In summary, differences in, for example, CMIP5 RCP8.5 and CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 ESM outputs, are partially due to different scenario characteristics rather than different ESM characteristics only (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Goals" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4#4.6.2">Section 4.6.2</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">When investigating various mitigation futures, WGIII goes beyond the core set of SSP scenarios assessed in WGI (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, etc.) to consider the characteristics of more than 1000 scenarios (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1). In addition, while staying within the framework of socio-economic development pathways (SSP1 to SSP5), WGIII also considers various mitigation possibilities through so-called illustrative pathways (IPs). These illustrative pathways help to highlight key narratives in the literature concerning various technological, social and behavioural options for mitigation, various timings for implementation, or varying emphasis on different GHG and land-use options. Just as with the SSPX-Y scenarios considered in this Report, these illustrative pathways can be placed in relation to the matrix of SSP families and approximate radiative forcing levels in 2100 (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 1; IPCC WGIII, Chapter 3).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1">No likelihood is attached to the scenarios assessed in this report, and the feasibility of specific scenarios in relation to current trends is best informed by the WGIII contribution to AR6.

Building on the SRES multi-gas scenarios, the RCPs include time series of emissions and concentrations of the full suite of GHGs, aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as land use and land cover (<a class="reference-link" href="#Moss--2010">Moss et al., 2010</a>). The word ‘representative’ signifies that each RCP is only one of many possible scenarios that would lead to the specific radiative forcing characteristics. The term ‘pathway’ emphasizes that not only the long-term concentration levels are of interest, but also the trajectory taken over time to reach that outcome (<a class="reference-link" href="#Moss--2010">Moss et al., 2010</a>). RCPs usually refer to the concentration pathway extending to 2100, for which IAMs produced corresponding emissions scenarios. Four RCPs produced from IAMs were selected from the published literature and are used in AR5 as well as in this report, spanning approximately the range from below 2°C warming to high (above 4°C) warming best-estimates by the end of the 21st century: RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Table 1). Extended Concentration Pathways (ECPs) describe extensions of the RCPs from 2100 to 2300 that were calculated using simple rules generated by stakeholder consultations; these do not represent fully consistent scenarios (<a class="reference-link" href="#Meinshausen--2011b">Meinshausen et al., 2011b</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">By design, theRCP emissions and concentrations pathways were originally developed using particular socio-economic development pathways, but those are no longer considered (<a class="reference-link" href="#Moss--2010">Moss et al., 2010</a>). The different levels of emissions and climate change represented in the RCPs can hence be explored against the backdrop of different socio-economic development pathways (SSP1 to SSP5; <a class="section-link" data-title="Shared Socio-economic Pathways" href="#1.6.1.1">Section 1.6.1.1</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 1.4). This integrative SSP-RCP framework (‘SSPX-RCPY’ in Table 1.4) is now widely used in the climate impact and policy analysis literature (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#ICONICS--2021">ICONICS, 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Green--2020">Green et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2020">O’Neill et al., 2020</a>), where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios are analysed against the backdrop of various SSPs. Considering various levels of future emissions and climate change for each socio-economic development pathway was an evolution from the previous SRES framework (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2000">IPCC, 2000</a>), in which socio-economic and emissions futures were closely aligned.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The new set of scenarios (SSP1-1.9 to SSP5-8.5) now features a higher top level of CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> emissions (SSP5-8.5 compared to RCP8.5), although the most significant change is again the addition of a very low climate change mitigation scenario (SSP1-1.9, compared to the previous low scenario, RCP2.6). Also, historically, none of the previous scenario sets featured a scenario that involves a very pronounced peak-and-decline emissions trajectory, but SSP1-1.9 does so now. The full set of nine SSP scenarios now includes a high-aerosol-emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0). The RCPs featured more uniformly low aerosol trajectories across all scenarios (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 2). More generally, the SSP scenarios feature a later peak of global emissions for the lower scenarios, simply as a consequence of historical emissions not having followed the trajectory projected by previous low scenarios (Figure 1.28).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Over the last decades, discussions around scenarios have often focussed on whether recent trends make certain future scenarios more or less probable or whether all scenarios are too high or too low. When the SRES scenarios first appeared, the debate was often whether the scenarios were overestimating actual world emissions developments (e.g., Castles and Henderson, 2003). With the strong emissions increase throughout the 2000s, that debate then shifted towards the question of whether the lower future climate change mitigation scenarios were rendered unfeasible (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pielke--2008">Pielke et al., 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Vuuren--2008">van Vuuren and Riahi, 2008</a>). Historical emissions between 2000 and 2010 approximately track the upper half of SRES and RCP projections (Figure 1.28). More generally, the global fossil fuel and industrial CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> emissions of recent decades tracked approximately the middle of the projected scenario ranges (Figure 1.28), although with regional differences (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pedersen--2020">Pedersen et al., 2020</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="1.6.1.4"><h3 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">1.6.1.4 The Likelihood of Reference Scenarios, Scenario Uncertainty and Storylines<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-44-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">In general, no likelihood is attached to the scenarios assessed in this Report. The use of different scenarios for climate change projections allows the exploration of ‘scenario uncertainty’ (<a class="section-link" data-title="Considering an Uncertain Future" href="#1.4.4">Section 1.4.4</a>; SR1.5; <a class="reference-link" href="#Collins--2013">Collins et al., 2013</a>). Scenario uncertainty is fundamentally different from geophysical uncertainties, which result from limitations in the understanding and predictability of the climate system (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smith--2011">Smith and Stern, 2011</a>). In scenarios, by contrast, future emissions depend to a large extent on the collective outcome of choices and processes related to population dynamics and economic activity, or on choices that affect a given activity’s energy and emissions intensity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2000">Jones, 2000</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Knutti--2008">Knutti et al., 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kriegler--2012">Kriegler et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Vuuren--2014">van Vuuren et al., 2014</a>). Even if identical socio-economic futures are assumed, the associated future emissions still face uncertainties, since different experts and model frameworks diverge in their estimates of future emissions ranges (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ho--2019">Ho et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">When exploring various climate futures, scenarios with no, or no additional, climate policies are often referred to as ‘baseline’ or ‘reference scenarios’ (<a class="section-link" data-title="Shared Socio-economic Pathways" href="#1.6.1.1">Section 1.6.1.1</a> and Glossary). Among the five core scenarios used most in this report, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 are explicit ‘no-climate-policy’ scenarios (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Table 1; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gidden--2019">Gidden et al., 2019</a>), assuming a carbon price of zero. These future ‘baseline’ scenarios are hence counterfactuals that include fewer climate policies compared to ‘business-as-usual’ scenarios – given that ‘business-as-usual’ scenarios could be understood to imply a continuation of existing climate policies. Generally, future scenarios are meant to cover a broad range of plausible futures, due, for example to unforeseen discontinuities in development pathways (<a class="reference-link" href="#Raskin--2020">Raskin and Swart, 2020</a>), or to large uncertainties in underlying long-term projections of economic drivers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Christensen--2018">Christensen et al., 2018</a>). However, the likelihood of high-emissions scenarios such as RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5 is considered low in light of recent developments in the energy sector (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hausfather--2020a">Hausfather and Peters, 2020a</a>, b). Studies that consider possible future emissions trends in the absence of additional climate policies, such as the recent IEA 2020 World Energy Outlook ‘stated policy’ scenario (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2020">IEA, 2020</a>), project approximately constant fossil fuel and industrial CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> emissions out to 2070, approximately in line with the intermediate RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hausfather--2020b">Hausfather and Peters, 2020b</a>) and the 2030 global emissions levels that are pledged as part of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement (<a class="section-link" data-title="The Policy and Governance Context" href="#1.2.2">Section 1.2.2</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fawcett--2015">Fawcett et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rogelj--2016">Rogelj et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2016">UNFCCC, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC, 2018</a>). On the other hand, the default concentrations aligned with RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5 and resulting climate futures derived by ESMs could be reached by lower emissions trajectories than RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5. That is because the uncertainty range on carbon cycle feedbacks includes stronger feedbacks than assumed in the default derivation of RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5 concentrations (Section 5.4; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ciais--2013">Ciais et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Friedlingstein--2014">Friedlingstein et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Booth--2017">Booth et al., 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">To address long-term scenario uncertainties, scenario storylines (or ‘narratives’) are often used (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Considering an Uncertain Future" href="#1.4.4">Section 1.4.4</a> for a more general discussion on ‘storylines’, also covering ‘physical climate storylines’; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rounsevell--2010">Rounsevell and Metzger, 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2014">O’Neill et al., 2014</a>).

Scenario storylines attempt to ‘stimulate, provoke, and communicate visions of what the future could hold for us’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rounsevell--2010">Rounsevell and Metzger, 2010</a>) in settings where either limited knowledge or inherent unpredictability in social systems prevent a forecast or numerical prediction. Scenario storylines have been used in previous climate research, and they are the explicit or implicit starting point of any scenario exercise, including for the SRES scenarios (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2000">IPCC, 2000</a>) and the SSPs (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2017a">O’Neill et al., 2017a</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Recent technological or socio-economic trends might be informative for bounding near-term future trends, for example, if technological progress renders a mitigation technology cheaper than previously assumed. However, short-term emissions trends alone do not generally rule out an opposite trend in the future (<a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Vuuren--2010">van Vuuren et al., 2010</a>). The ranking of individual RCP emissions scenarios from the IAMs with regard to emissions levels is different for different time horizons, for example, 2020 compared with longer-term emissions levels. For example, the strongest climate change mitigation scenario, RCP2.6, was in fact the second highest CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> emissions scenario (jointly with RCP4.5) before 2020 in the set of RCPs and the strong global emissions decline in RCP2.6 only followed after 2020. Implicitly, this scenario feature was cautioning against the assumption that short-term trends predicate particular long-term trajectories. This is also the case in relation to the COVID-19 related drop in 2020 emissions. Potential changes in underlying drivers of emissions, such as those potentially incentivized by COVID-19 recovery stimulus packages, are more significant for longer-term emissions than the short-term deviation from recent emissions trends (Cross-Chapter Box 6.1 on COVID-19).</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="cross-chapter-box-1.4"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-heading"><span class="•-Bold-condensed"> Cross-Chapter Box 1.4 | The SSP Scenarios as Used in Workin</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed">g Group I (WGI) </span><span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-33-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body"><span class="•-Bold-condensed">Contributing Authors: </span>Jan S.

They allow for a more comprehensive assessment of climate drivers and responses than has previously been available, in particular because some of the scenarios’ time series, (e.g., pollutants, emissions or changes in land use and land cover), are more diverse in the SSP scenarios than in the RCPs used in AR5 (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 2; e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Chuwah--2013">Chuwah et al., 2013</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body ParaOverride-4">The core set of five illustrative SSP scenarios – SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 – was selected in this Report to align with the objective that the new generation of SSP scenarios should fill certain gaps identified in the RCPs. For example, a scenario assuming reduced air-pollution control and thus higher aerosol emissions was missing from the RCPs. Likewise, nominally the only ‘no-additional-climate-policy’ scenario in the set of RCPs was RCP8.5. The new SSP3-7.0 ‘no-additional-climate-policy’ scenario fills both these gaps. A very strong mitigation scenario in line with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement was also missing from the RCPs, and the SSP1-1.9 scenario now fills this gap, complementing the other strong mitigation scenario SSP1-2.6. The five core SSPs were also chosen to ensure some overlap with the RCP levels for radiative forcing at the year 2100 (specifically 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5; <a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2016">O’Neill et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tebaldi--2021">Tebaldi et al., 2021</a>), although effective radiative forcings are generally higher in the SSP scenarios compared to the equivalently named RCP pathways (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Goals" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4#4.6.2">Section 4.6.2</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 1). In theory, running scenarios with similar radiative forcings would permit analysis of the CMIP5 and CMIP6 outcomes for pairs of scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5) in terms of varying model characteristics rather than differences in the underlying scenarios. In practice, however, there are limitations to this approach (Sections 1.6.1.1 and 4.6.2).</p><div class id="_idContainer073"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-Figure-title"><strong class="IPCC_•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-37" id="ccbox-1-4-figure-2" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_CCBox_1_4_Figure_1.png"></span></strong></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-Figure-title"><strong class="IPCC_•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 1 | </span></strong><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">The SSP scenarios used in this Report, their indicative temperature evolution and radiative forcing categorization, and the five socio-economic storylines upon which they are built. </span> The core set of scenarios used in this report – i.e., SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 – is shown together with an additional four SSPs that are part of ScenarioMIP, as well as previous RCP scenarios.

Inferring concentration changes from emissions time series requires using carbon cycle and other gas cycle models. To aid comparability across ESMs, and in order to allow participation of ESMs that do not have coupled carbon and other gas cycle models in CMIP6, most of the CMIP6 ESM experiments are so-called ‘concentration-driven’ runs, with concentrations of CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub>, CH<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">4</sub>, N<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub>O and other well-mixed GHGs prescribed in conjunction with aerosol emissions, ozone changes and effects from human-induced land-cover changes that may be radiatively active via albedo changes (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 2). In these concentration-driven climate projections, the uncertainty in projected future climate change resulting from our limited understanding of how the carbon cycle and other gas cycles will evolve in the future is not captured. For example, when deriving the default concentrations for these scenarios, permafrost and other carbon cycle feedbacks are considered using default settings, with a single time series prescribed for all ESMs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Meinshausen--2020">Meinshausen et al., 2020</a>).

In these experiments, atmospheric CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> concentrations are calculated internally using the ESM interactive carbon cycle module and thus differ from the prescribed default CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> concentrations used in the concentration-driven runs. In the particular case of SSP5-8.5, the emissions-driven runs are assessed to add no significant additional uncertainty to future global surface air temperature (GSAT) projections (<a class="section-link" data-title="Atmosphere" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4#4.3.1">Section 4.3.1</a>).

First, global warming levels relative to pre-industrial conditions are the quantity in which the 1.5°C and ‘well below 2°C’ Paris Agreement goals were formulated. Second, global mean temperature change has been found to be almost-linearly related to a number of regional climate effects (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mitchell--2000">Mitchell et al., 2000</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mitchell--2003">Mitchell, 2003</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tebaldi--2014">Tebaldi and Arblaster, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2016">Seneviratne et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2020">Li et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2020">Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020</a>).

Finally, the evolution of aggregated impacts with warming levels has been widely used and embedded in the assessment of the ‘Reasons for Concern’ (RFC) in IPCC WGII (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smith--2009">Smith et al., 2009</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>). The RFC framework was further expanded in SR1.5 (2018), SROCC (2019) and SRCCL (2019) by explicitly describing the differential impacts of half-degree warming steps (<a class="section-link" data-title="Considering an Uncertain Future" href="#1.4.4">Section 1.4.4</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 12.1; cf. <a class="reference-link" href="#King--2017">King et al., 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">In this Report, the term ‘global warming level’ refers to the categorization of global and regional climate change, associated impacts, emissions and concentrations scenarios by GMST relative to 1850–1900, which is the period used as a proxy for pre-industrial levels (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1). By default, GWLs are expressed in terms of global surface air temperature (GSAT; <a class="section-link" data-title="Baselines, Reference Periods and Anomalies" href="#1.4.1">Section 1.4.1</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 2.3).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">As SR1.5 concluded, even half-degree global mean temperature steps carry robust differences in climate impacts (Chapter 11; SR1.5, <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schleussner--2016a">Schleussner et al., 2016a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wartenburger--2017">Wartenburger et al., 2017</a>). This Report adopts half-degree warming levels, which allows integration for climate projections, impacts, adaptation challenges and mitigation challenges within and across the three WGs. The core set of GWLs – 1.5°C, 2.0°C, 3.0°C and 4.0°C – are highlighted (Chapters 4, 8, 11, 12 and Atlas). Given that much impact analysis is based on previous scenarios, (i.e., RCPs or SRES), and climate change mitigation analysis is based on new emissions scenarios in addition to the main SSP scenarios, these GWLs assist in the comparison of climate states across scenarios and in the synthesis across the broader literature.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">The transient and equilibrium states of certain global warming levels can differ in their climate impacts (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#King--2020">King et al., 2020</a>). Climate impacts in a ‘transient’ world relate to a scenario in which the world is continuing to warm. On the other hand, climate impacts at the same warming levels can also be estimated from equilibrium states after a (relatively) short-term stabilization by the end of the21st century or at a (near-)equilibrium state after a long-term (multi-decadal to multi-millennial) stabilization. Different methods to estimate these climate states come with challenges and limitations (<a class="section-link" data-title="Implications of Climate Policy" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4#4.6.1">Section 4.6.1</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 11.1). <span class="•-Bold-condensed"></span>First, information can be drawn from GCM or ESM simulations that ‘pass through’ the respective warming levels (as used and demonstrated in the Interactive Atlas), also called ‘epoch’ or ‘time-shift’ approaches (Sections 4.2.4 and 4.6.1; <a class="reference-link" href="#Herger--2015">Herger et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#James--2017">James et al., 2017</a>; Tebaldi and <a class="reference-link" href="#Knutti--2018">Knutti, 2018</a>). Information from transient simulations can also be used through an empirical scaling relationship (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2016">Seneviratne et al., 2016</a>, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wartenburger--2017">Wartenburger et al., 2017</a>) or using ‘time sampling’ approaches, as described in <a class="reference-link" href="#James--2017">James et al. (2017)</a>. Second, information can be drawn from large ESM ensembles with prescribed SST at particular global warming levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mitchell--2017">Mitchell et al., 2017</a>), although an underrepresentation of variability can arise when using prescribed SST temperatures (E.M. <a class="reference-link" href="#Fischer--2018"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Fischer--2018">Fischer et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">In order to fully derive climate impacts, warming levels will need to be complemented by additional information, such as their associated CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> concentrations (e.g., fertilization or ocean acidification), composition of the total radiative forcing (aerosols compared with GHGs, with varying regional distributions) or socio-economic conditions (e.g., to estimate societal impacts). More fundamentally, while a global warming level is a good proxy for the state of the climate (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1), it does not uniquely define a change in global or regional climate state. For example, regional precipitation responses depend on the details of the individual forcing mechanisms that caused the change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Samset--2016">Samset et al., 2016</a>); on whether the temperature level is stabilized or transient (<a class="reference-link" href="#King--2020">King et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zappa--2020">Zappa et al., 2020</a>); on the vertical structure of the troposphere (<a class="reference-link" href="#Andrews--2010">Andrews et al., 2010</a>); and, in particular, on the global distribution of atmospheric aerosols (<a class="reference-link" href="#Frieler--2012">Frieler et al., 2012</a>). Another aspect is how Earth system components with century-to-millennial response time scales, such as long-term sea level rise or permafrost thaw, are affected by global mean warming. For example, sea level rise 50 years after a 1°C warming will be lower than sea level rise 150 years after that same 1°C warming (Chapter 9).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-">Also, forcing or response patterns that vary in time can create differences in regional climates for the same global mean warming level, or can create non-linearities when scaling patterns from one warming level to another (<a class="reference-link" href="#King--2018">King et al., 2018</a>), depending on whether near-term transient climate, end of the century, equilibrium climate or climate states after an initial overshoot are considered.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1">In spite of these challenges, and thanks to recent methodological advances in quantifying or overcoming them, global warming levels provide a robust and useful integration mechanism. They allow knowledge from various domains within WGI and across the three WGs to be integrated and communicated (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1). In this report, Chapters 4, 8, 11, 12 and the <a class="section-link" data-title="Atlas" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/atlas">Atlas</a> provide information specific to certain warming levels, highlighting the regional differences, but also the approximate scalability of regional climate change, that can arise from even a 0.5°C shift in global mean temperatures.

This Report thus uses cumulative CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> emissions to compare the climate response across scenarios, and to categorize emissions scenarios (Figure 1.29). The advantage of using cumulative CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> emissions is that it is an inherent emissions scenario characteristic rather than an outcome of the scenario-based projections, where uncertainties in the cause–effect chain – from emissions to atmospheric concentrations to temperature change – are important.</p><div class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" id="_idContainer079"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-38" id="figure-1-29" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_1_29.png"></span></span></strong><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Figure 1.29 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">The role of CO2 in driving future climate change in comparison to other greenhouse gases (GHGs)</span>.

The dominance of CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> compared to other well-mixed GHGs (Figure 1.29 and Section 5.2.4) allows policymakers to make use of the carbon budget concept (Section 5.5) in a policy context, in which GWP-weighted combinations of multiple GHGs are used to define emissions targets. A caveat is that cumulative GWP-weighted CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> equivalent emissions over the next decades do not yield exactly the same temperature outcomes as the same amount of cumulative CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> emissions, because atmospheric perturbation lifetimes of the various GHGs differ. While carbon budgets are not derived using GWP-weighted emissions baskets but rather by explicit modelling of non-CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> -induced warming (Section 5.5 and Cross-Chapter Box 7.1), the policy frameworks based on GWP-weighted emissions baskets can still make use of the insights from remaining cumulative carbon emissions for different warming levels.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1">Thesame cumulative CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> emissions could lead to a slightly different level of warming over time (Box 1.4).

As further explored in the WGIII assessment, one potential limitation when presenting emissions pathway characteristics in cumulative emissions budget categories is that path dependencies and lock-in effects (e.g. today’s decisions regarding fossil fuel-related infrastructure) play an important role in long-term mitigation strategies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Davis--2010">Davis et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Luderer--2018">Luderer et al., 2018</a>).

Similarly, ‘net zero GHG emissions’ is the condition in which metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions are balanced by metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG removals over a specified period. The quantification of net zero GHG emissions thus depends on the GHG emissions metric chosen to compare emissions of different gases, as well as the time horizon chosen for that metric.

The effect of net zero GHG emissions on global surface temperature depends on the GHG emissions metric chosen to aggregate emissions and removals of different gases. For GWP100 (the metric in which Parties to the Paris Agreement have decided to report their aggregated emissions and removals), net zero GHG emissions would generally imply a peak in global surface temperature, followed by a gradual decline (Section 7.6.2; see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Change Beyond 2100" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.1">Section 4.7.1</a> regarding the zero emissions commitment).

The first IPCC report, released in 1990, concluded that human-caused climate change would soon become evident, but could not yet confirm that it was already happening. Today, evidence is overwhelming that the climate has indeed changed since the pre-industrial era and that human activities are the principal cause of that change. With much more data and better models, we also understand more about how the atmosphere interacts with the ocean, ice, snow, ecosystems and land surfaces of the Earth. Computer climate simulations have also improved dramatically, incorporating many more natural processes and providing projections at much high</i><i class="•-Regular-Italic">er resolutions. </i></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Since the first IPCC report in 1990, large numbers of new instruments have been deployed to collect data in the air, on land, at sea and from outer space. These instruments measure temperature, clouds, winds, ice, snow, ocean currents, sea level, soot and dust in the air, and many other aspects of the climate system. New satellite instruments have also provided a wealth of increasingly fine-grained data. Additional data from older observing systems and even hand-written historical records are still being incorporated into observational datasets, and these datasets are now better integrated and adjusted for historical changes in instruments and measurement techniques. Ice cores, sediments, fossils, and other new evidence from the distant past have taught us much about how Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB">Understanding of climate system processes has also improved. For example, in 1990 very little was known about how the deep ocean responds to climate change. Today, reconstructions of deep-ocean temperatures extend as far back as 1871. We now know that the oceans absorb most of the excess energy trapped</span>by greenhouse gases and <span lang="en-GB">that even the deep ocean is warming up. As another example, in 1990, relatively little was known about exactly how or when the gigantic ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica would respond to warming. Today, much more data and better models of ice-sheet behaviour reveal unexpectedly high melt rates that will lead to major changes within this century, including substantial sea level </span><span lang="en-GB">rise (FAQ 9.2). </span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">The major natural factors contributing to climate change on time scales of decades to centuries are volcanic eruptions and variations in the sun’s energy output. Today, data show that changes in incoming solar energy since 1900 have contributed only slightly to global warming, and they exhibit a slight downward trend since the 1970s. Data also show that major volcanic eruptions have sometimes cooled the entire planet for relatively short periods of time (typically several years) by erupting aerosols (tiny airborne particles) high into the atmosphere.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-GB">The main human causes of climate change are the heat-</span>absorbing greenhouse gases released<span lang="en-GB">by fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and agriculture, which warm the planet; and aerosols such as sulphate from burning coal, which have a short-term cooling effect that partially counteracts human-caused warming. Since 1990, we have more and better observations of these human factors as well as improved historical records, resulting in more precise estimates of human influence on the climate sy</span><span lang="en-GB">stem (FAQ 3.1). </span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">While most climate models in 1990 focused on the atmosphere, using highly simplified representations of oceans and land surfaces, today’s Earth system simulations include detailed models of oceans, ice, snow, vegetation and many other variables. An important test of models is their ability to simulate Earth’s climate over the period of instrumental records (since about 1850). Several rounds of such testing have taken place since 1990, and the testing itself has become much more rigorous and extensive. As a group and at large scales, models have predicted the observed changes well in these tests (FAQ 3.3). Since there is no way to do a controlled laboratory experiment on the actual Earth, climate model simulations can also provide a kind of ‘alternate Earth’ to test what would have happened without human influence. Such experiments show that the observed warming would not have occurred without human influence.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">Finally, physical theory predicts that human influence on the climate system should produce specific patterns of change, and we see those patterns in both observations and climate simulations. For example, nights are warming faster than days, less heat is escaping to space, and the lower atmosphere (troposphere) is warming but the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) has cooled. These confirmed predictions are all evidence of changes driven primarily by increases in GHG concentrations rather than natural causes.</p><p class="•-Graphic-insert" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-7" id="faq-1-1-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_1_1_Figure_1.png"></span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 1.1, Figure 1 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Sample elements of climate understanding, observations and models as assessed in the IPCC First Assessment Report (1990) and Sixth Assessment Report (2021). </span>Many other advances since 1990, such as key aspects of theoretical understanding, geological records and attribution of change to human influence, are not included in this figure because they are not readily represented in this simple format.

The high northern latitudes show the largest temperature increase, with clear effects on sea ice and glaciers. The warming in the tropical regions is also apparent because the natural year-to-year variations in temperature there are small. Long-term changes in other variables such as rainfall and some weather and climate extremes have also now become apparent i</i><i class="•-Regular-Italic">n many regions. </i></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">It was first noticed that the planet’s land areas were warming in the 1930s. Although increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub>) concentrations were suggested as part of the explanation, it was not certain at the time whether the observed warming was part of a long-term trend or a natural fluctuation: global warming had not yet become apparent. But the planet continued to warm, and by the 1980s the changes in temperature had become obvious or, in other words, the <i class="•-Regular-Italic">sign</i><i class="•-Regular-Italic">al</i>had <i class="•-Regular-Italic">emerged</i>.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Imagine you had been monitoring temperatures at the same location for the past 150 years. What would you have experienced? When would the warming have become noticeable in your data? The answers to these questions depend on where on the planet you are.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Observations and climate model simulations both demonstrate that the largest long-term warming trends are in the high northern latitudes and the smallest warming trends over land are in tropical regions. However, the year-to-year variations in temperature are smallest in the tropics, meaning that the changes there are also apparent, relative to the range of past experiences (FAQ 1.2, Figure 1).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Changes in temperature also tend to be more apparent over land areas than over the open ocean and are often most apparent in regions which are more vulnerable to climate change. It is expected that future changes will continue to show the largest signals at high northern latitudes, but with the most apparent warming in the tropics. The tropics also stand to benefit the most from climate change mitigation in this context, as limiting global warming will also limit how far the climate shifts relative to past experience.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Changes in other climate variables have also become apparent at smaller spatial scales. For example, changes in average rainfall are becoming clear in some regions, but not in others, mainly because natural year-to-year variations in precipitation tend to be large relative to the magnitude of the long-term trends. However, extreme rainfall is becoming more intense in many regions, potentially increasing the impacts from inland flooding (FAQ 8.2). Sea levels are also clearly rising on many coastlines, increasing the impacts of inundation from coastal storm surges, even without any increase in the number of storms reaching land. A decline in the amount of Arctic sea ice is apparent, both in the area covered and in its thickness, with implications for polar ecosystems.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">When considering climate-related impacts, it is not necessarily the size of the change that is most important. Instead, it can be the rate of change or it can also be the size of the change relative to the natural variations of the climate to which ecosystems and society are adapted. As the climate is pushed further away from past experiences and enters an unprecedented state, the impacts can become larger, along with the challenge of adapting to them.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">How and when a long-term trend becomes distinguishable from shorter-term natural variations depends on the aspect of climate being considered (e.g., temperature, rainfall, sea ice or sea level), the region being considered, the rate of change, and the magnitude and timing of natural variations. When assessing the local impacts from climate change, both the size of the change and the amplitude of natural variations matter.</p><p class="•-Graphic-insert" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-8" id="faq-1-2-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_1_2_Figure_1.png"></span></span> </p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 1.2, Figure 1</span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title">| </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Observed variations in regional temperatures since 1850</span>(data from Berkeley Earth).

Studying these past warm periods informs us about the potential long-term consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in</i><i class="•-Regular-Italic">the atmosphere. </i></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Rising greenhouse gas concentrations are driving profound changes to the Earth system, including global warming, sea level rise, increases in climate and weather extremes, ocean acidification, and ecological shifts (FAQ 2.2 and FAQ 7.1). The vast majority of instrumental observations of climate began during the 20th century, when greenhouse gas emissions from human activities became the dominant driver of changes in Earth’s climate (FAQ 3.1).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">As scientists seek to refine our understanding of Earth’s climate system and how it may evolve in coming decades to centuries, past climate states provide a wealth of insights. Data about these past states help to establish the relationship between natural climate drivers and the history of changes in global temperature, global sea levels, the carbon cycle, ocean circulation, and regional climate patterns, including climate extremes. Guided by such data, scientists use Earth system models to identify the chain of events underlying the transitions between past climatic states (FAQ 3.3). This is important because during present-day climate change, just as in past climate changes, some aspects of the Earth system (e.g., surface temperature) respond to changes in greenhouse gases on a time scale of decades to centuries, while others (e.g., sea level and the carbon cycle) respond over centuries to millennia (FAQ 5.3). In this way, past climate states serve as critical benchmarks for climate model simulations, improving our understanding of the sequences, rates, and magnitude of future climate change over the next decades to millennia.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Analyzing previous warm periods caused by natural factors can help us understand how key aspects of the climate system evolve in response to warming. For example, one previous warm-climate state occurred roughly 125,000 years ago, during the Last Interglacial period, when slight variations in the Earth’s orbit triggered a sequence of changes that caused about 1°C–2°C of global warming and about 2–8 m of sea level rise relative to the 1850–1900, even though atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to 1850–1900 values (FAQ 1.3, Figure 1). Modelling studies highlight that increased summer heating in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during this time caused widespread melting of snow and ice, reducing the reflectivity of the planet and increasing the absorption of solar energy by the Earth’s surface. This gave rise to global-scale warming, which led in turn to further ice loss and sea level rise. These self-reinforcing positive <i class="•-Regular-Italic">feedback</i><i class="•-Condensed-italic">cycles</i>are a pervasive feature of Earth’s climate system, with clear implications for future climate change under continued greenhouse gas emissions. In the case of sea level rise, these cycles evolved over several centuries to millennia, reminding us that the rates and magnitude of sea level rise in the 21st century are just a fraction of the sea level rise that will ultimately occur after the Earth system fully adjusts to current levels of global warming.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Roughly 3 million years ago, during the Pliocene Epoch, the Earth witnessed a prolonged period of elevated temperatures (2.5°C–4°C higher than 1850–1900) and higher sea levels (5–25 m higher than 1850–1900), in combination with atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations similar to those of the present day. The fact that Pliocene atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to the present, while global temperatures and sea levels were significantly higher, reflects the difference between an Earth system that has fully adjusted to changes in natural drivers (the Pliocene) and one where greenhouse gases concentrations, temperature, and sea level rise are still increasing (present day). Much about the transition into the Pliocene climate state – in terms of key causes, the role of cycles that hastened or slowed the transition, and the rate of change in climate indicators such as sea level – remain topics of intense study by climate researchers, using a combination of paleoclimate observations and Earth system models. Insights from such studies may help to reduce the large uncertainties around estimates of global sea level rise by 2300, which range from 0.3 m to 3 m above 1850–1900 (in a low-emissions scenario) to as much as 16 m higher than 1850–1900 (in a very high-emissions scenario that includes accelerating structural disintegration of the polar ice sheets).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">While present-day warming is unusual in the context of the recent geologic past in several different ways (FAQ 2.1), past warm climate states present a stark reminder that the long-term adjustment to present-day atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations has only just begun.
