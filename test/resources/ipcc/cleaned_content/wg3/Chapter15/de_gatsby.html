For these countries the costs and risks of financing often represent a significant challenge for stakeholders at all levels. This challenge is exacerbated by these countries’ general economic vulnerability and indebtedness. The rising public fiscal costs of mitigation, and of adapting to climate shocks, are affecting many countries and worsening public indebtedness and country credit ratings at a time when there were already significant stresses on public finances. The COVID-19 pandemic has made these stresses worse and tightened public finances still further. Other major challenges for commercial climate finance include: the mismatch between capital and investment needs, <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- CharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="ch15.html#footnote-016">1</a> </span></span> home bias <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="ch15.html#footnote-015">2</a> </span></span> considerations, differences in risk perceptions for regions, as well as limited institutional capacity to ensure safeguards represent. <!-- -->{15.2, 15.6.3}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Investors, central banks, and financial regulators are driving increased awareness of climate risk.

Awareness of these risks is increasing leading also to concerns about financial stability. Financial regulators and institutions have responded with multiple regulatory and voluntary initiatives by to assess and address these risks. Yet despite these initiatives, climate-related financial risks remain greatly underestimated by financial institutions and markets limiting the capital reallocation needed for the low-carbon transition. Moreover, risks relating to national and international inequity – which act as a barrier to the transformation – are not yet reflected in decisions by the financial community. Stronger steering by regulators and policy makers has the potential to close this gap. Despite the increasing attention of investors to climate change, there is limited evidence that this attention has directly impacted emission reductions.

Underpinning this evolution is investors’ preference for scalable and identifiable low-carbon investment opportunities. These relatively new labelled financial products will help by allowing a smooth integration into existing asset allocation models (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>). Markets for green bonds, ESG (environmental, social, and governance), and sustainable finance products have also increased significantly since AR5, but challenges nevertheless remain, in particular there are concerns about ‘greenwashing’ and the limited application of these markets to developing countries. New business models (e.g., pay-as-you-go) can facilitate the aggregation of small-scale financing needs and provide scalable investment opportunities with more attractive risk-return profiles. Support and guidance for enhancing transparency can promote capital markets’ climate financing by providing quality information to price climate risks and opportunities. Examples include Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure, scenario analysis and climate risk assessments, including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The outcome of these market-correcting approaches on capital flows cannot be taken for granted, however, without appropriate fiscal, monetary and financial policies. Mitigation policies will be required to enhance the risk-weighted return of low-emission and climate-resilient options, and – supported by progress in transparent and scientifically based projects’ assessment methods – to accelerate the emergence and support for financial products based on real projects, such as green bonds, and phase out fossil fuel subsidies. Greater public-private cooperation can also encourage the private sector to increase and broaden investments, within a context of safeguards and standards, and this can be integrated into national climate change policies and plans. <!-- -->{15.1, 15.2.4, 15.3.1, 15.3.2, 15.3.3, 15.5.2, 15.6.1, 15.6.2, 15.6.6, 15.6.7, 15.6.8}<!-- -->.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">The following policy options can have important long-term catalytic benefits</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> (</span><span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">high confidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">) </span> <span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">. </span> (i) Stepped-up both the quantum and composition of financial, technical support and partnership in low-income and vulnerable countries alongside low-carbon energy access in low-income countries, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, which currently receives less than 5% of global climate financing flows; (ii) continued strong role of international and national financial institutions, including multilateral, especially location-based regional, and national development banks; (iii) de-risking cross-border investments in low-carbon infrastructure, development of local green bond markets, and the alignment of climate and non-climate policies, including direct and indirect supports on fossil fuels, consistent with the climate goals; (iv) lowering financing costs including transaction costs and addressing risks through funds and risk-sharing mechanisms for under-served groups; (v) accelerated finance for nature-based solutions, including mitigation in the forest sector (REDD+), and climate-responsive social protection; (vi) improved financing instruments for loss and damage events, including risk-pooling-transfer-sharing for climate risk insurance; (vii) economic instruments, such as phasing in carbon pricing and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies in a way that addresses equity and access; and (viii) gender-responsive and women-empowered programmes. <!-- -->{15.2.3, 15.2.4, 15.3.1, 15.3.2.2, 15.3.3, 15.4.1, 15.4.2, 15.4.3, 15.5.2, 15.6, 15.6.2, 15.6.4, 15.6.5, 15.6.6, 15.6.7, 15.6.8.2}</p></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="15.1"><h1 class="Headings_•-H1---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">15.1</span>Climate Finance – Key Concepts and Scope </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-2-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Finance for climate action (or climate finance), environmental finance (which also covers other environmental priorities such as water, air pollution and biodiversity), and sustainable finance (which encompasses issues relating to socio-economic impacts, poverty alleviation and empowerment) are interrelated rather than mutually exclusive concepts (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP%20Inquiry--2016a">UNEP Inquiry 2016a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#ICMA--2020a">ICMA 2020a</a>). Their combination is needed to align mitigation investments with multiple SDGs, and at a minimum, minimise the conflicts between climate targets and SDGs not being targeted. From a climate policy perspective, climate finance refers to finance ‘whose expected effect is to reduce net GHG emissions and/or enhance resilience to the impacts of climate variability and projected climate change’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2018a">UNFCCC 2018a</a>). However, as pinpointed in the AR5, significant room for interpretation and context-specific considerations remains. Further, such definition needs to be put in perspective with the expectations of investors and financiers (see Box 15.2).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Specifying the scope of climate finance requires defining two terms: what qualifies as ‘finance’ and as ‘climate’ respectively. In terms of what type of finance to consider, options include considering investments or total costs (Box 15.1), stocks or flows, gross or net (the latter taking into account reflows and/or depreciation), and domestic or cross-border, public or private (Box 15.2). In terms of what may be considered as ‘climate’, a key difference relates to measuring climate-specific finance (only accounts for the portion of finance resulting in climate benefits) or climate-related finance (captures total project costs and aims to measure the mainstreaming of climate considerations). One should even consider the investments decided for reasons unrelated with climate objectives but which contribute to these objectives (hydroelectricity, rail transportation).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In many cases, the scope of what may be considered as ‘climate finance’ will also depend on the context of implementation such as priorities and activities listed in countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2019a">UNFCCC 2019a</a>) as well as national development plans more broadly targeting the achievement of SDGs. Hence, rather than opposing the different options listed above, the choice of one or the other depends on the desired scope of measurement, which in turn depends on the policy objective being pursued. The increasingly diverse initiatives and body of grey literature address a range of different information needs. They provide analyses at the levels of domestic finance flows (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#UNDP--2015">UNDP 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hainaut--2018">Hainaut and Cochran 2018</a>), international flows (e.g. <a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2016">OECD 2016</a>; AfDB et al. 2018), global flows (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2018a">UNFCCC 2018a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Buchner--2019">Buchner et al. 2019</a>), the financial system (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP%20Inquiry--2016a">UNEP Inquiry 2016a</a>) or specific financial instruments such as bonds (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#CBI--2018">CBI 2018</a>). Common frameworks, reporting transparency are, however, necessary in order to identify overlaps, commonalities and differences between these different measurements in terms of scope and underlying definitions. In that regard, the developments of national and international taxonomies, definitions and standards can help, as further discussed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Approaches to Accelerate Alignment of Financial Flows with Long-term Global Goals" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.6">Section 15.6</a>, and <a class="section-link" data-title="Accelerating the transition in the context of sustainable development" href="/chapters/chapter-17">Chapter 17</a> in AR6 WGII report.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Beyond the need to scale up levels of climate finance, the Paris Agreement provides a broad policy environment and momentum for a more systemic and transformational change in investment and financing strategies and patterns.

This formulation is a recognition that the mitigation and resilience goals cannot be achieved without finance, both in the real economy and in the financial system, being made consistent with these goals (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zamarioli--2021">Zamarioli et al. 2021</a>). It has in turn contributed to the development of the concept of alignment (with the Paris Agreement) used in the financial sector (banks, institutional investors), businesses, and public institutions (development banks, public budgets). As a result, since AR5, in addition to measuring and analysing climate finance, an increasing focus has been placed on assessing the consistency or alignment, as well as respectively the inconsistency or misalignment, of finance with climate policy objectives, as for instance illustrated by the multilateral development banks’ joint framework for aligning their activities with the goals of the Paris Agreements (<a class="reference-link" href="#MDBs--2018">MDBs 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Assessing climate consistency or alignment implies looking at all investment and financing activities, whether they target, contribute to, undermine or have no particular impact on climate objectives. This all-encompassing scope notably includes remaining investments and financing for high-GHG emission activities that may be incompatible with remaining carbon budgets, but also activities that may play a transition role in climate mitigation pathways and scenarios (<a class="section-link" data-title="Estimates of Climate Finance Flows" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.3.2">Section 15.3.2</a>.3). As a result, any meaningful assessment of progress requires the use of different shades to assess activities based on their negative, neutral (‘do no harm’) or positive contributions, (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#CICERO--2015">CICERO 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cochran--2019">Cochran and Pauthier 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Natixis--2019">Natixis 2019</a>). Doing so in practice requires the development of robust definitions, assessment methods and metrics, an area of work and research that remained under development at the time of writing. A range of financial sector coalitions and civil society organisations as well as commercial services providers to the financial industry have developed frameworks, approaches and metrics, mainly focusing on investment portfolios (Institut Louis Bachelier et al.. 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#IIGCC--2021">IIGCC 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#TCFD%20Portfolio%20Alignment%20Team--2021">TCFD Portfolio Alignment Team 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UN-Convened%20Net-Zero%20Asset%20Owner%20Alliance--2021">UN-Convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance 2021</a>), and, to a lesser extent for real economy investments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Micale--2020">Micale et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jachnik--2021">Jachnik and Dobrinevski 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Key findings from AR5 and other IPCC publications. </span>For the first time the IPCC in AR5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Clarke--2014">Clarke et al. 2014</a>) elaborated on the role of finance in a dedicated chapter. In the following year, the Paris Agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2015">UNFCCC 2015</a>) recognised the transformative role of finance, as a means to achieving climate outcomes, and the need to align financial flows with the long-term global goals even as implementation issues were left unresolved (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bodle--2018">Bodle and Noens 2018</a>). AR5 noted the absence of a clear definition and measurement of climate finance flows, a difficulty that continues (<a class="reference-link" href="#Weikmans--2019">Weikmans and Roberts 2019</a>) (Sections 15.2 and 15.3). The approach taken in AR5 was to report ranges of available information on climate finance flows from diverse sources, using a broad definition of climate finance, as in the Biennial Assessments in 2014 and again in 2018 (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2014a">UNFCCC 2014a</a>, 2018a) of the Standing Committee under the UNFCCC: Climate finance is taken to refer to local, national or transnational financing – drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing – that seeks to support mitigation and adaptation actions that address climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2014b">UNFCCC 2014b</a>). For this chapter, while the focus is primarily on mitigation, adaptation, resilience and loss and damage financing needs cannot be entirely separated because of structural relationships, synergies, trade-offs and policy coherence requirements between these sub-categories of climate finance (Box 15.1).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The AR5 concluded that published assessments of financial flows whose expected effect was to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and/or to enhance resilience to climate change aggregated USD343–385 billion <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="ch15.html#footnote-013">4</a> </span></span> yr <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1">–1</span> globally between 2010 and 2012 (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</span>).

As against these flows, annual need for global aggregate mitigation finance between 2020 and 2030 was cited briefly in the AR5 to be about USD635 billion (mean annual), both public and private, implying that the reported ‘gap’ in mitigation financing of estimated flows during 2010 to 2012 was slightly under one-half of that required (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014">IPCC 2014</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">More recent published data from the Biennial Assessments (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2018a">UNFCCC 2018a</a>) and the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC 2018</a>) have revised upwards the needs of financing between 2020 and 2030 to 2035 to contain global temperature rise to below 2°C and 1.5°C respectively by 2100: USD1.7 trillion yr <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1">–1</span> (mean) in the Biennial Assessment 2018 for the former, and for the latter, USD2.4 trillion yr <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1">–1</span> (mean) for the energy sector alone (and three times higher if transport and other sectors were to be included).

While the annual reported flows of climate financing showed some moderate progress (<a class="section-link" data-title="Assessment of Current Financial Flows" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.3">Section 15.3</a>), from earlier USD364 billion (mean 2010/2011) to about USD600 billion (mean 2017/2020), with a slowing in the most recent period 2014 to 2017, the gap in financing was reported to have widened considerably (Sections 15.4 and 15.5). In the context of policy coherence, it is also important to note that reported annual investments going into the fossil fuel sectors, oil and gas upstream and coal mining, during the same period were about the same size as global climate finance, although the absence of alternative financing and access to low-carbon energy is a complicating factor.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Adaptation financing needs, meanwhile, were rising rapidly. The Adaption Gap Report 2020 (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2021">UNEP 2021</a>) reported that the current efforts are insufficient to narrow the adaptation finance gap, and additional adaptation finance is necessary, particularly in developing countries. The gap is expected to be aggravated by COVID-19 (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>).

If mitigation investments are inadequate to reducing global warming (as in the last decade) with asymmetric adverse impacts in lower latitudes and low-lying geographies, the scale of adaptation investments has to rise and the benefits of stronger adaptation responses may be high (<a class="reference-link" href="#Markandya--2019">Markandya and González-Eguino 2019</a>). If adaptation investments build greater resilience, they might even moderate mitigation financing costs. Similar policy coherence considerations apply to disaster risk reduction financing, the scale of which depends on success with both adaptation and mitigation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mysiak--2018">Mysiak et al. 2018</a>). The same financial actors, especially governments and the private sector, decide at any given time on their relative allocations of available financing for mitigation, adaptation and disaster-risk reduction from a constrained common pool of resources. The trade-offs and substitutability between closely-linked alternative uses of funds, therefore, make it essential for a simultaneous assessment of needs – as in parts of this chapter. Climate finance versus the financing of other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) faces a similar issue. A key agreement was that climate financing should be ‘new and additional’ and not at the cost of SDGs. Resources prioritising climate at the cost of non-climate development finance increase the vulnerability of a population for any given level of climate shocks, and additionality of climate financing is thus essential (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brown--2010">Brown et al. 2010</a>). Policy coherence is also the reason why mitigation finance cannot be separated from consideration of spending and subsidies on fossil fuels. Climate change may additionally cause the breaching of physical and social adaptation limits, resulting in climate-related residual risks (i.e., potential impacts after all feasible mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction measures have been implemented) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mechler--2020">Mechler et al. 2020</a>). Because these residual losses and damages from climate-related risks are related to overall mitigation and adaptation efforts, the magnitude of potential impacts is related to the overall quantum of mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction finance available (<a class="reference-link" href="#Frame--2020">Frame et al. 2020</a>).

The issue of climate finance is closely related to the conversation on international cooperation and the question of how cross-border investments can support climate mitigation and adaptation in developing countries. However, the issue is also related to more general questions of how financial institutions, both public and private, can assess climate risks and opportunities from all investments, and what roles states, policymakers, regulators and markets can play in making them more sustainable. In particular, the question of the respective roles of the public and private financial actors has become important in deliberations on climate finance in recent years.

Since then, the financial sector has recognised the opportunity and has stepped up to centre-stage in the global policy conversation on climate change. While before the Paris Agreement, only few financial professionals and regulators were acquainted with climate change, today climate change is acknowledged as a strategic priority in most financial institutions. This is a major change in the policy landscape from AR5. However, this does not mean that finance necessarily plays an adequate enabling role for climate investments. On the contrary, the literature shows that without appropriate conditions, finance can represent a barrier to filling the climate investment gap (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hafner--2020">Hafner et al. 2020</a>). Indeed, despite the enormous acceleration in policy initiatives (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#NGFS--2020">NGFS 2020</a>) and coalitions of the willing in the private sectors, the effect in terms of closing the investment gap identified already in AR5 has been limited (<a class="section-link" data-title="Identified Financing Gaps for Sector and Regions" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.5.2">Section 15.5.2</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Financial investors have started to account for climate risk in some contexts but they do so only to a limited extent (<a class="reference-link" href="#Monasterolo--2020">Monasterolo and de Angelis 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Alessi--2021">Alessi et al. 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bolton--2021">Bolton and Kacperczyk 2021</a>) and the reasons for these remain unclear. Two aspects are relevant here. The first is the endogenous nature of climate financial risk and opportunities (with the term ‘risk’ meaning here the potential for adverse financial impact, whether or not the distribution of losses is known). Academics and practitioners in finance are aware that financial risk can in certain contexts be endogenous, that is, the materialisation of losses is affected by the action of financial players themselves. However, the standard treatment of risk both in financial valuation models and in asset pricing assumes that risk is exogenous. In contrast, endogeneity is a key feature of climate risk because today’s perception of climate risk affects climate investment, which in turn affects directly the future risk. This endogeneity leads to the fact that multiple and rather different mitigation scenarios are possible (Chapter 3). Moreover, the likelihood of occurrence of each alternative scenario is very hard to estimate. Further, the assessment of climate-related financial risk requires to combine information related to mitigation scenarios as well as climate impact scenarios, leaving open an important knowledge gap for the next years (<a class="section-link" data-title="Addressing Knowledge Gaps with Regard to Climate Risk Analysis and Transparency" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.6.1">Section 15.6.1</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The second aspect is that the multiplicity of equilibria results in a coordination problem whereby the majority of investors wait to move and reallocate their investments until they can follow a clear signal.

By <span class="•-Condensed-italic">near-term</span>, we mean here the likely cycle over the next five to ten years (2020–2025 and 2020–2030), as influenced by global macroeconomic real business cycles (output, investment and consumption), with periodic asymmetric downside impacts and crises (Gertlerand Kiyotaki 2010; <a class="reference-link" href="#Borio--2014">Borio 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jord%C3%A0--2017">Jordà et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Borio--2018">Borio et al. 2018</a>). Financial cycles typically have strong co-movements (asset prices, credit growth, interest rates, leverage, risk factors, market fear, macro-prudential and central bank policies) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Coeurdacier--2013">Coeurdacier and Rey 2013</a>), they have large consequences for all types of financial flows such as equity, bond and banking credit markets, which in turn are likely to impact climate finance flows to all sub-sectors and geographies (with greater expected volatility in more risky and more leveraged regions). This is in contrast to <span class="•-Condensed-italic">longer-term trend considerations</span> (2020–2050) that typically focus the attention on drivers of disaggregated flows of climate finance and policies. The upward trends of the cycles tend to favour speculative bubbles like real estates at the expense of investment in production and infrastructures whereas the asymmetric downsides raise uncertainty and risks for longer-term investments on newer climate technologies, and favour a flight to near-term safety (e.g., lowest risk non-climate short-term treasury investments, highest creditworthy countries, and away from cross-border investments (<a class="section-link" data-title="Considerations on Financing Gaps and Drivers" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.5">Section 15.5</a>) – making the challenge of longer-term low-carbon transition more difficult. In this respect, the impact of financial regulation is unclear. On the one hand, it could be argued that the tighter bank regulations under Basel III, combined with an economic environment with higher uncertainty and flatter yield curve, can push banks to retrench from climate finance projects (<a class="reference-link" href="#Blended%20Finance%20Taskforce--2018a">Blended Finance Taskforce, 2018a</a>), since banks tend to limit loan maturity to five or eight years, while infrastructure projects typically require the amortisation of debt over 15 to 20 years (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arezki--2016">Arezki et al. 2016</a>).

The attention to ‘bankability’ does not however address access and equity issues (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bayliss--2018">Bayliss and Van Waeyenberge 2018</a>). Some significant gains in climate financing at the sectoral and microeconomic levels were nevertheless happening in specific segments, such as solar energy financing and labelled green bonds (although how much of such labelled financing is incremental to unlabelled financing that might have happened anyway remains uncertain) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tolliver--2019">Tolliver et al. 2019</a>). Issues of ‘labelling’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cornell--2020">Cornell 2020</a>) apply even more to ESG (environmental, social and governance) investments, which started to grow rapidly after 2016 (<a class="section-link" data-title="Widen the Focus of Relevant Actors: Role of Communities, Cities and Subnational Levels" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.6.5">Section 15.6.5</a>). Overall, these increments for climate finance remained, however, small in aggregate relative to the size of the shifts in climate financing required in the coming decade. Annual energy investments in developing regions (other than China) which account for two-thirds of the world population, with least costs of mitigation per tonne of emissions (one-half that in developed regions), and for the bulk of future expected global GHG emissions, saw a 20% decline since 2016, and only a one-fifth share of global clean energy investment, reflecting persistent financing problems and costs of mobilising finance towards clean energy transition, even prior to the pandemic (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2021a">IEA 2021a</a>). In the words of a macroeconomic institution, ‘tangible policy responses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have been grossly insufficient to date’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#IMF--2020a">IMF 2020a</a>).

Almost two years after the pandemic started, it is still too uncertain and early to conclude impacts of the pandemic until 2025–2030, especially as they affect climate finance. Multiple waves of the pandemic, new virus mutations, accumulating human toll, and growing vaccine coverage but vastly differing access across developed versus developing regions, are evident. They are causing divergent impacts across sectors and countries, which combined with the divergent ability of countries and regions to mount sufficient fiscal and monetary policy actions imply continued high uncertainty on the economic recovery paths from the crisis. The situation remains more precarious in middle- and low-income developing countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#IMF--2021a">IMF 2021a</a>). While recovery is happening, the job losses have been large, poverty rates have climbed, public health systems are suffering long-term consequences, education gains have been set back, public debt levels are higher (5–10% of GDP higher), financial institutions have come under longer-term stress, a larger number of developing countries are facing debt distress, and many key high-contact sectors, such as tourism and trade, will take time to recover (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eichengreen--2021">Eichengreen et al. 2021</a>). The implication is negative headwinds for climate finance with public attention focused on pandemic relief and recovery and limited (and divergent) fiscal headroom for a low-carbon transition, with considerable uncertainties ahead (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hepburn--2020b">Hepburn et al. 2020b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Maffettone--2020">Maffettone and Oldani 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Steffen--2020">Steffen et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The larger and still open public policy choice question that COVID-19 now raises is whether there is room for public policy globally and in respect of their individual economies to integrate climate more centrally to their growth, jobs and sustainable development strategies worldwide for ecological and economic survival. The outcomes will depend on the robustness of recovery from the pandemic, and the still evolving public policy responses to the climate agenda in the recovery process. Private equity and asset markets have recovered surprisingly rapidly during the pandemic (in response to the massive fiscal and central bank actions generating large excess savings with very low or negative yields boosting stock markets). On public spending, some early studies suggest that the immediate economic recovery packages were falling well short of being sufficiently climate sustainable (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gosens--2020">Gosens and Jotzo 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kuzemko--2020">Kuzemko et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Callaghan--2021">O’Callaghan 2021</a>) but several governments have also announced intentions to spend more on a green recovery, ‘build back better’ and Just Transition efforts (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Finance and Just Transition" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.2.4">Section 15.2.4</a>), although outcomes remain highly uncertain (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lehmann--2021">Lehmann et al. 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Markandya--2021">Markandya et al. 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">An important immediate finding from the COVID-19 crisis was that the slowdown in economic activity is illustrating some of these choices: immediately after the onset, more costly and carbon-intensive coal use for energy use tumbled in major countries such as China and the USA, while the forced ‘stay-at-home’ policies adopted around the major economies of the world led to a –30–35% decline in individual country GDP, and was in turn associated with a decrease in daily global CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions by –26% at their peak in individual countries, and –17% globally (–11 to –25% for ±1<span class="•-Calibri-Greek">σ</span>) by early April 2020 compared with the mean 2019 levels, with just under half coming from changes in surface transport, city congestion and country mobility (<a class="reference-link" href="#Le%20Qu%C3%A9r%C3%A9--2020">Le Quéré et al. 2020</a>). Along with the carbon emissions drop was a dramatic improvement in other parameters such as clean air quality. Moreover, longer-term behavioural impacts are also possible: a dramatic acceleration of digital technologies in communications, travel, retail trade and transport. The question however is whether the world might revert to the earlier carbon-intensive path of recovery, or to a different future, and the choice of policies in shaping this future. Studies generally suggest that the gains from long-term impacts of the pandemic on future global warming will be limited and depend more on the nature of public policy actions and long-term commitments by countries to raise their ambitions, not just on climate but on sustainable development broadly (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barbier--2020">Barbier 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Barbier--2020">Barbier and Burgess 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Forster--2020">Forster et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gillingham--2020">Gillingham et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Reilly--2021">Reilly et al. 2021</a>).

The implications for a Just Transition in climate finance are clear: expanding equitable and greater access to climate finance for vulnerable countries, communities and sectors, not just for the most profitable private investment opportunities, and a larger role for public finance in fulfilling existing finance commitments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bracking--2021">Bracking and Leffel 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kuhl--2021">Kuhl 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Long--2021">Long 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2021">Roberts et al. 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Large shocks such as pandemics, and slow-growing ones such as climate, are typically known to worsen inequality (<a class="reference-link" href="#IMF%20and%20World%20Bank--2020">IMF and </a><a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2020">World Bank 2020</a> ).

Because private investors and financing mostly deal with allocation to climate finance at a global portfolio level, then to allocation by countries, and finally to individual projects, the challenge for them is to refocus attention to Just Transition issues at the country level, but also globally as well as locally (in other words, at all three levels).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Climate finance will likely face greater challenges in the post-pandemic context (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hanna--2020">Hanna et al. 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Henry--2020">Henry et al. 2020</a>).

Shifting to a grant equivalent net flows definition of climate finance, which is now universally accepted for all other aid flows by all parties since 2014 and which took effect since 2019 on every other public international good finance provision (under the SDGs), with the sole exception of climate finance, would resolve many uncertainties: the disbursement of climate finance flows on a grant equivalent basis that is comparable across institutions, instruments and countries, and measurement with greater accuracy about the effective transfer of resources. The journey to get to a clear and precise definition of net official overseas development assistance (ODA) took time. The original proposal was first initiated in the 1960s (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pincus--1963">Pincus 1963</a>) but it was not till multilateral development banks (MDBs) and others laid out the compelling reasons why (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chang--1998">Chang et al. 1998</a>) that this was accomplished: especially to resolve decades of confusion and inconsistency between different types of financial flows and hence the perennial measurement problems and ‘the compromise between political expediency and statistical reality’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bulow--2005">Bulow and Rogoff 2005</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hynes--2013">Hynes and Scott 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Scott--2015">Scott 2015</a>, 2017).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A third related and increasingly crucial priority is to expedite the operational definition of blended finance and promote the use of public guarantee instruments. Private flows to accelerate the low-carbon transition in developing countries would benefit enormously, by gaining clearer access to public international funds and support defined on a grant equivalent basis, provided development and climate finance operational definitions and procedures were improved on an urgent basis (<a class="reference-link" href="#Blended%20Finance%20Taskforce--2018a">Blended Finance Taskforce 2018a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#OECD-DAC--2021">OECD-DAC 2021</a>). When blended and supported by public finance and policy, the grant equivalency measure can easily and more accurately measure the value and benefit of blended public and private finance by comparing the effective interest cost (and volume) gain with such financing, against the benchmark costs without such blending. Here again, a pressing challenge is to improve the operational definitions of what counts as ODA within blended finance. Blended finance remains very poorly defined and accounted (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pereira--2017">Pereira 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Andersen--2019">Andersen et al. 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Attridge--2019">Attridge and Engen 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Basile--2019">Basile and Dutra 2019</a>).

Largely because of such official uncertainty the actual flows of blended finance and guarantees continue to remain a very small share (typically, less than 5%) of official and multilateral finance flows to lower project risks and costs, and hence the potential for large-scale accelerated low-carbon private investments in developing countries. Public guarantees can offer a fifteen times multiplier effect on the scale of low-carbon investments generated with such support, compared to a 1:1 ratio in direct financing (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hourcade--2021a">Hourcade et al. 2021a</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">It makes sense to expedite these operational procedures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Khan--2020">Khan et al. 2020</a>) which cannot be otherwise explained except in terms of avoiding responsibilities, even where the benefits would be high (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kl%C3%B6ck--2018">Klöck et al. 2018</a>).

Political leadership and direction will be again crucial to enhance their roles.

Only national governments have the ability to borrow more in their fiscal accounts to address large collective problems, whether pandemics or climate change. Therefore, it is important that national policies and funds be available for programmes to address the Just Transition issues for larger subnational states, cities and regions.

In 2019, global GFCF reached around 20 trillion USD<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2015</span> compared to around 14 trillion USD<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2015</span> in 2010, a more than 40% increase (Figure 15.2). Global GFCF represents about a quarter of global GDP, a relatively stable ratio since 2008. This share is, however, much higher for emerging economies, notably in Asia, which are building new infrastructure at scale. As analysed in Sections 15.4 and 15.5, infrastructure investment needs and gaps in developing countries are significant. How these are met over the next decade will critically influence the likelihood of reaching the Paris Agreement goals.</p><div class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" id="_idContainer010"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" id="figure-15-2" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Figure_15_2.png"></span></span></p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Figure 15.2 | Financial flows – GFCF (trillion USD</span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2015</span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">) by type of economy (left) and region (right). </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>Note: Regional breakdown based on official UN country classification.

Different interpretations relate mainly to the type and proportion of activities that may qualify as ‘climate’ on the one hand, and to how to account for different types of finance (and financial instruments) on the other hand. As an example, there are different points at which financing can be measured, for example, pledges, commitments, disbursements. There can be significant lags between these different points in time, for example disbursements may spread over time. Further, the choice of point of measurement can have an impact on both the volumes and on the characteristics (geographical origin, labelling as public or private) of the finance tracked.

Also, financing needs are used as an indicator for required system changes (when compared to current flows and asset bases) and an indicator for near- to long-term investment opportunities from the perspective of investors and corporates. Investment needs are widely used as an indicator focusing on initial investments required to realise new infrastructure. It compares relatively well with private sector flows dominated by return-generating investments but lacks comparability and explanatory power regarding the needs in the context of international climate cooperation, where considerations on economic costs play a more substantial role. <a class="section-link" data-title="Cross sectoral perspectives" href="/chapters/chapter-12">Chapter 12</a> elaborates on global economic cost estimates for various technologies. This indicator includes both costs and benefits of options, of which investment-related costs make up only one component. Both analyses offer complementary insights. There are financing needs not directly related to the realisation of physical infrastructure and which are not covered in both investment and cost estimates. For instance, the needs for building institutional capacity to achieve social and economic goals and to strengthen knowledge, skills, national and international cooperation might not be significant, but an enabling environment for future investments would not be established without satisfying it.

Most of the finance is mobilised domestically but the depth of capital markets is substantially greater in developed countries, increasing the challenges to mobilise substantial volumes of additional financing for many developing countries. The same applies to various stakeholders with limited connections into the financial sector. In addition, governments enabling financial market frameworks, guidelines and supportive infrastructure is crucial for inclusive finance for the bottom of the pyramid, especially disadvantaged and economically marginalised segments of society.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The attractiveness of a sector and region for capital markets depends on several factors. Some essential elements are the duration of loan and profile as long-term loans and heavily heterogeneous returns represent challenges in financing mitigation technologies and policies. After the financial crisis and restricted access to long-term debt, capital intensity of technologies and resulting long payback periods of investment opportunities for mitigation technologies have been a crucial challenge (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bertoldi--2021">Bertoldi et al. 2021</a>). Also, implicit discount rates applied during the investment decision process vary depending on the payback profile, with research mainly covering the difference between the financing of assets generating revenues versus costs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jaffe--2004">Jaffe et al. 2004</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schleich--2016">Schleich et al. 2016</a>).

Transaction cost is a significant barrier to the diffusion and commercialisation of low-carbon technologies and business models and adaptation action. High transaction costs, attributed to various factors, such as complexity and limited standardisation of investments, limited pipelines, complex institutional and administrative procedures, create significant opportunity costs of green investments comparing with other standard investments (<a class="reference-link" href="#IRENA--2016">IRENA 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nelson--2016">Nelson et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Feldman--2018">Feldman et al. 2018</a>). For example, transaction costs are commonly observed in small-scale, dispersed independent renewable energy systems, especially in rural areas, and energy efficiency projects (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hunecke--2019">Hunecke et al. 2019</a>). A more robust standardisation and alignment of Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) terms with best practices globally has led to a substantially increased interest in capital markets in developing countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#WBCSD--2016">WBCSD 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schmidt--2019">Schmidt et al. 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2021"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2021">World Bank 2021</a> ). Notably, PPA significantly increases the probability of more balanced investment and development outcomes and ultimately more sustainable independent power projects in developing countries. Therefore, lowering transaction costs would be essential for creating investor appetite. The role of intermediaries bundling demand for financing has been demonstrated to reduce transaction costs and to reach investors’ critical size. In addition, new innovative approaches, such as fintech and blockchain (<a class="section-link" data-title="Facilitating the" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.6.8">Section 15.6.8</a>), have been discussed for providing new opportunities in the energy sector.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Economic viability of investments – ideally not relying on the pricing of positive externalities – has been a critical driver of momentum in the past.

Renewable energy technologies are now often competitive, and have even become the cheapest, in many countries, even without financial support (<a class="reference-link" href="#FS-UNEP%20Centre%20and%20BNEF--2015">FS-UNEP Centre and BNEF 2015</a>, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2020c">IEA 2020c</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IRENA--2020a">IRENA 2020a</a>) and without pricing of the avoided carbon emissions. In contrast, the dependency on regulatory interventions and public financial support to create financial viability has provided a source of volatile investor appetite. The annual volume of renewable investment by country is often volatile, reflecting ending and new regulations and policies (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2019a">IEA 2019a</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">For example, the recent Chinese policy direction towards tougher access to and a substantial cut in feed-in-tariffs in 2018 led to a significant drop in renewable investment and new capacity addition in China (FS-UNEP Centre and <a class="reference-link" href="#BNEF--2019">BNEF 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hove--2020">Hove 2020</a>). However, the significant bouncing back of newly installed capacity (72 GW wind power and 47 GW solar power in 2020) shows the strong development of zero-carbon power generation driven by lower cost and policies to support them by energy revolution strategies in China. Investors had proven to be willing to work with transparent support mechanisms, such as with the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which stimulated emission reductions and allowed industrialised countries to implement emission-reduction projects in developing countries to meet their emission targets (<a class="reference-link" href="#Michaelowa--2019">Michaelowa et al. 2019</a>). However, the collapse of carbon markets and prices, especially of the EU Emissions Trading System, led to the continuous decline of Certified Emission Reductions issuances from CDM in the past years (<a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank%20Group--2020">World Bank Group 2020</a>). Also, the dependency on regulatory intervention to ensure fair market access only has proven to burden investor appetite.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">A significant share of investment needs in heavily regulated sectors, such as electricity, public transport, and telecom, emphasises the importance of regulatory intervention, such as ownership and market access (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2017b">OECD 2017b</a>). For instance, energy-system developments require effective and credible commitments and action by policymakers to ensure an efficient capital allocation aligned with climate targets (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bertram--2021">Bertram et al. 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">There is a lot of discussion about the regulated ownership of the private sector (European Commission 2017) and the restructuring of electricity market contributed to low level of investment in baseline electricity capacity and in investment research and innovation. These changes create uncertainty of investment, and barriers to market entry and exit also potentially limit the competition in the market and restrict the entrance of new investment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Finon--2006">Finon 2006</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Joskow--2007">Joskow 2007</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Grubb--2018">Grubb and Newbery 2018</a>).

First movers realised these projects with investors and developers acting from conviction (<a class="reference-link" href="#Steffen--2018">Steffen et al. 2018</a>). Such action is not possible to this extent in energy efficiency with related investment rather representing an add-on component and consequently requiring the support of decision-makers used to business-as-usual projects. Despite the benefits that improvement of energy efficiency has in contributing to curbing energy consumption, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and providing multiple co-benefits (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2014a">IEA 2014a</a>), investment in energy efficiency is a low priority for firms, and the financial environment is not favourable due to lack of awareness of energy efficiency by financial institutions, existing administrative barriers, lack of expertise to develop projects, asymmetric information, and split incentives (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP%20DTU--2017">UNEP DTU 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cattaneo--2019">Cattaneo 2019</a>). While Energy Service Companies’ (ESCO) business models are expected to facilitate the investment in energy efficiency by sharing a portion of financial risk and providing expertise, there has been limited progress made with ESCO business models, and only slightly over 20% of projects used financing through ESCOs (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP%20DTU--2017">UNEP DTU 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The investment needs and existing challenges differ by sector. Each sector has different characteristics along the arguments listed above making the supply of finance by commercial investors an enabling factor or barrier. In the transport sector, transformation towards green mobility would provide significant co-benefits for human health by reducing transport-related air pollution, so the transport sector cannot achieve such transformation in isolation from other sectors. However, a considerable involvement of the public sector in many transportation infrastructure projects is given, and the absence of a standard solution increases transaction costs (including bidding package, estimating, drawing up a contract, administering the contract, corruption, and so on). Financial constraints, including access to adequate finance, pose a significant challenge in the agriculture sector, especially for SMEs and smallholder farmers. The distortion created by government failure and a lack of effective policies create barriers to financing for agriculture. The inability to manage the impact of the agriculture-related risks, such as seasonality, increases uncertainty in financial management. Moreover, inadequate infrastructure, such as electricity and telecommunication, makes it difficult for financial institutions to reach agricultural SMEs and farmers and increases transaction costs (<a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2016">World Bank 2016</a>). Low economies of scale, low bargaining power, poor connectivity to markets, and information asymmetry also lead to higher transaction costs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pingali--2019">Pingali et al. 2019</a>). In the industrial manufacturing and residential sector, gaining energy efficiency remains one of the critical challenges. Investment in achieving energy efficiency encounters some challenges when it may not necessarily generate direct or indirect benefits, such as increase in production capacity or productivity and improvement in product quality. Also, early-stage, high upfront cost and future, stable revenue stream structure suggest the needs for a better enabling environment, such as a robust financial market, awareness of financial institutions, and regulatory frameworks (e.g., stringent building codes, incentives for ESCOs) (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2014a">IEA 2014a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Barnsley--2015">Barnsley et al. 2015</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="15.4.2"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">15.4.2</span>Quantitative Assessment of Financing Needs <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-9-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Multiple stakeholders prepare and present quantitative financing needs assessments with methodologies applied to vary significantly representing a major challenge for aggregation of needs (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Osama--2021">Osama et al. (2021)</a> for African countries), most of them with a focus on scenarios likely to limit warming to 2°C or lower. The differences relate to the scope of the assessments regarding sectors, regions and periods, top-down versus bottom-up approaches, and methodological issues around boundaries of climate-related investment needs, particularly full vs incremental costs and the exclusion or inclusion of consumer-level investments. Information on investment needs and financing options in NDCs mirrors this challenge and is heavily heterogeneous (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2016">Zhang and Pan 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In particular, for global approaches, modelling assumptions are often heavily standardised, focusing on technology costs. Only limited global analysis is available on incremental costs and investments, reflecting the reality of developing countries, also considering the interplay with significant infrastructure finance gaps, and can hardly serve as a robust basis for negotiations about international public climate finance. The focus on investment irrespective of uncertainty as well as other qualitative aspects of needs does not allow for a straightforward analysis of the need for public finance to leverage private sector financing and of the country heterogeneity in terms of investment risks and access to capital (Clark et al. 2018).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">One source of uncertainty about the investment estimates for the power sector is the evolution of the levelised cost of technical options in the future, for example the continuation of the observed declining costs trends of renewable energy (<a class="reference-link" href="#IRENA--2020b">IRENA 2020b</a>) which has been underestimated in many modelling exercises. The learning by doing processes and economies of scale might be at least partially outweighed, in all countries and more specifically in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and other developing countries because of different risk factors, scales of installations, accessibility, and others (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lucas--2015">Lucas et al. 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#van%20der%20Zwaan--2018">van der Zwaan et al. 2018</a>). These parameters, together with transaction costs/soft costs (<a class="section-link" data-title="Considerations on Financing Gaps and Drivers" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.5">Section 15.5</a>), financing costs and the level of technical competences need to be better represented in the future to represent the ‘climate investment trap’ in many developing countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Garc%C3%ADa%20de%20Fonseca--2019">García de Fonseca et al. 2019</a>). This ‘climate investment trap’, as flagged by <a class="reference-link" href="#Ameli--2021a">Ameli et al. (2021a)</a>, is created by existing and expected physical effects of climate change, higher financing costs and resulting lower investment levels in developing countries. Applying significantly standardised assumptions can consequently not provide robust insights for specific country groups. This will require progress in the spatiotemporal granularity of the models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Collins--2016">Collins et al. 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Another source of uncertainty about the financing needs is the interplays between (i) the baseline economic growth rates, (ii) the link between economic growth and energy demand, including rebound effects of energy efficiency gains, (iii) the evolution of microeconomic parameters such as fossil fuel prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates (iv) the level of integration between climate policies and sectoral policies and their efficacy, and (v) the impact of climate policies on growth and the capacity of fiscal and financial policies to offset their adverse effect (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014">IPCC 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC 2018</a>). Integrated assessment models (IAMs) try to capture some of these interplays even though they typically do not capture the financial constraints and the structural causes of the infrastructure investment gap. Many of them rely on growth models with full exploitation of the means of production (labour and capital). They nevertheless provide useful indications of the orders of magnitude at play over the long run, and the determinants of their uncertainty. Global yearly average low-carbon investment needs until 2030 for electricity, transportation, AFOLU and energy efficiency measures including industry and buildings are estimated between 3% and 6% of the world’s GDP according to the analysis in <a class="section-link" data-title="Considerations on Financing Gaps and Drivers" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.5">Section 15.5</a>. The incremental costs of low-carbon options are less than that and their funding could be achieved without reducing global consumption by reallocating 1.4% to 3.9% of global savings. 2.4% on average (see Box 4.8 of SR1.5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC 2018</a>)) currently flow towards real estate, land and liquid financial vehicles.

Taking into account the much broader range of tested and untested technologies the confidence levels, in particular for 2050 estimates, remain low but can provide an initial indication. Also, the ranges allow for a rough indication on possible ‘green’ investment volumes and respective asset allocation for financial sector stakeholders.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Using global scenarios assessed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Mitigation pathways compatible with long-term goals" href="/chapters/chapter-3">Chapter 3</a> for assessing investment requirements. </span>Tables 15.2 and 15.3 present the analysis of investment requirements in global modelled mitigation pathways assessed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Mitigation pathways compatible with long-term goals" href="/chapters/chapter-3">Chapter 3</a> for key energy sub-sectors within modelled global pathways that limit warming to 2°C (&gt;67%) or lower. These pathways explore the energy, land-use, and climate system interactions and thus help identify required energy sector transformations to reach specific long-term climate targets. However, reporting of investment needs outside the energy sector was scarce, reducing the explanatory power of the shown total investment need in the context of overall investment needs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ekholm--2013">Ekholm et al. 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC 2018</a>, Box 4.8; <a class="reference-link" href="#McCollum--2018">McCollum et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bertram--2021">Bertram et al. 2021</a>). The modelling of these scenarios is done with a variation of scenario assumptions along different dimensions (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">inter alia</span> policy, socio-economic development and technology availability), as well as with different modelling tools which represent different assumptions about the structural functioning of the energy-economy-land-use system (see Annex III: ‘Scenarios and modelling methods’ for details). Tables 15.2 and 15.3 focus on the near-term (2023–2032) investment requirements in the energy sector and how these differ depending on temperature category. Figures 3.36 and 3.37 present the data for the medium term (2023–2052). The results highlight both requirements for increased investments and a shift from fossil towards renewable technologies and efficiency for more ambitious temperature categories. The substantial ranges within each category reflect multiple pathways, differentiated by socio-economic assumptions, technology, and so on. It is necessary to open up these extra dimensions and contrast them with national and sub-regional analysis to understand how investment requirements depend on particular circumstances and assumptions within a country for a specific technology. Limiting peak temperature to levels of 1.5°C–2°C requires rapid decarbonisation of the global energy systems, with the fastest relative emission reductions occurring in the power generation sector (<a

Electricity subcomponents are not exhaustive. Hydro, geothermal, biomass and others are not shown, as these are shown to be of smaller magnitude (Chapter 3). Difference between non-biomass renewables and solar/wind represents hydro and in some scenarios geothermal, tidal, and ocean. Scenarios are grouped into common AR6 categories (vertical axis, C1–C3). The numbers represent medians across all scenarios within one category, and rounded brackets indicate inter-quartile ranges, while the numbers in squared brackets indicate number of scenarios. C6, C7, and C8 are not shown in Table 15.2. Reference C5 category for Transmission and Distribution (T&amp;D) is 364bn (294bn to 445bn) [111] used for calculation of incremental needs in Figure 15.4.

Overall, electricity generation investments increase considerably, reflecting the higher relevance of capital expenditures in decarbonised electricity systems. While decreasing technology costs have substantially reduced the challenge of high capital intensity, still remaining relative disadvantages in terms of capital intensity of low-carbon power technologies can especially create obstacles for fast decarbonisation in countries with high interest rates, which decrease the competitiveness of those technologies (Iyer et al. 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hirth--2016">Hirth and Steckel 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Steckel--2018">Steckel and Jakob 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schmidt--2019">Schmidt et al. 2019</a>).

Given rising GDP, the complementary methods and sources thus consistently point to a peak in electricity supply investments as a percentage of GDP in mitigation scenarios in the coming decade. This reflects the fact that the coming decade requires low-carbon power generation investments to both cover the demand increase and (partly premature) replacement of fossil generation capacities, both concentrated in emerging and developing countries. Relative investment numbers for electricity measured against GDP then decrease towards 2050, as they only need to cover natural replacement and increasing demands (which due to electrification will also pick up in developed countries), and due to further declining technology costs. Investments for low-carbon fuel supply like hydrogen and synthetic fuels, and for direct electrification equipment (heat pumps, electric vehicles (EV), etc.) scale up from much lower levels and will likely continue to grow as a share of GDP until mid-century, though uncertainties and accounting is still much more uncertain.

In particular, attention must accelerate on low-income Africa. This large continent currently contributes very little to global emissions, but its rapidly rising energy demands and renewable energy potential versus its growing reliance on fossil fuels and ‘cheap’ biomass (especially fuelwood for cooking and charcoal, with impacts on deforestation) amid fast-rising urbanisation makes it imperative that institutional investors and policymakers recognise the very large ‘leap-frog’ potential for the renewable energy transition as well as risks of lock-in effects in infrastructure more generally in Africa that is critical to hold the global temperatures rise to well below 2°C in the longer term (2020–2050). Overlooking this transition opportunity, rivalling China, India, USA and Europe, would be costly. Policies centred around the accelerated development of local capital markets for energy transitions – with support from external grants, supra-national guarantees and recognition of carbon remediation assets – are crucial options here, as in other low-income countries and regional settings. Notably, climate finance flows to African countries might have even decreased for mitigation technology deployment (stagnated for adaptation between 2017 and 2020), widening the finance gap in African countries in the recent years (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">hig</span><span class="•-Condensed-italic">h confidence</span>)<span class="•-Condensed-italic">. </span></p><div class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" id="figure-15-4"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" id="figure-15-4" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Figure_15_4.png"></span></span></p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Figure 15.4 | Breakdown of recent average (downstream) mitigation investments and model-based investment requirements for 2020–2030 (USD billion) in scenarios that likely limit warming to 2°C or lower. </span></span>Mitigation investment flows and model-based investment requirements by sector / segment (energy efficiency in buildings and industry, transport including efficiency, electricity generation, transmission and distribution including electrification, and agriculture, forestry and other land use), by type of economy, and by region (see Annex II Part I Section 1: By region is based on intermediate level (R10) classification scheme. By type of economy is based on intermediate level (R10) classification scheme, which considers ‘North America’, ‘Europe’, and ’Australia, Japan and New Zealand’ as developed countries, and the other seven regions as developing countries). Breakdown by sector / segment may differ slightly from sectoral analysis in other contexts due to the availability of investment needs data. The granularity of the models assessed in Chapter 3, and other studies, do not allow for a robust assessment of the specific investment needs of LDCs or SIDSs. Investment requirements in developing countries might be underestimated due to missing data points as well as underestimated technology costs. In modelled pathways, regional investments are projected to occur when and where they are cost cost-effective to limit global warming.

Data includes investments with a direct mitigation effect, and in the case of electricity, additional transmission and distribution investments. See section 15.4.2 Quantitative assessment of financing needs for detailed data on investment requirements. Data on mitigation investment flows are based on a single series of reports (Climate Policy Initiative, CPI) which assembles data from multiple sources. Investment flows for energy efficiency are adjusted based on data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Data on mitigation investments do not include technical assistance (i.e., policy and national budget support or capacity building), other non-technology deployment financing. Adaptation only flows are also excluded. Data on mitigation investment requirements for electricity are based on emission pathways C1, C2 and C3 (Table SPM.1). For electricity investment requirements, the upper end refers to the mean of C1 pathways and the lower end to the mean of C3 pathways. Data points for energy efficiency, transport and AFOLU cannot always be linked to C1–C3 scenarios. Data do not include needs for adaptation or general infrastructure investment or investment related to meeting the SDGs other than mitigation, which may be at least partially required to facilitate mitigation. The multiplication factors show the ratio of average annual model-based mitigation investment requirements (2020–2030) and most recent annual mitigation investments (averaged for 2017–2020). The lower and upper multiplication factors refer to the lower and upper ends of the range of investment needs.</p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-table-note---no-title" lang="en-US">Given the multiple sources and lack of harmonised methodologies, the data can only be indicative of the size and pattern of investment gaps. The gap between most recent flows and required investments is only a single indicator. A more comprehensive (and qualitative) assessment is required in order to understand the magnitude of the challenge of scaling up investment in sectors and regions. The analysis also does not consider the effects of misaligned flows. <!-- -->{15.3, 15.4, 15.5, Table 15.2, Table 15.3, Table 15.4}</p></div><div class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" id="figure-15-4"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-5" id="figure-15-5" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Figure_15_5.png"></span></span></p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Figure 15.5 | Visual abstract to address financing gaps in Se</span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">ction 15. </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">6. </span></p></div><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Over 80% of climate finance is reported to originate and stay within borders, and even higher for private climate flows (over 90%) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Boissinot--2016">Boissinot et al. 2016</a>). There are multiple reasons for such ‘home bias’ in finance – national policy support, differences in regulatory standards, exchange rate, political and governance risks, as well as information market failures. The extensive home bias means that even if national actions are announced and intended to be implemented unilaterally and voluntarily, the ability to implement them requires access to climate finance which is constrained by the relative ability of financial and capital markets at home to provide such financing, and access to global capital markets that requires supporting institutional policies in source countries. ‘Enabling’ public policies and actions locally (cities, states, countries and regions), to reduce investment risks and boost domestic climate capital markets financing, and to enlarge the pool of external climate financing sources with policy support from source capital countries thus matters at a general level. The biggest challenge in climate finance is likely to be in developing countries, even in the presence of enabling policies and quite apart from any other considerations such as equity and climate justice (<a class="reference-link" href="#Klinsky--2017">Klinsky et al. 2017</a>) or questions about the equitable allocations of future ‘climate budgets’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gignac--2015">Gignac and Matthews 2015</a>). The differentiation between developed and developing countries matters most on financing. Most developed countries have already achieved very high levels of incomes, have the largest pool of capital stock and financial capital (which can be more easily redeployed within these countries given the home bias of financial markets), the most well-developed financial markets and the highest sovereign credit ratings, in addition to starting with very high levels of per capita carbon consumption – factors that should allow the fastest adjustment to low-carbon investments and transition in these countries from domestic policies alone. The financial and economic circumstances are more challenging in many developing countries, even within a heterogeneity of circumstances across countries. The dilemma, however, is that the fastest rates of the expected increase in future carbon emissions are in developing countries. The biggest challenge of climate finance globally is thus likely to be the constraints to climate financing because of the opportunity costs and relative under-development of capital markets and financing constraints (and costs) at home in developing countries, and the relative availability or absence of adequate financing policy support internationally from developed countries. The Paris Agreement and commitment by developed countries to support the climate financing needs of developing countries thus continue to matter a great deal.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Soft costs/institutional capacity</span> (<a class="reference-link" href="#Osama--2021">Osama et al. 2021</a>). Most funding needs assessments focus on technology costs and ignore the cascade of financing needs as outlined above. International grant funding or national budget allocations for soft costs like the creation of a regulatory environment can be a prerequisite for the supply of commercial financing for the deployment of technologies. Such critical funding needs might represent a small share of overall investment needs but current (relatively small) gaps in funding of policy reforms can hinder or delay deployment of large volumes of funding in later years. The role, as well as the approximate volumes of such required timely international grant funding or national budget allocations, appear underestimated in research. The numbers available for the creation of an enabling environment for medium-sized renewable energy (RE) projects in Uganda (<a class="reference-link" href="#GET%20FiT%20Uganda--2018">GET FiT Uganda 2018</a>) are illustrative only and cannot be transferred as assumptions to other countries without taking into account potentially varying starting points in terms of institutional readiness, pipelines, as well as the general business environment. GET FiT Uganda supported 170 MWp of medium-scale RE capacity triggering investments of USD453 million (<a class="reference-link" href="#GET%20FiT%20Uganda--2018">GET FiT Uganda 2018</a>), international results-based incremental cost support amounted to USD92 million and project preparation, technical assistance, and implementation support, required USD8 million, excluding support from national agencies.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">There is strong evidence of the correlation between institutional capacity of countries and international climate finance flows towards those economies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adenle--2017">Adenle et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Stender--2019">Stender et al. 2019</a>) and a strong need for robust institutional capacity to manage the transformation in a sustainable and human rights based way (<a class="reference-link" href="#Duyck--2018">Duyck et al. 2018</a>). Oneexample to consider unaddressed social concerns is the ongoing call for feedback by the European Commission and its platform on sustainable finance. It argues for a social taxonomy, that can support the identification of financing opportunities for economic activities contributing to social objectives (<a class="reference-link" href="#European%20Commission--2021b">European Commission 2021b</a>). SEforAll has highlighted the issue of investments not going to the countries with the greatest need, also partly driven by institutional capacity levels (SEforALL and <a class="reference-link" href="#CPI--2020">CPI 2020</a>). Also, most of the developing countries’ NDCs are conditional upon international support for capacity building (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pauw--2020">Pauw et al. 2020</a>). The Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) was created as an operational arm of the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism with the mandate to respond to requests from developing countries. Initial evaluations of the mechanism underpin its importance and value for developing countries but stress long lead times and predictability of future international public finance to maintain operations as key challenges (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2017">UNFCCC 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#DANIDA--2018">DANIDA 2018</a>). While limited pipelines, limited absorptive capacities as well as restricted institutional capacity of countries are often stated as challenges for an accelerated deployment of finance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adenle--2017">Adenle et al. 2017</a>), the question remains on the role of international public climate finance to address this gap and whether a concrete current financing gap exists for patient institutional capacity building. While current short-term, mostly project-related, capacity building often fails to meet needs but alternative, well-structured patient interventions and finance could play an important role (<a class="reference-link" href="#Saldanha--2006">Saldanha 2006</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hope--2011">Hope 2011</a>) accepting other barriers than financing playing a role as well.

Also, SE4All has underpinned the need for an expansion of available business models to achieve universal access (SEforALL and <a class="reference-link" href="#CPI--2020">CPI 2020</a>). Further research and development needs range from resource efficiency of proven technologies and next generation technologies but also new technologies (Chapter 16). Access to early stage financing remains critical with performance in recent years being weak (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gaddy--2016">Gaddy et al. 2016</a>). This historically weak performance of clean tech start-ups burdens the interest of investors in the sector on the one hand and discourages experienced executive talent (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wang--2020">Wang and Yee 2020</a>).

However, knowledge gaps in the assessment of climate-related financial risk are a key barrier to such climate finance flows. Therefore, this section discusses the main knowledge gaps that are currently being addressed in the literature and those that remain outstanding.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Climate-related financial risk is meant here as the potential adverse impact of climate change on the value of financial assets. A recent but remarkable development since AR5 is that climate change has been explicitly recognised by financial supervisors as a source of financial risk that matters both for financial institutions and citizens’ savings (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bolton--2020">Bolton et al. 2020</a>). Previously, climate change was mostly regarded in the finance community only as an ethical issue. The reasons why climate change implies financial risk are not new and are discussed more in detail below. What is new is that climate enters now as a factor in the assessment of financial institutions’ risk (e.g., the European Central Bank or the European Banking Authority) and credit rating (<a class="section-link" data-title="Co" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.6.3">Section 15.6.3</a>), and, going forward, into stress-test exercises. This implies changes in incentives of the supervised financial actors, both public and private, and thus changes in the landscape of mitigation action by generating a new potential for climate finance flows. However, critical knowledge gaps remain. In particular, the underestimation of climate-related financial risk by public and private financial actors can explain that the current allocation of capital among financial institutions is often inconsistent with the mitigation objectives (Rempel et al. 2020). Moreover, even a correct assessment of risk, which could provide incentives for divesting from carbon-intensive activities, does not necessarily lead to investing in the technical options needed for deep decarbonisation. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the low-carbon transition require to fill in at the same time gaps about risk and gaps about investments in enabling activities in a broader sense.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Physical risk. </span>On the one hand, unmitigated climate change implies an increased potential for adverse socio-economic impacts especially in more exposed economic activities and areas (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>). Accordingly, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">physical risk</span> refers to the component of financial risk associated with the adverse physical impact of hazards related to climate change (e.g., extreme weather events or sea level rise) on the financial value of assets such as industrial plants or real estate. In turn, these losses can translate into losses on the values of financial assets issued by exposed companies (e.g., equity/bonds) and or sovereign entities as well as losses for insurance companies. The assessment of climate financial physical risks poses challenges in terms of data, methods and scenarios. It requires cross-match scenarios of climate-related hazards at granular geographical scale, with the geolocation and financial value of physical assets. The relationship between the value of physical assets (such as plants or real estate) and the financial value of securities issued by the owners of those assets is not straightforward.

The term <span class="•-Condensed-italic">carbon stranded assets</span> refers to fossil fuel-related assets (fuel or equipment) that become unproductive. An <span class="•-Condensed-italic">orderly transition</span> is defined here as a situation in which market players are able to fully anticipate the price adjustments that could arise from the transition. In this case, there would still be losses associated with stranded assets, but it would be possible for market players to spread losses over time and plan ahead. In contrast, a <span class="•-Condensed-italic">disorderly transition</span> is defined here as a situation in which a transition to a low-carbon economy on a 2°C path is achieved (i.e., by about 2040), but the impact of climate policies in terms of reallocation of capital into low-carbon activities and the corresponding adjustment in prices of financial assets (e.g., bonds and equity shares) is large, sudden and not fully anticipated by market players and investors. Note the impact could be unanticipated even if the date of the introduction is known in advance by the market players. There are several reasons why such adjustments could occur. One simple argument is that the political economy of the transition is characterised by forces pulling in different directions, including opposing interests within the industry, and mounting pressure from social awareness of unmitigated climate risks. Politics will have to find a synthesis and the outcome could remain uncertain until it suddenly unravels. Note also that, in order to be relevant for financial risk, the disorderly transition does not need to be a catastrophic scenario in terms of the fabric of markets. It also does not automatically entail systemic risk, as discussed below. Knowledge gaps in this area are related to emerging questions, including: What are, in detail, the transmission channels of physical and transition risk? How to assess the magnitude of the exposure to these risks for financial institutions and ultimately for people’s savings? How do transition risk and opportunities depend on the future scenarios of climate change and climate policies? How to deal with the intrinsic uncertainty around the scenarios? To what extent could an underestimation of climate-related financial risk feed back on the alignment of climate finance flows and hamper the low-carbon transition? Should climate risk be explicitly accounted for in regulatory frameworks for financial institutions, such as Basel III for banks and national frameworks for insurance? What lessons from the 2008 financial crisis are relevant here, regarding moral hazard and the trustworthiness of credit risk ratings? The attention of both practitioners and the scientific community to these questions has grown since the Paris Agreement. In the following we review some of the findings from the literature, but the field is relatively young and many of the questions are still open. <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="ch15.html#footnote-005">12</a> </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>Damages from climate change are expected to escalate dramatically in Europe (<a class="reference-link" href="#Forzieri--2018">Forzieri et al. 2018</a>) and in some EU countries there is already some evidence that banks, anticipating possible losses on the their loan books, lend proportionally less as a consequence.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Assessment of physical risk. </span>There is a literature on estimates of economic losses on physical assets (see Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC in chapter 16 of AR6 WGII).

Further assessments of physical risk for financial assets (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mandel--2020">Mandel 2020</a>), accounting in particular for the propagation of losses through financial networks, estimate global yearly GDP losses at 7.1% (1.13%) in 2080, without adaptation (with adaptation), the former corresponding to a 10-fold increase with respect to the current yearly losses (0.76% of global GDP). Finally, climate physical risk can impact on the value of sovereign <span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">bonds</span> (one of the top asset classes by size), in particular for vulnerable countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Volz--2020">Volz et al. 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Insurance pay-outs for catastrophes have increased significantly over the last 10 years, with dramatic cost spikes in years with multiple major catastrophes (such as in 2018 with hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria).

This suggests that only less than the whole quantity of fossil fuels currently valued (either currently extracted, waiting for extraction as reserves or assets on company balance sheets) can yield economic return if the carbon budget is respected. The devaluation of fossil fuel assets implies financial losses for both the public sector (<a class="section-link" data-title="Facilitating the" href="/chapters/chapter-15#15.6.8">Section 15.6.8</a>) and the private sector (<a class="reference-link" href="#Coffin--2019">Coffin and Grant 2019</a>). Global estimates of potential stranded fossil fuel assets amount to at least 1 trillion, based on ongoing low-carbon technology trends and in the absence of climate policies (cumulated to 2035 with 10% discount rate applied; USD8 trillion without discounting (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mercure--2018a">Mercure et al. 2018a</a>)). With worldwide climate policies to achieve the 2°C target with 75% likelihood, this could increase to over USD4 trillion (until 2035, 10% discount rate; USD12 trillion without discounting). Other estimates indicate USD8–15 trillion (until 2050, 5% discount rate, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bauer--2015">Bauer et al. 2015</a>)) and USD185 trillion (cumulated to year 2115 using combined social and private discount rate (<a class="reference-link" href="#Linquiti--2016">Linquiti and Cogswell 2016</a>)). However the geographical distribution of potential stranded fossil fuel assets (also called ‘unburnable carbon’) is not even across the world due to differences in production costs (<a class="reference-link" href="#McGlade--2015">McGlade and Ekins 2015</a>). In this context, a delayed deployment of climate finance and consequently limited alignment of investment activity with the Paris Agreement tend to strengthen carbon and thus to increase the magnitude of stranded assets.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Assets directly and indirectly exposed to transition risk. </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>In terms of types of assets and economic activities, the focus of estimates of carbon stranded assets tends to be on physical reserves of fossil fuel (e.g., oil fields) and sometimes financial assets of fossil fuel companies (<a class="reference-link" href="#van%20der%20Ploeg--2020">van der Ploeg and Rezai 2020</a>). However, a precondition for a broader analysis of transition risks and opportunities is to go beyond the narrative of stranded assets and to consider a classification of sectors of all the economic activities that could be affected (<a class="reference-link" href="#Monasterolo--2020">Monasterolo 2020</a>). This, in turn depends on their direct or indirect role in the GHG value chain, their level of substitutability with respect to fossil fuel and their role in the policy landscape. Moreover, such a classification needs to be replicable and comparable across portfolios and jurisdictions. One classification that meets these criteria is the Climate Policy Relevant Sectors (CPRS) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Battiston--2017">Battiston et al. 2017</a>) which has been used in several studies by financial supervisors (<a class="reference-link" href="#EIOPA--2018">EIOPA 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#ECB--2019">ECB 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#EBA--2020">EBA 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#ESMA--2020">ESMA 2020</a>). The CPRS classification builds on the international classification of economic activities (ISIC) to map the most granular level (4 digits) into a small set of categories characterised by differing types of risk: fossil fuel (i.e., all activities whose revenues depend mostly and directly on fossil fuel, including concession of reserves and operating industrial plants for extraction and refinement); electricity (affected in terms of input but that can in principle diversify their energy sources); energy intensive (e.g., steel or cement production plants, automotive manufacturing plants), which are affected in terms of energy cost but not in terms of the main input); and transport and buildings (affected in terms of both energy sources and specific policies). All financial assets (e.g., bonds, equity shares, loans) having as issuers or counterparties firms whose revenues depend significantly on the above activities are thus potentially exposed to transition risks and opportunities. Further, investors’ portfolios have to be part of the analysis since changes in financial assets values affect the stability of financial institutions and can thus feed back into the transition dynamics itself (e.g., through cost of debt for firms and through costs for assisting the financial sector). One outstanding challenge for the analysis of investors’ exposure to climate risks is the difficulty of gathering granular and standardised information on the breakdown of non-financial firms’ revenues and CAPEX in terms of low-/high-carbon activities (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">hig</span><span class="•-Condensed-italic">h confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Several financial supervisors have conducted assessments of transition risk for the financial system at the regional level. For instance, the European Central Bank (ECB) reported preliminary estimates of aggregate exposures of financial institutions to CPRS relative to their total debt securities holdings as ranging between 1% for banks to about 9% for investment funds (<a class="reference-link" href="#ECB--2019">ECB 2019</a>). The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) reported aggregate exposures to CPRS of EU insurance companies at about 13% of their total securities holdings (<a class="reference-link" href="#EIOPA--2018">EIOPA 2018</a>). Further analyses on the EU securities holdings indicate that among financial investments in bonds issued by non-financial corporations, EU institutions hold exposures to CPRS ranging between 36.8% for investment funds to 47.7% for insurance corporations; analogous figures for equity holdings range from 36.4% for banks to 43.1% for pension funds (<a class="reference-link" href="#Alessi--2019">Alessi et al. 2019</a>). Another study indicates that losses on EU insurance portfolios of sovereign bonds could reach up to 1%, in conservative scenarios (<a class="reference-link" href="#Battiston--2019">Battiston et al. 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Given the magnitude of the assets that are potentially exposed, reported in the previously cited studies, a delayed or uncoordinated transition risk can have implications for financial stability not only at the level of individual financial institutions, but also at the macro level. The possible systemic nature of climate financial risk has been highlighted on the basis of general equilibrium economic analysis (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stern--2021">Stern and Stiglitz 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Some financial authorities recognise that climate change represents a major source of systemic risk, particularly for banks with portfolios concentrated in certain economic sectors or geographical areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Guindos--2021">de Guindos 2021</a>). Specifically, the concern that central banks would have to act as ‘climate rescuers of last resort’ in a systemic financial crisis stemming from some combination of physical and transition risk has been raised in the financial supervisor community (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bolton--2020">Bolton et al. 2020</a>). The systemic nature of climate risk is reinforced by the possible presence of moral hazard. Indeed, if a sufficient number of financial actors have an incentive to downplay climate-related financial risk, then systemic risk builds up in the financial system, eventually materialising for taxpayers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Climate-Related%20Market%20Risk%20Subcommittee--2020">Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee 2020</a>). While such type of risk may go undetected to standard market indicators for a while, it can materialise with a time delay, similarly to the developments observed in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">These considerations are part of an ongoing discussion on whether the current financial frameworks, including Basel III, should incorporate explicitly climate risk as a systemic risk. In particular, the challenges in quantifying the extent of climate risk, reviewed in this section, especially if risk is systemic, raise the question whether a combination of quantitative and qualitative restrictions on banks’ portfolios could be put in place to limit the build-up of climate risks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Baranovi%C4%87--2021">Baranović et al. 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Endogeneity of risk and</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">multiplicity of scenarios. </span>One fundamental challenge is that climate-related financial risk is endogenous (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>). This means that the perception of the risk changes the risk itself, unlike most contexts of financial risk. Indeed, transition risk depends on whether governments and firms continue on a business-as-usual pathway (i.e., misaligned with the Paris Agreement targets) or engage on a climate mitigation pathway. But the realisation of the transition pathway depends itself on how, collectively, society, including financial investors and supervisors, perceive the risk of taking or not taking the transition scenario. The circularity between perception of risk and realisation of the scenario implies that multiple scenarios are possible, and that which scenario is ultimately realised can depend on policy action. The coordination problem associated also with low-carbon investments opportunities increases the uncertainty. Further, not all low-carbon activities are directly functional to the transition (e.g., investments in pharmaceutical, IT companies, or financial intermediaries), thus not all reallocations of capital lead to the same path.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In this context, probabilities of occurrence of scenarios are difficult to assess and this is important because risks vary widely across the different scenarios. In this context a major challenge is the fat-tail nature of physical risk. One the one hand, forecasts of climate change and its impact on humans and ecosystems imply tail events (<a class="reference-link" href="#Weitzman--2014">Weitzman 2014</a>) and tipping points which cannot be overcome by model consensus (<a class="reference-link" href="#Knutti--2010">Knutti 2010</a>). On the other hand, everything else the same, costs and benefits vary substantially with assumptions on agents’ utility, productivity, and intertemporal discount rate, which ultimately depend on philosophical and ethical considerations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nordhaus--2007">Nordhaus 2007</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Stern--2008">Stern 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pindyck--2013">Pindyck 2013</a>). Thus, more knowledge is needed on the interaction of climate physical and transition risks, the possible reinforcing feedbacks and transmission channels to the economy and to finance. Moreover, models need to account for compound risk, that is, the interaction of climate physical and/or transition risk with other sources of risk such as pandemics, such as COVID-19.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Challenges for climate transition scenarios. </span>The endogeneity of risk and its associated deep uncertainty implies that the standard approach to financial risk, consisting of computing expected values and risk based on historical values of market prices, is not adequate for climate risk (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bolton--2020">Bolton et al. 2020</a>). To address this challenge, a recent stream of work has developed an approach to make use of climate policy scenarios to derive risk measures (e.g., expected shortfall) for financial assets and portfolios, conditioned to scenarios of disorderly transition (<a class="reference-link" href="#Battiston--2017">Battiston et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Monasterolo--2020">Monasterolo and Battiston 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roncoroni--2020">Roncoroni et al. 2020</a>). In particular, climate policy shocks on the output of low-/high-carbon economic activities are calculated based on trajectories of energy technologies as provided by large-scale Integrated Assessment Models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kriegler--2015">Kriegler et al. 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McCollum--2018">McCollum et al. 2018</a>) conditioned to the introduction of specific climate policies over time. This approach allows to conduct climate stress-tests both at the level of financial institutions and at the level of the financial system of a given jurisdiction.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In a similar spirit, recently, the community of financial supervisors in collaboration with the community of climate economics has identified a set of climate policy scenarios, based on large-scale IAM, as candidate scenarios for assessing transition risk (<a class="reference-link" href="#Monasterolo--2020">Monasterolo and Battiston 2020</a>). These scenarios have been used, for instance, in an assessment of transition risk conducted at a national central bank (<a class="reference-link" href="#Allen--2020">Allen et al. 2020</a>). This development is key to mainstreaming the assessment of transition risk among financial institutions, but the following challenges emerge (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>). First, a consensus among financial supervisors and actors on scenarios of transition risk that are too mild could lead to a systematic underestimation of risk. The reason is that the default probability of leveraged financial institutions is sensitive to errors in the estimation of the loss distribution and hence sensitive on the choice of transition scenarios (<a class="reference-link" href="#Battiston--2020">Battiston and </a><a class="reference-link" href="#Monasterolo--2020">Monasterolo 2020</a> ). This in turn could lead to an allocation of capital across low-/high-carbon activities that is insufficient to cater for the investment needs of the low-carbon transition.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Second, IAM do not contain a description of the financial system in terms of actors and instruments and make assumptions on agents’ expectations that could be inconsistent with the nature of a disorderly transition (<a class="reference-link" href="#Espagne--2018">Espagne 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pollitt--2018a">Pollitt and Mercure 2018a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Battiston--2020b">Battiston et al. 2020b</a>). In particular, IAMs solve for least cost pathways to an emissions target in 2100 (AR4 WGIII SPM Box 3), while the financial sector’s time horizon is much shorter and risk is an important factor in investment decisions.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Third, the current modelling frameworks used to develop climate mitigation scenarios, which are based on large-scale IAM, assume that the financial system acts always as an enabler and do not account for the fact that, under some condition (i.e., if there is underestimation of climate transition risk) can also act as a barrier to the transition (<a class="reference-link" href="#Battiston--2020a">Battiston et al. 2020a</a>) because it invests disproportionately more in high-carbon activities.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Macroeconomic implications of the technological transition</span>.

An example is the transport sector, which uses around 50% of oil extracted (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2018">IEA 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Thom%C3%A4--2018">Thomä 2018</a>). A rapid diffusion of EV (and other alternative vehicle types) poses an important risk as it could lead to oil demand peaking far before mid-century (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mercure--2018b">Mercure et al. 2018b</a>; 2021). New technologies and fuel switching in aviation, heavy industry and shipping could further displace liquid fossil fuel demand (<a class="reference-link" href="#IEA--2017">IEA 2017</a>). A rapid diffusion of solar photovoltaic could displace electricity generation based predominantly on coal and gas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sussams--2017">Sussams and Leaton 2017</a>). A rapid diffusion of household and commercial indoor heating and cooling based on electricity could further reduce the demand for oil, coal and gas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Knobloch--2019">Knobloch et al. 2019</a>). Parallels can be made with earlier literature on great waves of innovation, eras of clustered technological innovation and diffusion between which periods of economic, financial and social instability have emerged (Freeman and Louca 2001; <a class="reference-link" href="#Perez--2009">Perez 2009</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Due to the predominantly international nature of fossil fuel markets, assets may be at risk from regulatory and technological changes both domestically and in foreign countries (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</span>).

Finally, many consultancies have stepped forward offering services related to climate risk. However, the methods are typically proprietary, non-transparent, or based primarily on carbon footprinting, which is a necessary but insufficient measure of climate risk. Further, ESG (environmental, social and governance) metrics can be useful but are, alone, inadequate to assess climate risk.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Decision-makers in financial risk management make increasing use of climate policy scenarios, in line with the TCFD guidelines and the recommendations of the NGFS. In order to reduce the number of scenarios to consider, Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs, Chapter 3), have been elaborated to illustrate key features that characterise the possible climate (policy) futures. The following considerations can be useful for scenario end-users who carry out risk analyses on the basis of the scenarios described in Chapter 3. It is possible to associate climate policy scenarios with levels of physical and/or transition risk, but these are not provided with the scenario data themselves.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">On the one hand, each scenario is associated with a warming path, which in turn, on the basis of the results from WGII, implies certain levels of physical risk (AR6 WGII Chapter 16). However, climate impacts are not accounted for in the scenarios. Moreover, levels of risk may vary with the reason for concern and with the speed of the implementation of adaptation. On the other hand, while mitigation can come with transition risk, in the case of lack of coordination among the actors, as discussed earlier in this section, this is not modelled explicitly in the trajectories, since the financial sector is not represented in underlying models. The scientific state of the art in climate-related financial risk offers an analysis that is not yet comprehensive of both the physical and transition risk dimensions in the same quantitative framework. However, decision-makers can follow a mixed approach where they can combine quantitative risk assessment for transition risk with more qualitative risk analysis related to physical risk.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Figure 15.6 represents sequences of events following along a scenario both in terms of physical risk (left) and transition risk (right). Four groups of IMPs (more are considered based on the warming level they lead to in 2100. Current Policies (CurPol) considers climate policies implemented in 2020 with only a gradual strengthening afterwards, leading to above 4°C warming (with respect to pre-industrial levels). Moderate Action (ModAct) explores the impact of implementing the NDCs (pledged mitigation targets) as formulated in 2020 and some further strengthening afterwards, thereby limiting warming to less than 4°C (&gt;50%), but above 3°C (&gt;50%). In these two scenarios, there is no stabilisation of temperature, meaning that further warming occurs after 2100 (and higher risk) even if stabilisation could be eventually achieved. They are referred to as pathways with higher emissions. The warming levels reached along these two scenarios imply physical risk levels that are ‘Moderate’ until 2050 and ‘Very High’ in 2050–2100 (with low levels of adaptation). Noting, that ‘Moderate’ physical risk can mean for some countries (i.e., SIDS) significant and even hardly absorbable consequences (i.e., reaching hard adaptation limits). Transition risk is not relevant for these scenarios, since a transition is not pursued.</p><div class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" id="_idContainer023"><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-6" id="figure-15-6" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Figure_15_6.png"></span></span></p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title---single-column" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Figure 15.6 | Schematic representation of climate scenarios in terms of both physical and transition risk. </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>While the figure does not cover all possible events, it maps out how the combination of stated targets can lead to different paths in terms of risk, depending on implementation progress and policy credibility.

The warming levels along these paths imply ‘Moderate’ physical risk until 2050 and ‘High’ risk in 2050–2100 (with low levels of adaptation). Transition risk can arise along these trajectories from changes in expectations of economic actors about which of the scenarios is about to materialise. These changes imply, in turn, possible large variations in the financial valuation of securities and contracts, with losses on the portfolio of institutional investors and households. High policy credibility is key to avoiding transition risk, by making expectations consistent early on with the scenario. Low credibility can delay the adjustment of expectations by several years, leading either to a late and sudden adjustment. However, if the policy never becomes credible, this changes the scenario since the initial target is not met.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="15.6.2"><h2 class="Headings_•-H2---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="_idGenBNMarker-1">15.6.2</span>Enabling Environments <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-14-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The Paris Agreement recognised for the first time the key role of aligning financial flows to climate goals.

It uses a non-standard macroeconomic framework, with Keynesian features such as financial and labour market rigidities and fiscal and monetary rules (<a class="reference-link" href="#McKibbin--2013">McKibbin and Wilcoxen 2013</a>). First, a global ‘green stimulus’ of about an average of 0.8% of GDP annually in additional fiscal spending between 2020–30 would be required to accelerate the emissions reduction path required for a 1.5°C transition. Second, such a stimulus would also accelerate the global recovery by boosting GDP growth rates by about 0.6% annually during the critical post-COVID period. Third, the optimal tax policy would be to backload the carbon taxes to later in the macroeconomic cycle, both because this would avoid dampening near-term growth while pre-announced carbon tax plans would incentivise long-term private energy transition investment decisions today and provide neutral borrowing. This macroeconomic modelling path thus replicates the ‘green stimulus’ impacts expected in theory (Box 15.6, Figure 1). There are also some other additional features of the modelled proposal: (i) fiscal stimulus – needed in the aftermath of the pandemic – can be an opportunity to boost green and resilient public infrastructure; (ii) green research and development ‘subsidies’ are feasible to boost technological innovations; and (iii) income transfers to lower income groups are necessary to offset negative impacts of rising carbon taxes.</p><p class="Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Substantial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is relatively unique in its public health impacts when combined with the consequences of deep economy-wide shocks (economic downturn, public finances, and debt), are expected to last for decades even in the absence of no significant future recurrence.

There are very obvious and significant challenges. According to <a class="reference-link" href="#Kreft--2017">Kreft and Schäfer (2017)</a>, limitations of insurance schemes include coordination challenges, limited scope, destabilisation due to exit of one or more members as premiums rise and inadequate attention to permanence (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schaeffer--2014">Schaeffer et al. 2014</a>). There are also challenges with risk diversification, replication, and scalability (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>). For example, CCRIF is extending both its membership and diversifying its geographic dimensions into Central America in seeking to lower covariate risk (similar shocks among cohorts such as droughts or floods). Under the SPC portfolio, CCRIF is able to segregate risk across the regions. Risk insurance does not obviate from the need to engage in capacity building to scale-up as well as having process for addressing systemic risk. Currently, risk pools have limited sectoral reach and may cover agriculture but not other important sectors such as fisheries and public utilities. Only recently (July 2019) has CCRIF initiated coverage of fisheries with the development of its Caribbean Oceans and Aquaculture Sustainability Facility (COAST) instrument (<a class="reference-link" href="#CCRIF%20SPC--2019">CCRIF SPC 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#ACT%20Alliance--2020">ACT Alliance 2020</a>). Historically, risk pool mechanisms, like CCRIF and ARC, only cover a small subset of perils, such as tropical cyclones, earthquakes and excess rainfall but do not include other perils such as drought. Since 2016, ARC has increased its scope to cover drought and in 2019 launched ARC Replica, which not only covers drought but offers premiums and coverage to NGOs and the World Food Programme through the START Network and a pastoral drought product for protecting small farmers and ensuring food security. In some regions and countries, there may also be limited access to reinsurance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schaeffer--2014">Schaeffer et al. 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lucas--2015">Lucas 2015</a>). An important down-side of climate risk pooling is that it does not cover the actual cost of damage and losses. Though on the positive side, pay-out may exceed costs, but it may also be less than costs. Hence, the parametric approach is not a panacea and does not preclude having recourse to conventional indemnity insurance, which will cover full damage costs after a climate change event as it involves full on-the-ground assessment of factors such as the necessity and costs of repair versus, say, replacement value of damaged infrastructure. This may be important for governmental and publicly provided services such as schools, hospitals, roads, airports, communications equipment and water supply facilities. Given the growing popularity of parametric insurance and climate risk pooling, there are very ambitious attempts to expand this approach on several fronts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scherer--2017">Scherer 2017</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Schoenmaker--2015">Schoenmaker and Zachmann (2015)</a> have proposed a global climate risk pool to help the most vulnerable countries. The pathway to this includes capacity building in underdeveloped financing sectors of developing countries. They argue that as climate extremes become more normalised, they will wipe out significant parts of the infrastructure and productive capacity of developing countries. This will have knock-on impact on fiscal capacity due to lowered tax revenue and high rebuilding costs. ‘Developing countries’, <a class="reference-link" href="#Schoenmaker--2015">Schoenmaker and Zachmann (2015)</a> argue, ‘cannot insure against such events on a market basis, nor would it be sensible to divert scarce fiscal resources away from infrastructure investment into accumulating a financial buffer for such situations’. In that context, <a class="reference-link" href="#Schoenmaker--2015">Schoenmaker and Zachmann (2015)</a> call for international risk pooling as ‘the only sensible strategy’, especially if it addresses the major gaps in climate risk insurance for poor and vulnerable communities by enhancing demand through ‘smart support instrument’ for premium support such as full or partial premium subsidies and investment in providing risk reduction (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sch%C3%A4fer--2016">Schäfer et al. 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Le%20Quesne--2017">Le Quesne et al. 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#MCII--2018">MCII 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Vyas--2019">Vyas et al. 2019</a>). This, it is argued, may help to smoothen out the limited uptake of regional institutions such as ARC and CCRIF SPC, which are only in three regions of the world (with missing mechanism in South America) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kreft--2017">Kreft and Schäfer 2017</a>). Existing regional mechanisms, while they may perform very well, only cover a portion of climatic hazards and tend to have limited subscribers. For example, across the key four sovereign risk pools (ARC, CRIFSPC, PCRAFI and SEADRIF), though there are 68 countries only one-third or 32% have purchased coverage in 2019 and 46% ‘did not deploy disaster risk financing instruments’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#ACT%20Alliance--2020">ACT Alliance 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Other gaps and challenges flagged by <a class="reference-link" href="#Kreft--2017">Kreft and Schäfer (2017)</a> include limited coverage of the full spectrum of contingency risks experienced by countries, inadequate role of risk management as a standard for all regional pools, though there are some emerging best practices in terms of data provision on weather-related risks, and incentivisation of risk reduction (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>). Here, they recognise the work of Africa Risk Capacity for not only providing the infrastructure to trigger disbursement but for also promoting national risk analysis. Another important gap in the landscape of climate risk pooling is lack of attention to financial institutions’ lending portfolios that are vulnerable to weather shocks. In this regard subsidies as part of innovative financing schemes facilitated by the donor community can encourage the uptake of meso-level climate risk insurance solutions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kreft--2017">Kreft and Schäfer 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In the literature, there are two attempts at systematic evaluation or comprehensive assessment of regional climate risk pools: a comprehensive study by <a class="reference-link" href="#Scherer--2017">Scherer (2017)</a> and FCDO’s ten-year evaluation (2015–2024). Overall, neither of these studies draw adverse conclusions about regional climate risk pooling initiatives/mechanisms. According to Scherer, ‘it appears that insurances work in principle and there is certainly success’ and ‘initial experiences demonstrate regional climate risk insurances works’. The author cited the 28 pay-outs to 16 countries of USD106 millionarguing that it provides cash-starved countries with much needed cash (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scherer--2017">Scherer 2017</a>, p. 4). The FCDO study (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scott--2017">Scott 2017</a>) examines the uptake of ARC and its impact on reducing vulnerability to disasters. It notes that there is scarce literature on disaster risk insurance mechanisms in terms of impacts. In its current sample of 20 countries as of November 2017, four are projected to experience food security crisis (IPC Level 3) but are not signatories to the ARC, which may signal that ARC is not attractive to all food insecure countries and that there is no overwhelming appetite for ARC among poorer countries. Additionally, <a class="reference-link" href="#Panda--2020">Panda and Surminski (2020)</a> research the importance of indicators and frameworks for monitoring the performance and impact of Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) but make no final assessment of any of the regional climate risk pool. However, they propose mechanisms to improve the transparency and accountability of the system. <a class="reference-link" href="#Scherer--2017">Scherer (2017)</a>, <a class="reference-link" href="#Forest--2018">Forest (2018)</a> and <a class="reference-link" href="#Panda--2020">Panda and Surminski (2020)</a> seem to indicate that there is ‘enthusiasm to support and scale-up regional climate risk insurance’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scherer--2017">Scherer 2017</a>, p. 4) Examples of this support include: the Germany Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) has provided USD5.9 million for the World Food Programme (WFP) to protect 1.2 million vulnerable African farmers with climate risk insurance, through ARC Replica, and the G7 InsuResilience Vision 2025, which has committed to ensuring 400–500 million poor persons are covered against disaster shock by pre-arranged finance and insurance mechanism by 2025; some of this will be through ARC (<a class="reference-link" href="#WFP--2020">WFP 2020</a>). Of course, this does not mean that risk pools are without challenges or are not failing on specific sets of metrics. <a class="reference-link" href="#Forest--2018">Forest (2018)</a> flags three failing areas: policy holder and hazard coverage, the cost of premium and risk transfer parameters, and the use of pay-out, which in most cases are up to the government. Here, ARC is flagged among the three regional risk pools, as the only one with contingency plan requirements that can support effective use of pay-outs. Other research exploring climate risk pooling and its impacts flag lack of transparency around pay-out, premium or risk transfer parameters. Ultimately, climate risk pools are not full insurance; they offer only limited coverage.

Nonetheless, the existing global policy framework (entry points, policy priorities, etc.) of climate funds is gradually improving in order to support women’s financial inclusion in both the public and the private dimensions of climate finance/investment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schalatek--2015">Schalatek 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chan--2018">Chan et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schalatek--2020">Schalatek 2020</a>). At the level of public multilateral climate funds, there have been significant improvements in integrating gender equality and women’s empowerment issues in the governance structures, policies, project approval and implementation processes of existing multilateral climate funds such as the UNFCCC’s funds managed by the Global Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund and the World Bank’s CIFs (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schalatek--2015">Schalatek 2015</a>; Williams M., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sellers--2016">Sellers 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#GCF--2017">GCF 2017</a>). But according to a recent evaluation report, the integration of gender into operational policies and programmes is fragmented and there is lack of an ‘adequate, systematic and comprehensive gender equality approach for the allocation and distribution of funds for projects and programmes on the ground’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#GEF%20Independent%20Evaluation%20Office--2017">GEF Independent Evaluation Office 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schalatek--2018">Schalatek 2018</a>). The review found that ‘almost half of the analysed sample of 70 climate projects were judged to be largely gender-blind, and only 5% considered to have successfully mainstreamed gender, including in two Least Developed Countries Fund adaptation projects’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#GEF%20Independent%20Evaluation%20Office--2017">GEF Independent Evaluation Office 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schalatek--2018">Schalatek 2018</a>). While the GCF requires funding proposals to consider gender impact as part of their investment framework, <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="ch15.html#footnote-001">16</a> </span></span> the fund does not have its own funding stream targeted to women’s project on the ground, nor is there as yet an evaluation as to how entities are actually implementing gender action plan in the projects. In the case of the CIFs, as noted by <a class="reference-link" href="#Schalatek--2018">Schalatek (2018)</a>, ‘gender is not included in the operational principles of the Pilot Program on Climate Resilience (PPCR), which funds programmatic adaptation portfolios in a few developing countries, although most pilot countries have included some gender dimensions’. And, ‘gender is not integrated into the operations of the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), which finances large-scale mitigation in large economies and accounts for 70% of the CIFs’ pledged funding portfolio of 8.2 billion USD’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schalatek--2018">Schalatek 2018</a>). However, both the Forest Investment Program (FIP) and the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy in Low-Income Countries Program (SREP) have integrated gender equality as either a co-benefit or core criteria of these programmes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schalatek--2018">Schalatek 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Overall, efforts to promote gender responsive/sensitive climate finance, at national and local levels, both in the public and private dimensions and more specifically in mitigation-oriented sectors such as clean and renewable energy, remain deficient (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>). Recent developments in the capital markets in the areas of social bond are focused around gender bonds – debt instruments targeted to activities and behaviours that are relevant to gender equality and women’s empowerment. These bonds are aligned with Sustainability-linked Bonds as well as Social Bonds Principles of the International Capital Market Association. Issuances of gender-labelled bonds are increasing in the Asia Pacific region (the most comprehensive initiative is the Impact Investment Exchange’s (IIX) multi-country USD150 million Women’s Livelihood Bond <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="ch15.html#footnote-000">17</a> </span></span>) and in Latin America, Colombia, Mexico and Panama each have gender bond issuances). Additionally, a few developing countries, such as Pakistan (May 2021) and Morocco (March 2021) have issued gender bond guidelines for financial market participants.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Linkage to sectoral climate change issues and gender and climate finance. </span> Subsets of actions designed to enhance women’s more formal integration into climate policies, programmes and actions by the global private sector include: investment in clean energy, redirecting funds to support women and vulnerable regions as a component of social and green bonds as well as insurance for climate risk management. In the latter context, insurance providers are arguing that ‘given the fact that women are disproportionately affected by climate change, there could be new finance innovations to address this gap’.(<a class="reference-link" href="#Miles--2018">Miles and Wiedmaier-Pfister 2018</a>). AXA and IFC estimate that the global women’s insurance market has the opportunity to grow to three times its current size, to UDS1.7 trillion by 2030 (AXA Group et al. 2015; GIZ et al. 2017). However, across the board, and in particular with regard to public funds, despite improvements in the substantive gender sensitisation and operational gender responsiveness of multilateral and bilateral climate finance funds operations, current flows of public and climate finance do not seem to be going to women and local communities in significant amounts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chan--2018">Chan et al. 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schalatek--2020">Schalatek 2020</a>). At the same time, evaluations of the effectiveness of climate finance show that equitable flow of climate finance can play an important role in levelling the playing field and in enabling women and men to successfully respond to climate change and to enable the success and sustainability of local response in ensuring effective and sustainable climate strategies that can contribute to the global goals of the Paris Agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#Minniti--2010">Minniti and Naudé 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bird--2013">Bird et al. 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Barrett--2014">Barrett 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Eastin--2018">Eastin 2018</a>).

While climate finance relates historically to the financial support of developed countries to developing countries, the Paris Agreement and its Article 2.1(c) have developed a new narrative that goes much beyond traditional flows and relates to all sectors and actors. Finance flows are consistent when the effects are either neutral with or without positive climate co-benefits to climate objectives; or explicitly targeted to climate benefits in adaptation and/or mitigation result areas. Climate-related financial risk is still massively underestimated by financial institutions, financial decision-makers more generally and also among public sector stakeholders, limiting the sector’s potential of being an enabler of the transition. The private sector has started to recognise climate-related risks and consequently redirect investment flows. Dynamics vary across sectors and regions with the financial sector being an enabler of transitions in only some selected (sub-)sectors and regions. Consistent, credible, timely and forward-looking political leadership remains central to strengthen the financial sector as enabler.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 15.2 | 	What’s the current status of global climate finance and the alignment of global financial flows with the Paris Agreement?"><h2 class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US">FAQ 15.2 | What’s the current status of global climate finance and the alignment of global financial flows with the Paris Agreement?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-24-siblings"><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">There is no agreed definition of climate finance. The term ‘climate finance’ is applied to the financial resources devoted to addressing climate change by all public and private actors from global to local scales, including international financial flows to developing countries to assist them in addressing climate change. Total climate finance includes all financial flows whose expected effect aims to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and/or to enhance resilience to the impacts of current and projected climate change. This includes private and public funds, domestic and international flows and expenditures. Tracking of climate finance flows faces limitations, in particular for national climate finance flows.</p><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">Progress on the alignment of financial flows with low GHG emissions pathways remains slow. Annual global climate finance flows are on an upward trend since the Fifth Assessment Report, according to the Climate Policy Initiative reaching more than USD630 billion in 2019/2020, however, growth has likely slowed down and flows remain significantly below needs. This is driven by barriers within and outside the financial sector. More than 90% of financing is allocated to mitigation activities despite the strong economic rationale of adaptation action. Adjusting for higher estimates on current flows for energy efficiency based on International Energy Agency data, the dominance of mitigation becomes even stronger. Persistently high levels of both public and private fossil-fuel related financing as well as other misaligned flows continue to be of major concern despite recent commitments. Significant progress has been made in the commercial finance sector with regard to the awareness of climate risks resulting from inadequate financial flows and climate action. However, a more consequent investment and policy decision-making that enables a rapid redirection of financial flows is needed. Regulatory support as a catalyser is an essential driver of such redirections. Dynamics across sectors and regions vary, with some being better positioned to close financing gaps and to benefit from an enabling role of finance in the short-term.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 15.3 | 	What defines a financing gap, and where are the critically identified gaps?"><h2 class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading" lang="en-US">FAQ 15.3 | What defines a financing gap, and where are the critically identified gaps?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-25-siblings"><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" lang="en-US">A financing gap is defined as the difference between current flows and average needs to meet the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. Gaps are driven by various barriers inside (short-termism, information gaps, home bias, limited visibility of future pipelines) and outside (e.g., missing pricing of externalities, missing regulatory frameworks) of the financial sector. Current mitigation financing flows come in significantly below average needs across all regions and sectors despite the availability of sufficient capital on a global basis. Globally, yearly climate finance flows have to increase by a factor between three and six to meet average annual needs between 2020 and 2030.</p><p class="Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-US">Gaps are in particular concerning for many developing countries, with COVID-19 exacerbating the macroeconomic outlook and fiscal space for governments. Also, limited institutional capacity represents a key barrier for many developing countries, burdening risk perceptions and access to appropriately priced financing as well as limiting their ability to actively manage the transformation. Existing fundamental inequities in access to finance, as well as its terms and conditions, and countries’ exposure to physical impacts of climate change, overall result in a worsening outlook for a global just transition.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_•-References-heading" lang="en-GB"><span>References</span> </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-9-siblings"><p class="References_•-References-body-copy" id="Abadie--2013" lang="en-GB">Abadie, L.M., I.
