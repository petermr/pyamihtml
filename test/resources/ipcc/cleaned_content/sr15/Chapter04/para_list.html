The pace of these transitions is particularly significant for the supply mix and electrification (Table 4.1). Individual, sectoral studies may show higher rates of change compared to IAMs (Figueres et al., 2017; Rockstr&#246;m et al., 2017; WBCSD, 2017; Kuramochi et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r22" class="bf-reference" data-ref="22"><a href="#fn:r22" rel="footnote">22</a></sup>. These trends and transformation patterns create opportunities and challenges for both mitigation and adaptation (Sections 4.2.1.1 and 4.2.1.2) and have significant implications for the assessment of feasibility and enablers, including governance, institutions, and policy instruments addressed in Sections 4.3 and 4.4.</p>
</li><li><h2>section-4-2-1-1-block-1_p2</h2><p id="section-4-2-1-1-block-1_p2">There is agreement in the literature reviewed by Chapter 2 that staying below 1.5&#176;C would entail significantly greater transformation in terms of energy systems, lifestyles and investments patterns compared to 2&#176;C-consistent pathways. Yet there is&#160;<em>limited evidence</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>low agreement</em>&#160;regarding the magnitudes and costs of the investments (Sections 2.5.1, 2.5.2 and 4.4.5). Based on the IAM literature reviewed in Chapter 2, climate policies in line with limiting warming to 1.5&#176;C would require a marked upscaling of supply-side energy system investments between now and mid-century, reaching levels of between 1.6&#8211;3.8 trillion USD yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;globally with an average of about 3.5 trillion USD yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;over 2016&#8211;2050 (see Figure 2.27). This can be compared to an average of about 3.0 trillion USD yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;over the same period for 2&#176;C-consistent pathways (also in Figure 2.27).</p>
</li><li><h2>section-4-2-1-1-block-1_p3</h2><p id="section-4-2-1-1-block-1_p3">Not only the level of investment but also the type and speed of sectoral transformation would be impacted by the transitions associated with 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways. IAM literature projects that investments in low-emission energy would overtake fossil fuel investments globally by 2025 in 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2). The projected low-emission investments in electricity generation allocations over the period 2016&#8211;2050 are: solar (0.09&#8211;1.0 trillion USD yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), wind (0.1&#8211;0.35 trillion USD yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), nuclear (0.1&#8211;0.25 trillion USD yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), and transmission, distribution, and storage (0.3&#8211;1.3 trillion USD yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). In contrast, investments in fossil fuel extraction and unabated fossil electricity generation along a 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathway are projected to drop by 0.3&#8211;0.85 trillion USD yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;over the period 2016&#8211;2050, with investments in unabated coal generation projected to halt by 2030 in most 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2). Estimates of investments in other infrastructure are currently unavailable, but they could be considerably larger in volume than solely those in the energy sector (Section 4.4.5).</p>
</li><li><h2>section-4-2-1-1-block-1_p5</h2><p id="section-4-2-1-1-block-1_p5">The 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways raise multiple challenges for effective policy design and responses to address the scale, speed, and pace of mitigation technology, finance and capacity building needs. These policies and responses would also need to deal with their distributional implications while addressing adaptation to residual climate impacts (see Chapter&#160;5). The available literature indicates that 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways would require robust, stringent and urgent transformative policy interventions targeting the decarbonization of energy supply, electrification, fuel switching, energy efficiency, land-use change, and lifestyles (Chapter 2, Section 2.5, 4.4.2, 4.4.3). Examples of effective approaches to integrate mitigation with adaptation in the context of sustainable development and to deal with distributional implications proposed in the literature include the utilization of dynamic adaptive policy pathways (Haasnoot et al., 2013; Mathy et al., 2016)<sup id="fnref:r29" class="bf-reference" data-ref="29"><a href="#fn:r29" rel="footnote">29</a></sup> and transdisciplinary knowledge systems (Bendito and Barrios, 2016)<sup id="fnref:r30" class="bf-reference" data-ref="30"><a href="#fn:r30" rel="footnote">30</a></sup>.</p>

Projections of the magnitudes of global economic costs associated with 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways and their sectoral and regional distributions from the currently assessed literature are scant, yet suggestive. For example, IAM simulations assessed in Chapter 2 project (with a probability greater than 50%) that marginal abatement costs, typically represented in IAMs through a carbon price, would increase by about 3&#8211;4 times by 2050 under a 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathway compared to a 2&#176;C-consistent pathway (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2, Figure 2.26). Managing these costs and distributional effects would require an approach that takes account of unintended cross-sector, cross-nation, and cross-policy trade-offs during the transition (Droste et al., 2016; Stiglitz et al., <span id="errata1"><a title="Errata: Remove reference Politt, 2018" href="/sr15/about/error-protocol/#errata1">Pollitt, 2018;</a></span> 2017; Sands, 2018; Siegmeier et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r31" class="bf-reference" data-ref="31"><a href="#fn:r31" rel="footnote">31</a></sup>.</p>

Nonetheless, literature on potential synergies and trade-offs between 1.5&#176;C-consistent mitigation pathways and sustainable development dimensions is emerging (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.3, Chapter 5, Section 5.4). Areas of potential trade-offs include reduction in final energy demand in relation to SDG 7 (the universal clean energy access goal) and increase of biomass production in relation to land use, water resources, food production, biodiversity and air quality (Chapter 2, Sections 2.4.3, 2.5.3). Strengthening the institutional and policy responses to deal with these challenges is discussed in Section 4.4 together with the linkage between disruptive changes in the energy sector and structural changes in other infrastructure (transport, building, water and telecommunication) sectors. A more in-depth assessment of the complexity and interfaces between 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways and sustainable development is presented in Chapter 5.</p>

This implies that investors will be able to make the right choices under perfect foresight and that domestic and international compensatory transfers offset the adverse distributional impacts of higher energy prices and their consequences on economic activity. In the absence of such transfers, carbon prices would have to be differentiated by jurisdiction (Chichilnisky and Heal, 2000; Sheeran, 2006; B&#246;hringer et al., 2009; B&#246;hringer and Alexeeva-Talebi, 2013)<sup id="fnref:r1362" class="bf-reference" data-ref="1362"><a href="#fn:r1362" rel="footnote">1362</a></sup>.

The substitution by carbon taxes of taxes that cause distortions on the economy can counteract the regressive effect of higher energy prices.
