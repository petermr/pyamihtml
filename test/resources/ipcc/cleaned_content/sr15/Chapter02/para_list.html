Minimization of mitigation expenditures, but not climate-related damages or sustainable development impacts, is often the basis for these pathways to the desired climate target (see Cross-Chapter Box&#160;5 in this chapter for additional discussion). However, there are interactions between mitigation and multiple other sustainable development goals (see Sections&#160;1.1 and 5.4) that provide both challenges and opportunities for climate action. Hence there are substantial efforts to evaluate the effects of the various mitigation pathways on sustainable development, focusing in particular on aspects for which integrated assessment models (IAMs) provide relevant information (e.g., land-use changes and biodiversity, food security, and air quality). More broadly, there are efforts to incorporate climate change mitigation as one of multiple objectives that, in general, reflect societal concerns more completely and could potentially provide benefits at lower costs than simultaneous single-objective policies (e.g., Clarke et al., 2014)<sup id="fnref:r1" class="bf-reference" data-ref="1"><a href="#fn:r1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. For example, with carefully selected policies, universal energy access can be achieved while simultaneously reducing air pollution and mitigating climate change (McCollum et al., 2011; Riahi et al., 2012; IEA, 2017d)<sup id="fnref:r2" class="bf-reference" data-ref="2"><a href="#fn:r2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This chapter thus presents both the pathways and an initial discussion of their context within sustainable development objectives (Section&#160;2.5), with the latter, along with equity and ethical issues, discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.</p>

In this assessment, the following classes of 1.5&#176;C- and 2&#176;C-consistent scenarios are of particular interest to the topics addressed in this chapter: (i) scenarios with the same climate target over the 21st century but varying socio-economic assumptions (Sections 2.3 and 2.4), (ii) pairs of scenarios with similar socio-economic assumptions but with forcing targets aimed at 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C (Section 2.3), and (iii) scenarios that follow the Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs<sup id="fnref:2" class="bf-footnote" data-fn="2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>&#160;until 2030 with much more stringent mitigation action thereafter (Section 2.3.5).</p>

However, they cannot be assessed as &#8216;requirements&#8217; for 1.5&#176;C, unless a targeted analysis is available that specifically asked whether there could be other 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways without the characteristics in question. AR5 already assessed such targeted analyses, for example, asking which technologies are important in order to keep open the possibility of limiting warming to 2&#176;C (Clarke et al., 2014)<sup id="fnref:r3" class="bf-reference" data-ref="3"><a href="#fn:r3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.

Earlier scenario studies have shown, however, that deeper emissions reductions in the near term hedge against the uncertainty of both climate response and future technology availability (Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b; Clarke et al., 2014)<sup id="fnref:r5" class="bf-reference" data-ref="5"><a href="#fn:r5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. Not knowing what adaptations might be put in place in the future, and due to limited studies, this chapter examines prospective rather than iteratively adaptive mitigation pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1).

Nevertheless, the overall uncertainty assessment is based on results from both models, which are considered in the context of the latest radiative forcing estimates and observed temperatures (Etminan et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r13" class="bf-reference" data-ref="13"><a href="#fn:r13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> (Section&#160;2.2 and Supplementary Material&#160;2.SM.1.1). The comparison of these lines of evidence shows <em>high agreement</em> in the relative temperature response of pathways, with <em>medium agreement</em> on the precise absolute magnitude of warming, introducing a level of imprecision in these attributes.

The IAMs used in this chapter have limited to no coverage of climate impacts. They typically use GHG pricing mechanisms to induce emissions reductions and associated changes in energy and land uses consistent with the imposed climate goal. The scenarios generated by these models are defined by the choice of climate goals and assumptions about near-term climate policy developments.

Within a specific category and between models, there remains a large degree of variance. Most pathways exhibit a temperature overshoot which has been highlighted in several studies focusing on stringent mitigation pathways (Huntingford and Lowe, 2007; Wigley et al., 2007; Nohara et al., 2015; Rogelj et al., 2015d; Zickfeld and Herrington, 2015; Schleussner et al., 2016; Xu and Ramanathan, 2017)<sup id="fnref:r40" class="bf-reference" data-ref="40"><a href="#fn:r40" rel="footnote">40</a></sup>. Only very few of the scenarios collected in the database for this report hold the average future warming projected by MAGICC below 1.5&#176;C during the entire 21st century (Table 2.1, Figure 2.1). Most 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways available in the database overshoot 1.5&#176;C around mid-century before peaking and then reducing temperatures so as to return below that level in 2100. However, because of numerous geophysical uncertainties and model dependencies (Section 2.2.1.1, Supplementary Material&#160;2.SM.1.1), absolute temperature characteristics of the various pathway categories are more difficult to distinguish than relative features (Figure 2.1, Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1), and actual probabilities of overshoot are imprecise. However, all lines of evidence available for temperature projections indicate a probability greater than 50% of overshooting 1.5&#176;C by mid-century in all but the most stringent pathways currently available (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1, 2.SM.1.4).</p>
</li><li><h2>section-2-2-1-block-1_p3</h2><p id="section-2-2-1-block-1_p3">Most 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways exhibit a peak in temperature by mid-century whereas 2&#176;C-consistent pathways generally peak after 2050 (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.4). The peak in median temperature in the various pathway categories occurs about ten years before reaching net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to strongly reduced annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and deep reductions in CH<sub>4 </sub>emissions (Section 2.3.3). The two reduced-complexity climate models used in this assessment suggest that virtually all available 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways peak and then decline global mean temperature, but with varying rates of temperature decline after the peak (Figure 2.1). The estimated decadal rates of temperature change by the end of the century are smaller than the amplitude of the climate variability as assessed in AR5 (1 standard deviation of about &#177;0.1&#176;C), which hence complicates the detection of a global peak and decline of warming in observations on time scales of one to two decades (Bindoff et al., 2013)<sup id="fnref:r41" class="bf-reference" data-ref="41"><a href="#fn:r41" rel="footnote">41</a></sup>.

This uncertainty ultimately affects the assessed temperature outcomes for pathway classes used in this chapter (Section 2.1) and also affects the carbon budget (Section 2.2.2). Figure 2.2 highlights the important role of methane emissions reduction in this scenario, in agreement with the recent literature focussing on stringent mitigation pathways (Shindell et al., 2012; Rogelj et al., 2014b, 2015a; Stohl et al., 2015; Collins et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r45" class="bf-reference" data-ref="45"><a href="#fn:r45" rel="footnote">45</a></sup>.</p>

AR5 SYR Figures SPM.10 and 2.3 already illustrated the discrepancy between models and observations, but did not apply this as a correction to the carbon budget because they were being used to illustrate the overall linear relationship between warming and cumulative carbon emissions in the CMIP5 models since 1870, and were not specifically designed to quantify residual carbon budgets relative to the present for ambitious temperature goals. The AR5 SYR estimate was also dependent on a subset of Earth system models illustrated in Figure 2.3 of this report. Although, as outlined below and in Table 2.2, considerably uncertainties remain, there is <em>high agreement </em>across various lines of evidence assessed in this report that the remaining carbon budget for 1.5&#176;C or 2&#176;C would be larger than the estimates at the time of the AR5.

Accounting for such feedbacks would make the carbon budget more applicable for 2100 temperature targets, but would also increase uncertainty (Table 2.2 and see below). Excluding such feedbacks, the assessed range for the remaining carbon budget is estimated to be 840, 580, and 420 GtCO<sub>2</sub> for the 33rd, 50th and, 67th percentile of TCRE, respectively, with a median non-CO<sub>2</sub> warming contribution and starting from 1 January 2018 onward.

The AR5 used 15 Earth System Models (ESM) and 5 Earth-system Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC) to derive an estimate of the remaining carbon budget. Their approach hence made implicit assumptions about the level of warming to date, the future contribution of non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and the temperature response to CO<sub>2</sub> (TCRE). In this report, each of these aspects are considered explicitly. When estimating global warming until the 2006&#8211;2015 reference period as a blend of near-surface air temperature over land and sea-ice regions, and sea-surface temperature over open ocean, by averaging the four global mean surface temperature time series listed in Chapter 1 Section 1.2.1, the global warming would amount to 0.87&#176;C &#177;0.1&#176;C. Using the latter estimate of historical warming and projecting global warming using global near-surface air temperatures from model projections leads to remaining carbon budgets for limiting global warming to 1.5&#176;C of 1080, 770, and 570 GtCO<sub>2</sub> for the 33rd, 50th, and 67th percentile of TCRE, respectively. Note that future research and ongoing observations over the next years will provide a better indication as to how the 2006&#8211;2015 base period compares with the long-term trends and might affect the budget estimates. Similarly, improved understanding in Earth system feedbacks would result in a better quantification of their impacts on remaining carbon budgets for 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C.</p>

This arises from a weakening of aerosol cooling and continued emissions of non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHGs (Sections 2.2.1, 2.3.3). This non-CO<sub>2</sub> contribution at the time of net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions varies by about &#177;0.1&#176;C across scenarios, resulting in a carbon budget uncertainty of about &#177;250 GtCO<sub>2</sub>, and takes into account marked reductions in methane emissions (Section 2.3.3). If these reductions are not achieved, remaining carbon budgets are further reduced. Uncertainties in the non-CO<sub>2</sub> forcing and temperature response are asymmetric and can influence the remaining carbon budget by &#8722;400 to +200 GtCO<sub>2</sub>, with the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing being the largest contributing factor (Table&#160;2.2). The MAGICC and FAIR models in their respective parameter setups and model versions used to assess the non-CO<sub>2</sub> warming contribution give noticeable different non-CO<sub>2</sub> effective radiative forcing and warming for the same scenarios while both being within plausible ranges of future response (Figure 2.2 and Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1, 2.SM.1.2). For this assessment, it is premature to assess the accuracy of their results, so it is assumed that both are equally representative of possible futures. Their non-CO<sub>2</sub> warming estimates are therefore averaged for the carbon budget assessment and their differences used to guide the uncertainty assessment of the role of non-CO<sub>2</sub> forcers. Nevertheless, the findings are robust enough to give <em>high confidence</em> that the changing emissions of non-CO<sub>2</sub> forcers (particularly the reduction in cooling aerosol precursors) cause additional near-term warming and reduce the remaining carbon budget compared to the CO<sub>2</sub>-only budget.</p>

The configuration of carbon-neutral energy systems projected in mitigation pathways can vary widely, but they all share a substantial reliance on bioenergy under the assumption of effective land-use emissions control. There are other configurations with less reliance on bioenergy that are not yet comprehensively covered by global mitigation pathway modelling. One approach is to dramatically reduce and electrify energy demand for transportation and manufacturing to levels that make residual non-electric fuel use negligible or replaceable by limited amounts of electrolytic hydrogen.

Mitigation policies can either be applied immediately in scenarios or follow staged or delayed approaches. Policies can span many sectors (e.g., economy-wide carbon pricing), or policies can be applicable to specific sectors only (like the energy sector) with other sectors (e.g., the agricultural or the land-use sector) treated differently. These variations can have an important impact on the ability of models to generate scenarios compatible with stringent climate targets like 1.5&#176;C (Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b; Bertram et al., 2015b; Kriegler et al., 2018a; Michaelowa et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r181" class="bf-reference" data-ref="181"><a href="#fn:r181" rel="footnote">181</a></sup>. In the scenario ensemble available to this assessment, several variations of near-term mitigation policy implementation can be found: immediate and cross-sectoral global cooperation from 2020 onward towards a global climate objective, a phase-in of globally coordinated mitigation policy from 2020 to 2040, and a more short-term oriented and regionally diverse global mitigation policy, following NDCs until 2030 (Kriegler et al., 2018a; Luderer et al., 2018; McCollum et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018; Strefler et al., 2018b)<sup id="fnref:r182" class="bf-reference" data-ref="182"><a href="#fn:r182" rel="footnote">182</a></sup>.

This is achieved by broad transformations in the energy; industry; transport; buildings; and agriculture, forestry and other land-use (AFOLU) sectors (Section 2.4) (Bauer et al., 2018; Grubler et al., 2018; Holz et al., 2018b; Kriegler et al., 2018b; Liu et al., 2018; Luderer et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r186" class="bf-reference" data-ref="186"><a href="#fn:r186" rel="footnote">186</a></sup>. Here we assess 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways with and without overshoot during the 21st century. One study also explores pathways overshooting 1.5&#176;C for longer than the 21st century (Akimoto et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r187" class="bf-reference" data-ref="187"><a href="#fn:r187" rel="footnote">187</a></sup>, but these are not considered 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways in this report (Chapter 1, Section 1.1.3). This subsection summarizes robust and varying properties of 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways regarding system transformations, emission reductions and overshoot. It aims to provide an introduction to the detailed assessment of the emissions evolution (Section 2.3.3), CDR deployment (Section 2.3.4), energy (Section 2.4.1, 2.4.2), industry (2.4.3.1), buildings (2.4.3.2), transport (2.4.3.3) and land-use transformations (Section 2.4.4) in 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways. Throughout Sections 2.3 and 2.4, pathway properties are highlighted with four 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathway archetypes (LED, S1, S2, S5; referred to as P1, P2, P3, and P4 in the Summary for Policymakers) covering a wide range of different socio-economic and technology assumptions (Figure 2.5, Section 2.3.1).</p>
</li><li><h2>section-2-3-2-1-block-1_p1</h2><p id="section-2-3-2-1-block-1_p1">Be it for the energy, transport, buildings, industry, or AFOLU sector, the literature shows that multiple options and choices are available in each of these sectors to pursue stringent emissions reductions (Section 2.3.1.2, Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2, Chapter 4, Section 4.3). Because the overall emissions total under a pathway is limited by a geophysical carbon budget (Section 2.2.2), choices in one sector affect the efforts that are required from others (Clarke et al., 2014)<sup id="fnref:r188" class="bf-reference" data-ref="188"><a href="#fn:r188" rel="footnote">188</a></sup>. A robust feature of 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways, as highlighted by the set of pathway archetypes in Figure 2.5, is a virtually full decarbonization of the power sector around mid-century, a feature shared with 2&#176;C-consistent pathways. The additional emissions reductions in 1.5&#176;C-consistent compared to 2&#176;C-consistent pathways come predominantly from the transport and industry sectors (Luderer et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r189" class="bf-reference" data-ref="189"><a href="#fn:r189" rel="footnote">189</a></sup>. Emissions can be apportioned differently across sectors, for example, by focussing on reducing the overall amount of CO<sub>2</sub> produced in the energy end-use sectors, and using limited contributions of CDR by the AFOLU sector (afforestation and reforestation, S1 and LED pathways in Figure 2.5) (Grubler et al., 2018; Holz et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r190" class="bf-reference" data-ref="190"><a href="#fn:r190" rel="footnote">190</a></sup>, or by being more lenient about the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that continues to be produced in the above-mentioned end-use sectors (both by 2030 and mid-century) and strongly relying on technological CDR options like BECCS (S2 and S5 pathways in Figure 2.5) (Luderer et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r191" class="bf-reference" data-ref="191"><a href="#fn:r191" rel="footnote">191</a></sup>. Major drivers of these differences are assumptions about energy and food demand and the stringency of near-term climate policy (see the difference between early action in the scenarios S1, LED and more moderate action until 2030 in the scenarios S2, S5). Furthermore, the carbon budget in each of these pathways depends also on the non-CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation measures implemented in each of them, particularly for agricultural emissions (Sections 2.2.2, 2.3.3) (Gernaat et al., 2015)<sup id="fnref:r192" class="bf-reference" data-ref="192"><a href="#fn:r192" rel="footnote">192</a></sup>. Those pathways differ not only in terms of their deployment of mitigation and CDR measures (Sections 2.3.4 and 2.4), but also in terms of the resulting temperature overshoot (Figure 2.1). Furthermore, they have very different implications for the achievement of sustainable development objectives, as further discussed in Section 2.5.3.</p>

Based on the current state of knowledge, exceeding this remaining carbon budget at some point in time would give a one-in-three (one-in-two) chance that the 1.5&#176;C limit is overshot (Table 2.2). For comparison, around 290 &#177; 20 (1 standard deviation range) GtCO<sub>2</sub> have been emitted in the years 2011&#8211;2017, with annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2017 around 42 &#177; 3 GtCO<sub>2 </sub>yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (Jackson et al., 2017; Le Qu&#233;r&#233; et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r193" class="bf-reference" data-ref="193"><a href="#fn:r193" rel="footnote">193</a></sup>.

Whether such pathways will be able to limit warming to 1.5&#176;C without overshoot will depend on whether cumulative net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over the 21st century can be kept below the remaining carbon budget at any time. Net global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are derived from the gross amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that humans annually emit into the atmosphere reduced by the amount of anthropogenic CDR in each year. New research has looked more closely at the amount and the drivers of gross CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and industrial processes (FFI) in deep mitigation pathways (Luderer et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r199" class="bf-reference" data-ref="199"><a href="#fn:r199" rel="footnote">199</a></sup>, and found that the larger part of remaining CO<sub>2</sub> emissions come from direct fossil-fuel use in the transport and industry sectors, while residual energy supply sector emissions (mostly from the power sector) are limited by a rapid approach to net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions until mid-century. The 1.5&#176;C pathways with no or limited (&lt;0.1&#176;C) overshoot that were reported in the scenario database project remaining FFI CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 610&#8211;1260 GtCO<sub>2</sub> over the period 2018&#8211;2100 (5th&#8211;95th percentile range; median: 880 GtCO<sub>2</sub>).

By exploring these options to their extremes, they found a lowest value of 500 GtCO<sub>2</sub> (2018&#8211;2100) gross fossil-fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the hypothetical case of aligning the strongest assumptions for all four mitigation options. The two lines of evidence and the fact that available 1.5&#176;C pathways cover a wide range of assumptions (Section 2.3.1) give a robust indication of a lower limit of about 500 GtCO<sub>2</sub> remaining fossil-fuel and industry CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the 21st century.</p>

In many of the 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways, AFOLU CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reach zero at or before mid-century and then turn to negative values (Table 2.4). This means human changes to the land lead to atmospheric carbon being stored in plants and soils. This needs to be distinguished from the natural CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by land, which is not accounted for in the anthropogenic AFOLU CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reported in the pathways. Given the difference in estimating the &#8216;anthropogenic&#8217; sink between countries and the global integrated assessment and carbon modelling community (Grassi et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r201" class="bf-reference" data-ref="201"><a href="#fn:r201" rel="footnote">201</a></sup>, the AFOLU CO<sub>2</sub> estimates included here are not necessarily directly comparable with countries&#8217; estimates at global level. The cumulated amount of AFOLU CO<sub>2</sub> emissions until the time they reach zero combine with the fossil-fuel and industry CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to give a total amount of gross emissions of 650&#8211;1270 GtCO<sub>2</sub> for the period 2018&#8211;2100 (5th&#8211;95th percentile; median 950 GtCO<sub>2</sub>) in 1.5&#176;C pathways with no or limited overshoot. The lower end of the range is close to what emerges from a scenario of transformative change that halves CO<sub>2</sub> emissions every decade from 2020 to 2050 (Rockstr&#246;m et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r202" class="bf-reference" data-ref="202"><a href="#fn:r202" rel="footnote">202</a></sup>. All these estimates are above the remaining carbon budget for a one-in-two chance of limiting warming below 1.5&#176;C without overshoot, including the low end of the hypothetical sensitivity analysis of Kriegler et al. (2018b)<sup id="fnref:r203" class="bf-reference" data-ref="203"><a href="#fn:r203" rel="footnote">203</a></sup>, who assumes 75 Gt AFOLU CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions adding to a total of 575 GtCO<sub>2</sub> gross CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. As almost no cases have been identified that keep gross CO<sub>2</sub> emissions within the remaining carbon budget for a one-in-two chance of limiting warming to 1.5&#176;C, and based on current understanding of the geophysical response and its uncertainties, the available evidence indicates that avoiding overshoot of 1.5&#176;C will require some type of CDR in a broad sense, e.g., via net negative AFOLU CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (<em>medium confidence</em>).

</li><li><h2>section-2-3-2-2-block-1_p5</h2><p id="section-2-3-2-2-block-1_p5">Net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can fall below gross CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, if CDR is brought into the mix. Studies have looked at mitigation and CDR in combination to identify strategies for limiting warming to 1.5&#176;C (Sanderson et al., 2016; Ricke et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r204" class="bf-reference" data-ref="204"><a href="#fn:r204" rel="footnote">204</a></sup>. CDR, which may include net negative AFOLU CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, is deployed by all 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways available to this assessment, but the scale of deployment and choice of CDR measures varies widely (Section 2.3.4). Furthermore, no CDR technology has been deployed at scale yet, and all come with concerns about their potential (Fuss et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r205" class="bf-reference" data-ref="205"><a href="#fn:r205" rel="footnote">205</a></sup>, feasibility (Nemet et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r206" class="bf-reference" data-ref="206"><a href="#fn:r206" rel="footnote">206</a></sup> and/or sustainability (Smith et al., 2015; Fuss et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r207" class="bf-reference" data-ref="207"><a href="#fn:r207" rel="footnote">207</a></sup> (see Sections 2.3.4, 4.3.2 and 4.3.7 and Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3 for further discussion). CDR can have two very different functions in 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways. If deployed in the first half of the century, before net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are reached, it neutralizes some of the remaining CO<sub>2</sub> emissions year by year and thus slows the accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. In this first function it can be used to remain within the carbon budget and avoid overshoot. If CDR is deployed in the second half of the century after carbon neutrality has been established, it can still be used to neutralize some residual emissions from other sectors, but also to create net negative emissions that actively draw down the cumulative amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to return below a 1.5&#176;C warming level. In the second function, CDR enables temporary overshoot. The literature points to strong limitations to upscaling CDR (limiting its first abovementioned function) and to sustainability constraints (limiting both abovementioned functions) (Fuss et al., 2018; Minx et al., 2018; Nemet et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r208" class="bf-reference" data-ref="208"><a href="#fn:r208" rel="footnote">208</a></sup>. Large uncertainty hence exists about what amount of CDR could actually be available before mid-century. Kriegler et al. (2018b)<sup id="fnref:r209" class="bf-reference" data-ref="209"><a href="#fn:r209" rel="footnote">209</a></sup> explore a case limiting CDR to 100 GtCO<sub>2</sub> until 2050, and the 1.5&#176;C pathways with no or limited overshoot available in the report&#8217;s database project 40&#8211;260 GtCO<sub>2</sub> CDR until the point of carbon neutrality (5th to 95th percentile; median 110 GtCO<sub>2</sub>). Because gross CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in most cases exceed the remaining carbon budget by several hundred GtCO<sub>2</sub> and given the limits to CDR deployment until 2050, most of the 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways available to this assessment are overshoot pathways. However, the scenario database also contains nine non-overshoot pathways that remain below 1.5&#176;C throughout the 21st century (Table 2.1).</p>
</li><li><h2>section-2-3-3-block-1_p2</h2><p id="section-2-3-3-block-1_p2">Estimates of aggregated GHG emissions in line with specific policy choices are often compared to near-term benchmark values from mitigation pathways to explore their consistency with long-term climate goals (Clarke et al., 2014; UNEP, 2016, 2017; UNFCCC, 2016)<sup id="fnref:r210" class="bf-reference" data-ref="210"><a href="#fn:r210" rel="footnote">210</a></sup>. Benchmark emissions or estimates of peak years derived from IAMs provide guidelines or milestones that are consistent with achieving a given temperature level. While they do not set mitigation requirements in a strict sense, exceeding these levels in a given year almost invariably increases the mitigation challenges afterwards by increasing the rates of change and increasing the reliance on speculative technologies, including the possibility that its implementation becomes unachievable (see Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1 for a discussion of feasibility concepts) (Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b; Clarke et al., 2014; Fawcett et al., 2015; Riahi et al., 2015; Kriegler et al., 2018a)<sup id="fnref:r211" class="bf-reference" data-ref="211"><a href="#fn:r211" rel="footnote">211</a></sup>. These trade-offs are particularly pronounced in 1.5&#176;C pathways and are discussed in Section&#160;2.3.5.

</li><li><h2>section-2-3-3-block-1_p3</h2><p id="section-2-3-3-block-1_p3">Appropriate benchmark values of aggregated GHG emissions depend on a variety of factors. First and foremost, they are determined by the desired likelihood to keep warming below 1.5&#176;C and the extent to which projected temporary overshoot is to be avoided (Sections 2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.3.5). For instance, median aggregated 2030 GHG emissions are about 10 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> lower in 1.5&#176;C-low-OS compared to 1.5&#176;C-high-OS pathways, with respective interquartile ranges of 26&#8211;31 and 36&#8211;49 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (Table 2.4). These ranges correspond to about 25&#8211;30 and 35&#8211;48 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in 2030, respectively, when aggregated with 100-year Global Warming Potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report. The limited evidence available for pathways aiming to limit warming below 1.5&#176;C without overshoot or with limited amounts of CDR (Grubler et al., 2018; Holz et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r212" class="bf-reference" data-ref="212"><a href="#fn:r212" rel="footnote">212</a></sup> indicates that under these conditions consistent emissions in 2030 would fall at the lower end and below the above mentioned ranges. Due to the small number of 1.5&#176;C pathways with no overshoot in the report&#8217;s database (Table 2.4) and the potential for a downward bias in the selection of underlying scenario assumptions, the headline range for 1.5&#176;C pathways with no or limited overshoot is also assessed to be of the order of 25&#8211;30 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Ranges for the 1.5&#176;C-low-OS and Lower-2&#176;C classes only overlap outside their interquartile ranges, highlighting the more accelerated reductions in 1.5&#176;C-consistent compared to 2&#176;C-consistent pathways.</p>
</li><li><h2>section-2-3-3-block-1_p4</h2><p id="section-2-3-3-block-1_p4">Appropriate emissions benchmark values also depend on the acceptable or desired portfolio of mitigation measures, representing clearly identified trade-offs and choices (Sections 2.3.4, 2.4, and 2.5.3) (Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Clarke et al., 2014; Krey et al., 2014a; Strefler et al., 2018b)<sup id="fnref:r213" class="bf-reference" data-ref="213"><a href="#fn:r213" rel="footnote">213</a></sup>. For example, lower 2030 GHG emissions correlate with a lower dependence on the future availability and desirability of CDR (Strefler et al., 2018b)<sup id="fnref:r214" class="bf-reference" data-ref="214"><a href="#fn:r214" rel="footnote">214</a></sup>. On the other hand, pathways that assume or anticipate only limited deployment of CDR during the 21st century imply lower emissions benchmarks over the coming decades, which are achieved in models through further reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the coming decades. The pathway archetypes used in the chapter illustrate this further (Figure 2.6). Under middle-of-the-road assumptions of technological and socioeconomic development, pathway <em>S2</em> suggests emission benchmarks of 34, 12 and &#8722;8 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. In contrast, a pathway that further limits overshoot and aims at eliminating the reliance on negative emissions technologies like BECCS as well as CCS (here labelled as the <em>LED</em> pathway) shows deeper emissions reductions in 2030 to limit the cumulative amount of CO<sub>2</sub> until net zero global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (carbon neutrality). The <em>LED</em> pathway here suggests emission benchmarks of 25, 9 and 2 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. However, a pathway that allows and plans for the successful large-scale deployment of BECCS by and beyond 2050 (<em>S5</em>) shows a shift in the opposite direction. The variation within and between the abovementioned ranges of 2030 GHG benchmarks hence depends strongly on societal choices and preferences related to the acceptability and availability of certain technologies.</p>
</li><li><h2>section-2-3-3-block-1_p6</h2><p id="section-2-3-3-block-1_p6">Kyoto-GHG emission reductions are achieved by reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> and non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHGs. The AR5 identified two primary factors that influence the depth and timing of reductions in non-CO<sub>2</sub> Kyoto-GHG emissions: (i) the abatement potential and costs of reducing the emissions of these gases and (ii) the strategies that allow making trade-offs between them (Clarke et al., 2014)<sup id="fnref:r215" class="bf-reference" data-ref="215"><a href="#fn:r215" rel="footnote">215</a></sup>. Many studies indicate low-cost, near-term mitigation options in some sectors for non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases compared to supply-side measures for CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation (Clarke et al., 2014)<sup id="fnref:r216" class="bf-reference" data-ref="216"><a href="#fn:r216" rel="footnote">216</a></sup>. A large share of this potential is hence already exploited in mitigation pathways in line with 2&#176;C. At the same time, by mid-century and beyond, estimates of further reductions of non-CO<sub>2</sub> Kyoto-GHGs &#8211; in particular CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O &#8211; are hampered by the absence of mitigation options in the current generation of IAMs, which are hence not able to reduce residual emissions of sources linked to livestock production and fertilizer use (Clarke et al., 2014; Gernaat et al., 2015)<sup id="fnref:r217" class="bf-reference" data-ref="217"><a href="#fn:r217" rel="footnote">217</a></sup> (Sections 2.3.1.2, 2.4.4, Supplementary Material&#160; 2.SM.1.2). Therefore, while net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are projected to be markedly lower in 1.5&#176;C-consistent compared to 2&#176;C-consistent pathways, this is much less the case for methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous-oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) (Figures 2.6&#8211;2.7). This results in reductions of CO<sub>2</sub> being projected to take up the largest share of emissions reductions when moving between 1.5&#176;C-consistent and 2&#176;C-consistent pathways (Rogelj et al., 2015b, 2018; Luderer et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r218" class="bf-reference" data-ref="218"><a href="#fn:r218" rel="footnote">218</a></sup>. If additional non-CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation measures are identified and adequately included in IAMs, they are expected to further contribute to mitigation efforts by lowering the floor of residual non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. However, the magnitude of these potential contributions has not been assessed as part of this report.</p>
</li><li><h2>section-2-3-3-block-1_p7</h2><p id="section-2-3-3-block-1_p7">As a result of the interplay between residual CO<sub>2</sub> and non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and CDR, global GHG emissions reach net zero levels at different times in different 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways. Interquartile ranges of the years in which 1.5&#176;C-low-OS and 1.5&#176;C-high-OS reach net zero GHG emissions range from 2060 to 2080 (Table 2.4). A seesaw characteristic can be found between near-term emissions reductions and the timing of net zero GHG emissions. This is because pathways with limited emissions reductions in the next one to two decades require net negative CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions later on (see earlier). Most 1.5&#176;C-high-OS pathways lead to net zero GHG emissions in approximately the third quarter of this century, because all of them rely on significant amounts of annual net negative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the second half of the century to decline temperatures after overshoot (Table 2.4). However, in pathways that aim at limiting overshoot as much as possible or more slowly decline temperatures after their peak, emissions reach the point of net zero GHG emissions slightly later or at times never. Early emissions reductions in this case reduce the requirement for net negative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Estimates of 2030 GHG emissions in line with the current NDCs overlap with the highest quartile of 1.5&#176;C-high-OS pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4).</p>

Near-term differences between the various pathway classes are apparent, however. For instance, Below-1.5&#176;C and 1.5&#176;C-low-OS pathways show a clear shift towards lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2030 relative to other 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C pathway classes, although in all 1.5&#176;C classes reductions are clear (Figure 2.6). These lower near-term emissions levels are a direct consequence of the former two pathway classes limiting cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions until carbon neutrality in order to aim for a higher probability of limiting peak warming to 1.5&#176;C (Section 2.2.2 and 2.3.2.2). In some cases, 1.5&#176;C-low-OS pathways achieve net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions one or two decades later, contingent on 2030 CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the lower quartile of the literature range, that is, below about 18 GtCO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>&#8722;</sup><sup>1</sup>.

Below-1.5&#176;C and 1.5&#176;C-low-OS pathways combined show a decline in global net anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 (40&#8211;60% interquartile range).

Figure 2.6 shows net CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from various sources in 2050 and 2100 in 1.5&#176;C pathways in the literature. Virtually all 1.5&#176;C pathways obtain net negative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at some point during the 21st century, but the extent to which net negative emissions are relied upon varies substantially (Figure 2.6, Table 2.4). This net withdrawal of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere compensates for residual long-lived non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHG emissions that also accumulate in the atmosphere (like N<sub>2</sub>O) or cancels some of the build-up of CO<sub>2</sub> due to earlier emissions to achieve increasingly higher likelihoods that warming stays or returns below 1.5&#176;C (see Section 2.3.4 for a discussion of various uses of CDR). Even non-overshoot pathways that aim at achieving temperature stabilization would hence deploy a certain amount of net negative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to offset any accumulating long-lived non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHGs. The 1.5&#176;C overshoot pathways display significantly larger amounts of annual net negative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the second half of the century.

This means that reducing all SLCF emissions to zero would result in a short-term warming, although this warming is <em>unlikely</em> to be more than 0.5&#176;C (Section 2.2 and Figure 1.5 (Samset et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r234" class="bf-reference" data-ref="234"><a href="#fn:r234" rel="footnote">234</a></sup>). Because of this effect, suggestions have been proposed that target the warming agents only (referred to as short-lived climate pollutants or SLCPs instead of the more general short-lived climate forcers; e.g., Shindell et al., 2012)<sup id="fnref:r235" class="bf-reference" data-ref="235"><a href="#fn:r235" rel="footnote">235</a></sup>, though aerosols are often emitted in varying mixtures of warming and cooling species (Bond et al., 2013)<sup id="fnref:r236" class="bf-reference" data-ref="236"><a href="#fn:r236" rel="footnote">236</a></sup>. Black carbon (BC) emissions reach similar levels across 1.5&#176;C-consistent and 2&#176;C-consistent pathways available in the literature, with interquartile ranges of emissions reductions across pathways of 16&#8211;34% and 48&#8211;58% in 2030 and 2050, respectively, relative to 2010 (Figure 2.7). Recent studies have identified further reduction potentials for the near term, with global reductions of about 80% being suggested (Stohl et al., 2015; Klimont et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r237" class="bf-reference" data-ref="237"><a href="#fn:r237" rel="footnote">237</a></sup>. Because the dominant sources of certain aerosol mixtures are emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels, the rapid phase-out of unabated fossil fuels to avoid CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would also result in removal of these either warming or cooling SLCF air-pollutant species. Furthermore, SLCFs are also reduced by efforts to reduce particulate air pollution. For example, year-2050 SO<sub>2</sub> emissions (precursors of sulphate aerosol) in 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways are about 75&#8211;85% lower than their 2010 levels. Some caveats apply, for example, if residential biomass use would be encouraged in industrialised countries in stringent mitigation pathways without appropriate pollution control measures, aerosol concentrations could also increase (Sand et al., 2015; Stohl et al., 2015)<sup id="fnref:r238" class="bf-reference" data-ref="238"><a href="#fn:r238" rel="footnote">238</a></sup>.</p>

A set of key questions emerge: how strongly do 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways rely on CDR deployment and what types of CDR measures are deployed at which scale? How does this vary across available 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways and on which factors does it depend? How does CDR deployment compare between 1.5&#176;C- and 2&#176;C-consistent pathways and how does it compare with the findings at the time of the AR5? How does CDR deployment in 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways relate to questions about availability, policy implementation and sustainable development implications that have been raised about CDR technologies? The first three questions are assessed in this section with the goal to provide an overview and assessment of CDR deployment in the 1.5&#176;C pathway literature. The fourth question is only touched upon here and is addressed in greater depth in Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7, which assesses the rapidly growing literature on costs, potentials, availability and sustainability implications of individual CDR measures (Minx et al., 2017, 2018; Fuss et al., 2018; Nemet et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r252" class="bf-reference" data-ref="252"><a href="#fn:r252" rel="footnote">252</a></sup>. In addition, Section 2.3.5 assesses the relationship between delayed mitigation action and increased CDR reliance. CDR deployment is intricately linked to the land-use transformation in 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways. This transformation is assessed in Section 2.4.4. Bioenergy and BECCS impacts on sustainable land management are further assessed in Chapter 3, Section 3.6.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3.

It is this flexibility that makes bioenergy and bioenergy technologies valuable for the decarbonization of energy use (Klein et al., 2014; Krey et al., 2014a; Rose et al., 2014a; Bauer et al., 2017, 2018)<sup id="fnref:r292" class="bf-reference" data-ref="292"><a href="#fn:r292" rel="footnote">292</a></sup>. Most bioenergy technologies in IAMs are also available in combination with CCS (BECCS). Assumed capture rates differ between technologies, for example, about 90% for electricity and hydrogen production and about 40&#8211;50% for liquid fuel production. Decisions about bioenergy deployment in IAMs are based on economic considerations to stay within a carbon budget that is consistent with a long-term climate goal. IAMs consider both the value of bioenergy in the energy system and the value of BECCS in removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. Typically, if bioenergy is strongly limited, BECCS technologies with high capture rates are favoured. If bioenergy is plentiful IAMs tend to choose biofuel technologies with lower capture rates but high value for replacing fossil fuels in transport (Kriegler et al., 2013a; Bauer et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r293" class="bf-reference" data-ref="293"><a href="#fn:r293" rel="footnote">293</a></sup>.

Detailed process IAMs include land-use models that capture competition for land for different uses (food, feed, fiber, bioenergy, carbon storage, biodiversity protection) under a range of dynamic factors including socio-economic drivers, productivity increases in crop and livestock systems, food demand, and land, environmental, biodiversity, and carbon policies.

However, IAMs with spatially explicit land-use modelling include a full accounting of land-use change emissions comprising carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere and soils. Net CDR in the AFOLU sector, including but not restricted to afforestation and reforestation, can thus in principle be inferred by comparing AFOLU CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between a baseline scenario and a 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathway from the same model and study. However, baseline AFOLU CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can not only be reduced by CDR in the AFOLU sector but also by measures to reduce deforestation and preserve land carbon stocks. The pathway literature and pathway data available to this assessment do not yet allow separating the two contributions. As a conservative approximation, the additional net negative AFOLU CO<sub>2</sub> emissions below the baseline are taken as a proxy for AFOLU CDR in this assessment. Because this does not include CDR that was deployed before reaching net zero AFOLU CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, this approximation is a lower-bound for terrestrial CDR in the AFOLU sector (including all mitigation-policy-related factors that lead to net negative AFOLU CO<sub>2</sub> emissions).</p>

Both BECCS (480 [0&#8211;1000] GtCO<sub>2 </sub>in 1.5&#176;C pathways with no or limited overshoot) and AFOLU CDR measures including afforestation and reforestation (210 [10-540] GtCO<sub>2 </sub>in1.5&#176;C pathways with no or limited overshoot) can play a major role,<sup id="fnref:4" class="bf-footnote" data-fn="4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> but for both cases pathways exist where they play no role at all. This shows the flexibility in substituting between individual CDR measures, once a portfolio of options becomes available. The high end of the CDR deployment range is populated by high overshoot pathways, as illustrated by pathway archetype <em>S5</em> based on SSP5 (fossil-fuelled development, see Section 2.3.1.1) and characterized by very large BECCS deployment to return warming to 1.5&#176;C by 2100 (Kriegler et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r271" class="bf-reference" data-ref="271"><a href="#fn:r271" rel="footnote">271</a></sup>.

These are pathways with very low energy demand facilitating the rapid phase-out of fossil fuels and process emissions that exclude BECCS and CCS use (Grubler et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r272" class="bf-reference" data-ref="272"><a href="#fn:r272" rel="footnote">272</a></sup> and/or pathways with rapid shifts to sustainable food consumption freeing up sufficient land areas for afforestation and reforestation (Haberl et al., 2011; van Vuuren et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r273" class="bf-reference" data-ref="273"><a href="#fn:r273" rel="footnote">273</a></sup>.

</li><li><h2>section-2-3-4-1-block-3_p1</h2><p id="section-2-3-4-1-block-3_p1">As discussed in Section 2.3.2, CDR can be used in two ways in mitigation pathways: (i) to move more rapidly towards the point of carbon neutrality and maintain it afterwards in order to stabilize global mean temperature rise, and (ii) to produce net negative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, drawing down anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere in order to decline global mean temperature after an overshoot peak (Kriegler et al., 2018b; Obersteiner et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r283" class="bf-reference" data-ref="283"><a href="#fn:r283" rel="footnote">283</a></sup>. Both uses are important in 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways (Figure 2.9 and 2.10). Because of the tighter remaining 1.5&#176;C carbon budget, and because many pathways in the literature do not restrict exceeding this budget prior to 2100, the relative weight of the net negative emissions component of CDR increases compared to 2&#176;C-consistent pathways. The amount of compensatory CDR remains roughly the same over the century. This is the net effect of stronger deployment of compensatory CDR until mid-century to accelerate the approach to carbon neutrality and less compensatory CDR in the second half of the century due to deeper mitigation of end-use sectors in 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways (Luderer et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r284" class="bf-reference" data-ref="284"><a href="#fn:r284" rel="footnote">284</a></sup>. Comparing median levels, end-of-century net cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are roughly 600 GtCO<sub>2</sub> smaller in 1.5&#176;C compared to 2&#176;C-consistent pathways, with approximately two thirds coming from further reductions of gross CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the remaining third from increased CDR deployment. As a result, median levels of total CDR deployment in 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways are larger than in 2&#176;C-consistent pathways (Figure 2.9), but with marked variations in each pathway class.</p>

BECCS deployment is still limited in 2030, but ramps up to median levels of 3 (Below-1.5&#176;C), 5 (1.5&#176;C-low-OS) and 7 GtCO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (1.5&#176;C-high-OS) in 2050, and to 6 (Below-1.5&#176;C), 12 (1.5&#176;C-low-OS) and 15 GtCO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (1.5&#176;C-high-OS) in 2100, respectively. In 1.5&#176;C pathways with no or limited overshoot, this amounts to 0&#8211;1, 0&#8211;8, and 0&#8211;16 GtCO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>&#8722;</sup><sup>1</sup> in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively (ranges refer to the union of the min-max range of the Below-1.5&#176;C and the interquartile range of the 1.5&#176;C-low-OS class; see Table 2.4). Net CDR in the AFOLU sector reaches slightly lower levels in 2050, and stays more constant until 2100. In 1.5&#176;C pathways with no or limited overshoot, AFOLU CDR amounts to 0&#8211;5, 1&#8211;11, and 1&#8211;5 GtCO2 yr<sup>&#8722;</sup><sup>1</sup> (see above for the definition of the ranges) in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. In contrast to BECCS, AFOLU CDR is more strongly deployed in non-overshoot than overshoot pathways. This indicates differences in the timing of the two CDR approaches. Afforestation is scaled up until around mid-century, when the time of carbon neutrality is reached in 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways, while BECCS is projected to be used predominantly in the 2nd half of the century (Figure 2.5). This reflects the fact that afforestation is a readily available CDR technology, while BECCS is more costly and much less mature a technology. As a result, the two options contribute differently to compensating concurrent CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (until 2050) and to producing net negative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (post-2050). BECCS deployment is particularly strong in pathways with high overshoots but can also feature in pathways with low overshoot (see Figure 2.5 and 2.10). Annual deployment levels until mid-century are not found to be significantly different between 2&#176;C-consistent pathways and 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways with no or low overshoot. This suggests similar implementation challenges for ramping up BECCS deployment at the rates projected in the pathways (Honegger and Reiner, 2018; Nemet et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r285" class="bf-reference" data-ref="285"><a href="#fn:r285" rel="footnote">285</a></sup>.

The projections of IAMs and IEA studies show rather different trends, especially in the carbon intensity. These differences come from various factors, including the deployment of CCS, the level of fuel switching and efficiency improvements, and the effect of structural and behavioural changes. IAM projections are generally optimistic for the industry sectors, but not for buildings and transport sectors. Although GDP increases by a factor of 3.4 from 2010 to 2050, the total energy consumption of end-use sectors grows by only about 30% and 20% in 1.5&#176;C overshoot and 2&#176;C-consistent pathways, respectively. However, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would need to be reduced further to achieve the stringent temperature limits. Figure 2.20 shows that the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of end-use sectors is larger and more rapid in 1.5&#176;C overshoot than 2&#176;C-consistent pathways, while emissions from the power sector are already almost zero in 2050 in both sets of pathways, indicating that supply-side emissions reductions are almost fully exploited already in 2&#176;C-consistent pathways (see Figure 2.20) (Rogelj et al., 2015b, 2018; Luderer et al., 2016b)<sup id="fnref:r404" class="bf-reference" data-ref="404"><a href="#fn:r404" rel="footnote">404</a></sup>. The emission reductions in end-use sectors are largely made possible by efficiency improvements, demand reduction measures and electrification, but the level of emissions reductions varies across end-use sectors. While the carbon intensity of the industry and buildings sectors decreases to a very low level of around 10 gCO<sub>2</sub> MJ<sup>-1</sup>, the carbon intensity of transport becomes the highest of any sector by 2040 due to its higher reliance on oil-based fuels.

IEA ETP estimates the relative contribution of different measures for CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction in their B2DS scenario compared with their reference scenario in 2050 as follows: energy efficiency 42%, innovative process and CCS 37%, switching to low-carbon fuels and feedstocks 13% and material efficiency (include efficient production and use to contribute to demand reduction) 8%.

Electrification contributes to the reduction of direct CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by replacing carbon-intensive fuels, like oil and coal. Furthermore, when combined with a rapid decarbonization of the power system (see Section 2.4.1) it also enables further reduction of indirect CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from electricity. Sectoral bottom-up models generally estimate lower electrification potentials for the buildings sector in comparison to global IAMs (see Figure 2.22). Besides CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, increasing global demand for air conditioning in buildings may also lead to increased emissions of HFCs in this sector over the next few decades. Although these gases are currently a relatively small proportion of annual GHG emissions, their use in the air conditioning sector is expected to grow rapidly over the next few decades if alternatives are not adopted.

Energy savings from shifts to high-performance lighting, appliances, and water heating equipment account for a further 24% of the total reduction. The long-term, strategic shift away from fossil-fuel use in buildings, alongside the rapid uptake of energy efficient, integrated and renewable energy technologies (with clean power generation), leads to a drastic reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

Whether these dynamics accurately reflect the actual mitigation potential of structural changes in transport activity and modal choice is a point of investigation.

The reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the whole sector from the reference scenario to ETP-B2DS is 60% in 2050, with varying contributions per mode (Table 2.8). Since there is no silver bullet for this deep decarbonization, every possible measure would be required to achieve this stringent emissions outcome. The contribution of various measures for the CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction from the reference scenario to the IEA-B2DS in 2050 can be decomposed to efficiency improvement (29%), biofuels (36%), electrification (15%), and avoid/shift (20%) (IEA, 2017a)<sup id="fnref:r426" class="bf-reference" data-ref="426"><a href="#fn:r426" rel="footnote">426</a></sup>.

The SSP pathway ensemble hence allows for a structured exploration of AFOLU transitions in the context of climate change mitigation in line with 1.5&#176;C, taking into account technological and socio-economic aspects. Other considerations, like food security, livelihoods and biodiversity, are also of importance when identifying AFOLU strategies. These are at present only tangentially explored by the SSPs. Further assessments of AFOLU mitigation options are provided in other parts of this report and in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL). Chapter 4 provides an assessment of bioenergy (including feedstocks, see Section 4.3.1), livestock management (Section 4.3.1), reducing rates of deforestation and other land-based mitigation options (as mitigation and adaptation option, see Section 4.3.2), and BECCS, afforestation and reforestation options (including the bottom-up literature of their sustainable potential, mitigation cost and side effects, Section 4.3.7). Chapter 3 discusses impacts land-based CDR (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3). Chapter 5 assesses the sustainable development implications of AFOLU mitigation, including impacts on biodiversity (Section 5.4). Finally, the SRCCL will undertake a more comprehensive assessment of land and climate change aspects. For the sake of complementarity, this section focusses on the magnitude and pace of land transitions in 1.5&#176;C pathways, as well as on the implications of different AFOLU mitigation strategies for different land types. The interactions with other societal objectives and potential limitations of identified AFOLU measures link to these large-scale evolutions, but these are assessed elsewhere (see above).</p>
</li><li><h2>section-2-4-4-block-1_p3</h2><p id="section-2-4-4-block-1_p3">Land-use changes until mid-century occur in the large majority of SSP pathways, both under stringent mitigation and in absence of mitigation (Figure 2.24). In the latter case, changes are mainly due to socio-economic drivers like growing demands for food, feed and wood products. General transition trends can be identified for many land types in 1.5&#176;C pathways, which differ from those in baseline scenarios and depend on the interplay with mitigation in other sectors (Figure 2.24) (Popp et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r435" class="bf-reference" data-ref="435"><a href="#fn:r435" rel="footnote">435</a></sup>. Mitigation that demands land mainly occurs at the expense of agricultural land for food and feed production. Additionally, some biomass is projected to be grown on marginal land or supplied from residues and waste, but at lower shares. Land for second-generation energy crops (such as <em>Miscanthus</em> or poplar) expands by 2030 and 2050 in all available pathways that assume a cost-effective achievement of a 1.5&#176;C temperature goal in 2100 (Figure 2.24), but the scale depends strongly on underlying socio-economic assumptions (see later discussion of land pathway archetypes). Reducing rates of deforestation restricts agricultural expansion, and forest cover can expand strongly in 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C pathways alike compared to its extent in no-climate-policy baselines due to reduced deforestation and afforestation and reforestation measures. However, the extent to which forest cover expands varies highly across models in the literature, with some models projecting forest cover to stay virtually constant or decline slightly. This is due to whether afforestation and reforestation is included as a mitigation technology in these pathways and interactions with other sectors.</p>

Furthermore, cropland for food and feed production decreases in most 1.5&#176;C pathways, both compared to a no-climate baseline and relative to 2010. These reductions in agricultural land for food and feed production are facilitated by intensification on agricultural land and in livestock production systems (Popp et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r436" class="bf-reference" data-ref="436"><a href="#fn:r436" rel="footnote">436</a></sup>, as well as changes in consumption patterns (Frank et al., 2017; Fujimori, 2017)<sup id="fnref:r437" class="bf-reference" data-ref="437"><a href="#fn:r437" rel="footnote">437</a></sup> (see also Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2 for an assessment of these mitigation options).

The pace of projected cropland changes overlaps with historical trends over the past four decades, but in several cases also goes well beyond this range. By the 2030&#8211;2050 period, the projected reductions in pasture and potentially strong increases in forest cover imply a reversed dynamic compared to historical and baseline trends. This suggests that distinct policy and government measures would be needed to achieve forest increases, particularly in a context of projected increased bioenergy use.</p>

For example, among the four illustrative archetypes used in this chapter (Section 2.1), the LED and S1 pathways focus on generally low resource and energy consumption (including healthy diets with low animal-calorie shares and low food waste) as well as significant agricultural intensification in combination with high levels of nature protection. Under such assumptions, comparably small amounts of land are needed for land-demanding mitigation activities such as BECCS and afforestation and reforestation, leaving the land footprint for energy crops in 2050 virtually the same compared to 2010 levels for the LED pathway. In contrast, future land-use developments can look very different under the resource- and energy-intensive S5 pathway that includes less healthy diets with high animal shares and high shares of food waste (Tilman and Clark, 2014; Springmann et al., 2016)<sup id="fnref:r475" class="bf-reference" data-ref="475"><a href="#fn:r475" rel="footnote">475</a></sup> combined with a strong orientation towards technology solutions to compensate for high reliance on fossil-fuel resources and associated high levels of GHG emissions in the baseline. In such pathways, climate change mitigation strategies strongly depend on the availability of CDR through BECCS (Humpen&#246;der et al., 2014)<sup id="fnref:r476" class="bf-reference" data-ref="476"><a href="#fn:r476" rel="footnote">476</a></sup>. As a consequence, the S5 pathway sources significant amounts of biomass through bioenergy crop expansion in combination with agricultural intensification. Also, further policy assumptions can strongly affect land-use developments, highlighting the importance for land use of making appropriate policy choices. For example, within the SSP set, some pathways rely strongly on a policy to incentivize afforestation and reforestation for CDR together with BECCS, which results in an expansion of forest area and a corresponding increase in terrestrial carbon stock. Finally, the variety of pathways illustrates how policy choices in the AFOLU and other sectors strongly affect land-use developments and associated sustainable development interactions (Chapter 5, Section 5.4) in 1.5&#176;C pathways.</p>

A third concept, the <strong>Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)</strong> measures the total net damages of an extra metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to the associated climate change (Nordhaus, 2014; Pizer et al., 2014; Rose et al., 2017a)<sup id="fnref:r530" class="bf-reference" data-ref="530"><a href="#fn:r530" rel="footnote">530</a></sup>.

Equating the present value of future damages and marginal abatement costs includes a number of critical value judgements in the formulation of the social welfare function (SWF), particularly in how non-market damages and the distribution of damages across countries and individuals and between current and future generations are valued (Kolstad et al., 2014)<sup id="fnref:r532" class="bf-reference" data-ref="532"><a href="#fn:r532" rel="footnote">532</a></sup>. For example, since climate damages accrue to a larger extent farther in the future and can persist for many years, assumptions and approaches to determine the social discount rate (normative &#8216;prescriptive&#8217; vs. positive &#8216;descriptive&#8217;) and social welfare function (e.g., discounted utilitarian SWF vs. undiscounted prioritarian SWF) can heavily influence CBA outcomes and associated estimates of SCC (Kolstad et al., 2014; Pizer et al., 2014; Adler and Treich, 2015; Adler et al., 2017; NASEM, 2017; Nordhaus, 2017; Rose et al., 2017a)<sup id="fnref:r533" class="bf-reference" data-ref="533"><a href="#fn:r533" rel="footnote">533</a></sup>.</p>
</li><li><h2>section-2-5-1-block-1_p3</h2><p id="section-2-5-1-block-1_p3">In CEA, the marginal abatement cost of carbon is determined by the climate goal under consideration. It equals the shadow price of carbon associated with the goal which in turn can be interpreted as the willingness to pay for imposing the goal as a political constraint. Emissions prices are usually expressed in carbon (equivalent) prices using the GWP-100 metric as the exchange rate for pricing emissions of non-CO<sub>2</sub> GHGs controlled under internationally climate agreements (like CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and fluorinated gases, see Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1).<sup id="fnref:13" class="bf-footnote" data-fn="13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> Since policy goals like the goals of limiting warming to 1.5&#176;C or well below 2&#176;C do not directly result from a money metric trade-off between mitigation and damages, associated shadow prices can differ from the SCC in a CBA. In CEA, value judgments are to a large extent concentrated in the choice of climate goal and related implications, while more explicit assumptions about social values are required to perform CBA. For example, in CEA assumptions about the social discount rate no longer affect the overall abatement levels now set by the climate goal, but the choice and timing of investments in individual measures to reach these levels.</p>

For instance, undiscounted values under a Higher-2&#176;C pathway range from 15&#8211;220 USD2010 tCO<sub>2-eq</sub> <sup>&#8722;1</sup> in 2030, 45&#8211;1050 USD2010 tCO<sub>2-eq</sub><sup>&#8722;1</sup> in 2050, 120&#8211;1100 USD2010 tCO<sub>2-eq</sub><br>

On the contrary, estimates for a Below-1.5&#176;C pathway range from 135&#8211;6050 USD2010 tCO<sub>2-eq</sub><sup> &#8722;1</sup> in 2030, 245&#8211;14300 USD2010 tCO<sub>2-eq</sub><sup>&#8722;1</sup> in 2050, 420&#8211;19300 USD2010 tCO<sub>2-eq</sub><sup> &#8722;1</sup> in 2070 and 690&#8211;30100 USD2010 tCO<sub>2-eq</sub> <sup>&#8722;1</sup> in 2100. Values for 1.5&#176;C-low-OS pathway are relatively higher than 1.5&#176;C-high-OS pathway in 2030, but the difference decreases over time, particularly between 2050 and 2070. This is because in 1.5&#176;C-high-OS pathways there is relatively less mitigation activity in the first half of the century, but more in the second half. The low energy demand (LED, P1 in the Summary for Policymakers) scenario exhibits the lowest values across the illustrative pathway archetypes. As a whole, the global average discounted price of emissions across 1.5&#176;C- and 2&#176;C pathways differs by a factor of four across models (assuming a 5% annual discount rate, comparing to Below-1.5&#176;C and 1.5&#176;C-low-OS pathways). If 1.5&#176;C-high-OS pathways (with peak warming 0.1&#8211;0.4&#176;C higher than 1.5&#176;C) or pathways with very large land-use sinks are also considered, the differential value is reduced to a limited degree, from a factor 4 to a factor 3. The increase in mitigation costs between 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C pathways is based on a direct comparison of pathway pairs from the same model and the same study in which the 1.5&#176;C pathway assumes a significantly smaller carbon budget compared to the 2&#176;C pathway (e.g., 600 GtCO<sub>2</sub> smaller in the CD-LINKS and ADVANCE studies).

The narrow definition sets the boundary at the specific energy-using components or subsystems of the larger end-use technologies (e.g., compressor, car engine, heating element). Based on these two definitions, demand-side energy investments for the year 2005 were estimated about 1&#8211;3.5 trillion USD2010 (central estimate 1.7&#160;trillion USD2010) using the broad definition and 0.1&#8211;0.6 trillion USD2010 (central estimate 0.3 trillion USD2010) using the narrower definition.

Investments in the policy baselines from these same models are 1.6&#8211;2.7 trillion USD2010 yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Much hinges on the reductions in energy demand growth embodied in the 1.5&#176;C pathways, which require investing in energy efficiency. Studies suggest that annual supply-side investments by mid-century could be lowered by around 10% (McCollum et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r591" class="bf-reference" data-ref="591"><a href="#fn:r591" rel="footnote">591</a></sup> and in some cases up to 50% (Grubler et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r592" class="bf-reference" data-ref="592"><a href="#fn:r592" rel="footnote">592</a></sup> if strong policies to limit energy demand growth are successfully implemented.

</li><li><h2>section-2-5-2-2-block-1_p5</h2><p id="section-2-5-2-2-block-1_p5">Some trends are robust across scenarios (Figure 2.27). First, pursuing 1.5&#176;C mitigation efforts requires a major reallocation of the investment portfolio, implying a financial system aligned to mitigation challenges. The path laid out by countries&#8217; current NDCs until 2030 will not drive these structural changes; and despite increasing low-carbon investments in recent years (IEA, 2016b; Frankfurt School-UNEP Centre/BNEF, 2017)<sup id="fnref:r593" class="bf-reference" data-ref="593"><a href="#fn:r593" rel="footnote">593</a></sup>, these are not yet aligned with 1.5&#176;C. Second, additional annual average energy-related investments for the period 2016 to 2050 in pathways limiting warming to 1.5&#176;C compared to the baseline (i.e., pathways without new climate policies beyond those in place today) are estimated by the models employed in McCollum et al. (2018) to be around 830 billion USD2010 (range of 150 billion to 1700 billion USD2010 across six models). This compares to total annual average energy <em>supply</em> investments in 1.5&#176;C pathways of 1460 to 3510 billion USD2010 and total annual average energy <em>demand</em> investments of 640 to 910 billion USD2010 for the period 2016 to 2050. Total energy-related investments increase by about 12% (range of 3% to 24%) in 1.5&#176;C pathways relative to 2&#176;C pathways. Average annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency are upscaled by roughly a factor of six (range of factor of 4 to 10) by 2050 compared to 2015. Specifically, annual investments in low-carbon energy are projected to average 0.8&#8211;2.9 trillion USD2010 yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> globally to 2050 in 1.5&#176;C pathways, overtaking fossil investments globally already by around 2025 (McCollum et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r594" class="bf-reference" data-ref="594"><a href="#fn:r594" rel="footnote">594</a></sup>. The bulk of these investments are projected to be for clean electricity generation, particularly solar and wind power (0.09&#8211;1.0 trillion USD2010 yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and 0.1&#8211;0.35 trillion USD2010 yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, respectively) as well as nuclear power (0.1&#8211;0.25 trillion USD2010 yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). Third, the precise apportioning of these investments depends on model assumptions and societal preferences related to mitigation strategies and policy choices (see Sections 2.1 and 2.3). Investments for electricity transmission and distribution and storage are also scaled up in 1.5&#176;C pathways (0.3&#8211;1.3 trillion USD2010 yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), given their widespread electrification of the end-use sectors (see Section 2.4). Meanwhile, 1.5&#176;C pathways see a reduction in annual investments for fossil-fuel extraction and unabated fossil electricity generation (to 0.3&#8211;0.85 trillion USD2010 yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> on average over the 2016&#8211;2050 period). Investments in unabated coal are halted by 2030 in most 1.5&#176;C projections, while the literature is less conclusive for investments in unabated gas (McCollum et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r595" class="bf-reference" data-ref="595"><a href="#fn:r595" rel="footnote">595</a></sup>. This illustrates how mitigation strategies vary between models, but in the real world should be considered in terms of their societal desirability (see Section 2.5.3). Furthermore, some fossil investments made over the next few years &#8211; or those made in the last few &#8211; will <em>likely</em> need to be retired prior to fully recovering their capital investment or before the end of their operational lifetime (Bertram et al., 2015a; Johnson et al., 2015; OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017)<sup id="fnref:r596" class="bf-reference" data-ref="596"><a href="#fn:r596" rel="footnote">596</a></sup>.
