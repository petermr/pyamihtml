Global mean surface temperature (GMST) anomalies were about +0.87&#176;C (&#177;0.10&#176;C <em>likely</em> range) above pre-industrial industrial (1850&#8211;1900) values in the 2006-&#8211;2015 decade, with a recent warming of about 0.2&#176;C (&#177;0.10&#176;C) per decade (Chapter 1). Human-induced global warming reached approximately 1&#176;C (&#177;0.2&#176;C <em>likely</em> range) in 2017 (Chapter 1). While some of the observed trends may be due to internal climate variability, methods of detection and attribution can be applied to assess which part of the observed changes may be attributed to anthropogenic forcing (Bindoff et al., 2013b)<sup id="fnref:r3" class="bf-reference" data-ref="3"><a href="#fn:r3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Hence, evidence from attribution studies can be used to assess changes in the climate system that are already detectable at lower levels of global warming and would thus continue to change with a further 0.5&#176;C or 1&#176;C of global warming (see Supplementary Material 3.SM.1 and Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4 and 3.3.11).

Model simulations include experiments with global and regional climate models, as well as impact models &#8211; driven with output from climate models &#8211; to evaluate the risk related to climate change for natural and human systems (Supplementary Material 3.SM.1). Climate model simulations were generally used in the context of particular &#8216;climate scenarios&#8217; from previous IPCC reports (e.g., IPCC, 2007, 2013)<sup id="fnref:r6" class="bf-reference" data-ref="6"><a href="#fn:r6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>.

</li><li><h2>section-3-2-1-block-1_p5</h2><p id="section-3-2-1-block-1_p5">The assessment presented in the current chapter largely focuses on the analysis of transient responses in climate at 1.5&#176;C versus 2&#176;C and higher levels of global warming (see point A. above and Section 3.3). It generally uses the empirical scaling relationship (ESR) approach (Seneviratne et al., 2018c)<sup id="fnref:r13" class="bf-reference" data-ref="13"><a href="#fn:r13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup>, also termed the &#8216;time sampling&#8217; approach (James et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r14" class="bf-reference" data-ref="14"><a href="#fn:r14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup>, which consists of sampling the response at 1.5&#176;C and other levels of global warming from all available global climate model scenarios for the 21st century (e.g., Schleussner et al., 2016b; Seneviratne et al., 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r15" class="bf-reference" data-ref="15"><a href="#fn:r15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup>. The ESR approach focuses more on the derivation of a continuous relationship, while the term &#8216;time sampling&#8217; is more commonly used when comparing a limited number of warming levels (e.g., 1.5&#176;C versus 2&#176;C). A similar approach in the case of regional climate model (RCM) simulations consists of sampling the RCM model output corresponding to the time frame at which the driving general circulation model (GCM) reaches the considered temperature level, for example, as done within IMPACT2C (Jacob and Solman, 2017), see<sup id="fnref:r16" class="bf-reference" data-ref="16"><a href="#fn:r16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup>description in Vautard et al. (2014)<sup id="fnref:r17" class="bf-reference" data-ref="17"><a href="#fn:r17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup>. As an alternative to the ESR or time sampling approach, pattern scaling may be used. Pattern scaling is a statistical approach that describes relationships of specific climate responses as a function of global temperature change. Some assessments presented in this chapter are based on this method. The disadvantage of pattern scaling, however, is that the relationship may not perfectly emulate the models&#8217; responses at each location and for each global temperature level (James et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r18" class="bf-reference" data-ref="18"><a href="#fn:r18" rel="footnote">18</a></sup>. Expert judgement is a third methodology that can be used to assess probable changes at 1.5&#176;C or 2&#176;C of global warming by combining changes that have been attributed to the observed time period (corresponding to warming of 1&#176;C or less if assessed over a shorter period) with known projected changes at 3&#176;C or 4&#176;C above pre-industrial temperatures (Supplementary Material 3.SM.1). In order to assess effects induced by a 0.5&#176;C difference in global warming, the historical record can be used at first approximation as a proxy, meaning that conditions are compared for two periods that have a 0.5&#186;C difference in GMST warming (such as 1991&#8211;2010 and 1960&#8211;1979, e.g., Schleussner et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r19" class="bf-reference" data-ref="19"><a href="#fn:r19" rel="footnote">19</a></sup>. This in particular also applies to attributed changes in extremes since 1950 that were reported in the IPCC AR5 report (IPCC, 2013<sup id="fnref:r20" class="bf-reference" data-ref="20"><a href="#fn:r20" rel="footnote">20</a></sup>; see also 3.SM.1). Using observations, however, it is not possible to account for potential non-linear changes that could occur above 1&#176;C of global warming or as 1.5&#176;C of warming is reached.</p>
</li><li><h2>section-3-2-1-block-1_p6</h2><p id="section-3-2-1-block-1_p6">In some cases, assessments of short-term stabilization responses are also presented, derived using a subset of model simulations that reach a given temperature limit by 2100, or driven by sea surface temperature (SST) values consistent with such scenarios. This includes new results from the &#8216;Half a degree additional warming, prognosis and projected impacts&#8217; (HAPPI) project (Section 1.5.2; Mitchell et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r21" class="bf-reference" data-ref="21"><a href="#fn:r21" rel="footnote">21</a></sup>. Notably, there is evidence that for some variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation extremes), responses after short-term stabilization (i.e., approximately equivalent to the RCP2.6 scenario) are very similar to the transient response of higher-emissions scenarios (Seneviratne et al., 2016, 2018c; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Tebaldi and Knutti, 2018)<sup id="fnref:r22" class="bf-reference" data-ref="22"><a href="#fn:r22" rel="footnote">22</a></sup>.

Another approach is to use conclusions from analyses of past climates combined with modelling of the relationships between climate drivers and natural systems (Box 3.3). A more complex approach relies on laboratory or field experiments (Dove et al., 2013; Bonal et al., 2016)<sup id="fnref:r28" class="bf-reference" data-ref="28"><a href="#fn:r28" rel="footnote">28</a></sup>, which provide useful information on the causal effect of a few factors, which can be as diverse as climate, greenhouse gases (GHG), management practices, and biological and ecological variables, on specific natural systems that may have unusual physical and chemical characteristics (e.g., Fabricius et al., 2011; Allen et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r29" class="bf-reference" data-ref="29"><a href="#fn:r29" rel="footnote">29</a></sup>.

</li><li><h2>section-3-2-2-block-1_p3</h2><p id="section-3-2-2-block-1_p3">Risks for natural and human systems are often assessed with impact models where climate inputs are provided by representative concentration pathway (RCP)-based climate projections. The number of studies projecting impacts at 1.5&#176;C or 2&#176;C of global warming has increased in recent times (see Section 3.4), even if the four RCP scenarios used in AR5 are not strictly associated with these levels of global warming. Several approaches have been used to extract the required climate scenarios, as described in Section 3.2.1. As an example, Schleussner et al. (2016b)<sup id="fnref:r30" class="bf-reference" data-ref="30"><a href="#fn:r30" rel="footnote">30</a></sup> applied a time sampling (or ESR) approach, described in Section 3.2.1, to estimate the differential effect of 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C of global warming on water availability and impacts on agriculture using an ensemble of simulations under the RCP8.5 scenario. As a further example using a different approach, Iizumi et al. (2017)<sup id="fnref:r31" class="bf-reference" data-ref="31"><a href="#fn:r31" rel="footnote">31</a></sup> derived a 1.5&#176;C scenario from simulations with a crop model using an interpolation between the no-change (approximately 2010) conditions and the RCP2.6 scenario (with a global warming of 1.8&#176;C in 2100), and they derived the corresponding 2&#176;C scenario from RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 simulations in 2100.

</li><li><h2>section-3-2-2-block-1_p4</h2><p id="section-3-2-2-block-1_p4">Assessment of local impacts of climate change necessarily involves a change in scale, such as from the global scale to that of natural or human systems (Frieler et al., 2017; Reyer et al., 2017d; Jacob et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r34" class="bf-reference" data-ref="34"><a href="#fn:r34" rel="footnote">34</a></sup>. An appropriate method of downscaling (Supplementary Material 3.SM.1) is crucial for translating perspectives on 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C of global warming to scales and impacts relevant to humans and ecosystems. A major challenge associated with this requirement is the correct reproduction of the variance of local to regional changes, as well as the frequency and amplitude of extreme events (Vautard et al., 2014)<sup id="fnref:r35" class="bf-reference" data-ref="35"><a href="#fn:r35" rel="footnote">35</a></sup>.

</li><li><h2>section-3-2-2-block-1_p5</h2><p id="section-3-2-2-block-1_p5">Another major challenge relates to the propagation of the uncertainties at each step of the methodology, from the global forcings to the global climate and from regional climate to impacts at the ecosystem level, considering local disturbances and local policy effects. The risks for natural and human systems are the result of complex combinations of global and local drivers, which makes quantitative uncertainty analysis difficult. Such analyses are partly done using multimodel approaches, such as multi-climate and multi-impact models (Warszawski et al., 2013, 2014; Frieler et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r37" class="bf-reference" data-ref="37"><a href="#fn:r37" rel="footnote">37</a></sup>.

The section builds upon assessments from the IPCC AR5&#160;WGI report (Bindoff et al., 2013a; Christensen et al., 2013; Collins et al., 2013; Hartmann et al., 2013; IPCC, 2013)<sup id="fnref:r40" class="bf-reference" data-ref="40"><a href="#fn:r40" rel="footnote">40</a></sup> and Chapter 3 of the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX; Seneviratne et al., 2012)<sup id="fnref:r41" class="bf-reference" data-ref="41"><a href="#fn:r41" rel="footnote">41</a></sup>, as well as a substantial body of new literature related to projections of climate at 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C of warming above the pre-industrial period (e.g., Vautard et al., 2014; Fischer and Knutti, 2015; Schleussner et al., 2016b, 2017; Seneviratne et al., 2016, 2018c; D&#233;qu&#233; et al., 2017; Maule et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2017, 2018a; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Zaman et al., 2017; Betts et al., 2018; Jacob et al., 2018; Kharin et al., 2018; Wehner et al., 2018b)<sup id="fnref:r42" class="bf-reference" data-ref="42"><a href="#fn:r42" rel="footnote">42</a></sup>.

AR5 assessed that the globally averaged temperature (combined over land and ocean) displayed a warming of about 0.85&#176;C [0.65&#176;C to 1.06&#176;C] during the period 1880&#8211;2012, with a large fraction of the detected global warming being attributed to anthropogenic forcing (Bindoff et al., 2013a; Hartmann et al., 2013; Stocker et al., 2013)<sup id="fnref:r45" class="bf-reference" data-ref="45"><a href="#fn:r45" rel="footnote">45</a></sup>.

In addition, a global warming of 2&#176;C versus 1.5&#176;C results in robust differences in the mean temperatures in almost all locations, both on land and in the ocean (<em>high confidence</em>). The land&#8211;sea contrast in warming is important and implies particularly large changes in temperature over land, with mean warming of more than 1.5&#176;C in most land regions (<em>high confidence</em>; see Section 3.3.2 for more details). The largest increase in mean temperature is found in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (<em>high confidence</em>; Figure 3.3, see Section 3.3.2 for more details). Projections for precipitation are more uncertain, but they highlight robust increases in mean precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes at 1.5&#186;C global warming versus pre-industrial conditions, as well as at 2&#186;C global warming versus pre-industrial conditions (<em>high confidence)</em> (Figure 3.3). There are consistent but less robust signals when comparing changes in mean precipitation at 2&#186;C versus 1.5&#176;C of global warming. Hence, it is assessed that there is <em>medium confidence</em> in an increase of mean precipitation in high-latitudes at 2&#186;C versus 1.5&#186;C of global warming (Figure 3.3). For droughts, changes in evapotranspiration and precipitation timing are also relevant (see Section 3.3.4). Figure 3.4 displays changes in temperature extremes (the hottest daytime temperature of the year, TXx, and the coldest night-time temperature of the year, TNn) and heavy precipitation (the annual maximum 5-day precipitation, Rx5day). These analyses reveal distinct patterns of changes, with the largest changes in TXx occurring on mid-latitude land and the largest changes in TNn occurring at high latitudes (both on land and in oceans). Differences in TXx and TNn compared to pre-industrial climate are robust at both global warming levels. Differences in TXx and TNn at 2&#176;C versus 1.5&#176;C of global warming are robust across most of the globe. Changes in heavy precipitation are less robust, but particularly strong increases are apparent at high latitudes as well as in the tropics at both 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C of global warming compared to pre-industrial conditions. The differences in heavy precipitation at 2&#186;C versus 1.5&#186;C global warming are generally not robust at grid-cell scale, but they display consistent increases in most locations (Figure 3.4). However, as addressed in Section 3.3.3, statistically significant differences are found in several large regions&#160;and when aggregated over the global land area. We thus assess that there is <em>high confidence</em> regarding global-scale differences in temperature means and extremes at 2&#176;C versus 1.5&#176;C global warming, and <em>medium confidence</em> regarding global-scale differences in precipitation means and extremes. Further analyses, including differences at 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C global warming versus 1&#176;C (i.e., present-day) conditions are provided in the Supplementary Material 3.SM.2.</p>

It should be noted that the different types of hazards are considered in isolation but some regions are projected to be affected by collocated and/or concomitant changes in several types of hazards (<em>high confidence</em>). Two examples are sea level rise and heavy precipitation in some regions, possibly leading together to more flooding, and droughts and heatwaves, which can together increase the risk of fire occurrence. Such events, also called compound events, may substantially increase risks in some regions (e.g., AghaKouchak et al., 2014; Van Den Hurk et al., 2015; Martius et al., 2016; Zscheischler et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r55" class="bf-reference" data-ref="55"><a href="#fn:r55" rel="footnote">55</a></sup>.

As an example, Figure 3.5 shows regionally-based analyses for the IPCC SREX regions (see Figure 3.2) of changes in the temperature of hot extremes as a function of global warming (corresponding analyses for changes in the temperature of cold extremes are provided in the Supplementary Material 3.SM.2). As demonstrated in these analyses, the mean response of the intensity of temperature extremes in climate models to changes in the global mean temperature is approximately linear and independent of the considered emissions scenario (Seneviratne et al., 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r71" class="bf-reference" data-ref="71"><a href="#fn:r71" rel="footnote">71</a></sup>.

For differences in regional temperature extremes at a mean global warming of 1.5&#176;C versus 2&#176;C, that is, a difference of 0.5&#186;C in global warming, this implies differences of as much as 1&#176;C&#8211;1.5&#176;C in some locations, which are two to three times larger than the differences in global mean temperature. For hot extremes, the strongest warming is found in central and eastern North America, central and southern Europe, the Mediterranean, western and central Asia, and southern Africa (Figures 3.4 and 3.5) (<em>medium confidence</em>).

Temperature increases of extreme hot days in mid-latitudes are projected to be up to two times the increase in GMST, that is, 3&#186;C at 1.5&#186;C GMST warming (<em>high confidence</em>). The highest levels of warming for extreme hot days are expected to occur in central and eastern North America, central and southern Europe, the Mediterranean, western and central Asia, and southern Africa (<em>medium confidence</em>). These regions have a strong soil-moisture-temperature coupling in common as well as increased dryness and, consequently, a reduction in evaporative cooling. However, there is a substantial range in the representation of these processes in models, in particular in central Europe and central North America (<em>medium confidence</em>). The coldest nights in high latitudes warm by as much as 1.5&#176;C for a 0.5&#176;C increase in GMST, corresponding to a threefold stronger warming (<em>high confidence</em>). NHD shows the largest differences between 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C in the tropics, because of the low interannual temperature variability there (<em>high confidence</em>); extreme heatwaves are thus projected to emerge earliest in these regions, and they are expected to become widespread already at 1.5&#176;C of global warming (<em>high confidence</em>). Limiting global warming to 1.5&#176;C instead of 2&#176;C could result in around 420 million fewer people being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves, and about 65 million fewer people being exposed to exceptional heatwaves, assuming constant vulnerability (<em>medium confidence</em>).</p>

Consistent with the majority of studies performed for higher degrees of global warming, the total number of tropical cyclones is projected to decrease under global warming, whilst the most intense (categories 4 and 5) cyclones are projected to occur more frequently. These very intense storms are projected to be associated with higher peak wind speeds and lower central pressures under 2&#176;C versus 1.5&#176;C of global warming. The accumulated cyclonic energy is projected to decrease globally from 1.5&#176;C to 2&#176;C, in association with a decrease in the global number of tropical cyclones under progressively higher levels of global warming.

Using a high resolution regional climate model explored the effects of different degrees of global warming on tropical cyclones over the southwest Indian Ocean, using transient simulations that downscaled a number of RCP8.5 GCM projections. Decreases in tropical cyclone frequencies are projected under both 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C of global warming. The decreases in cyclone frequencies under 2&#176;C of global warming are somewhat larger than under 1.5&#176;C, but no further decreases are projected under 3&#176;C. This suggests that 2&#176;C of warming, at least in these downscaling simulations, represents a type of stabilization level in terms of tropical cyclone formation over the southwest Indian Ocean and landfall over southern Africa (Muthige et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r244" class="bf-reference" data-ref="244"><a href="#fn:r244" rel="footnote">244</a></sup>.

Some studies are beginning to locate &#8216;refugial&#8217; areas where the climate remains suitable in the future for most of the species currently present. For example, Smith et al., (2018)<sup id="fnref:r487" class="bf-reference" data-ref="487"><a href="#fn:r487" rel="footnote">487</a></sup> estimated that 5.5&#8211;14% more of the globe&#8217;s terrestrial land area could act as climatic refugia for plants under 1.5&#176;C of warming compared to 2&#176;C.</p>

Previous sections of this report have described changes in the ocean, including rapid increases in ocean temperature down to a depth of at least 700 m (Section 3.3.7). In addition, anthropogenic carbon dioxide has decreased ocean pH and affected the concentration of ions in seawater such as carbonate (Sections 3.3.10 and 3.4.4.5), both over a similar depth range. Increased ocean temperatures have intensified storms in some regions (Section 3.3.6), expanded the ocean volume and increased sea levels globally (Section 3.3.9), reduced the extent of polar summer sea ice (Section 3.3.8), and decreased the overall solubility of the ocean for oxygen (Section 3.3.10). Importantly, changes in the response to climate change rarely operate in isolation. Consequently, the effect of global warming of 1.5&#176;C versus 2&#176;C must be considered in the light of multiple factors that may accumulate and interact over time to produce complex risks, hazards and impacts on human and natural systems.</p>

The new literature is used to confirm the levels of global warming at which risks are considered to increase from undetectable to moderate, from moderate to high, and from high to very high. Figure 3.21 modifies Figure 19.4 from AR5 WGII, and the following text in this subsection provides justification for the modifications. O&#8217;Neill et al. (2017)<sup id="fnref:r1122" class="bf-reference" data-ref="1122"><a href="#fn:r1122" rel="footnote">1122</a></sup> presented a very similar assessment to that of WGII AR5, but with further discussion of the potential to create &#8216;embers&#8217; specific to socio-economic scenarios in the future. There is insufficient literature to do this at present, so the original, simple approach has been used here. As the focus of the present assessment is on the consequences of global warming of 1.5&#176;C&#8211;2&#176;C above the pre-industrial period, no assessment for global warming of 3&#176;C or more is included in the figure (i.e., analysis is discontinued at 2.5&#176;C).</p>
</li><li><h2>section-3-5-2-1-block-1_p1</h2><p id="section-3-5-2-1-block-1_p1">WGII AR5 Chapter 19 found that some unique and threatened systems are at risk from climate change at current temperatures, with increasing numbers of systems at potential risk of severe consequences at global warming of 1.6&#176;C above pre-industrial levels. It was also observed that many species and ecosystems have a limited ability to adapt to the very large risks associated with warming of 2.6&#176;C or more, particularly Arctic sea ice and coral reef systems (<em>high confidence</em>). In the AR5 analysis, a transition from white to yellow indicated that the onset of moderate risk was located below present-day global temperatures (<em>medium confidence</em>); a transition from yellow to red indicated that the onset of high risk was located at 1.6&#176;C, and a transition from red to purple indicated that the onset of very high risk was located at about 2.6&#176;C. This WGII AR5 analysis already implied that there would be a significant reduction in risks to unique and threatened systems if warming were limited to 1.5&#176;C compared with 2&#176;C. Since AR5, evidence of present-day impacts in these systems has continued to grow (Sections 3.4.2, 3.4.4 and 3.4. 5), whilst new evidence has also accumulated for reduced risks at 1.5&#176;C compared to 2&#176;C of warming in Arctic ecosystems (Section 3.3.9), coral reefs (Section 3.4.4) and some other unique ecosystems (Section 3.4.3), as well as for biodiversity.</p>
</li><li><h2>section-3-5-2-1-block-1_p2</h2><p id="section-3-5-2-1-block-1_p2">New literature since AR5 has provided a closer focus on the comparative levels of risk to coral reefs at 1.5&#176;C versus 2&#176;C of global warming. As assessed in Section 3.4.4 and Box 3.4, reaching 2&#176;C will increase the frequency of mass coral bleaching and mortality to a point at which it will result in the total loss of coral reefs from the world&#8217;s tropical and subtropical regions. Restricting overall warming to 1.5&#176;C will still see a downward trend in average coral cover (70&#8211;90% decline by mid-century) but will prevent the total loss of coral reefs projected with warming of 2&#176;C (Frieler et al., 2013)<sup id="fnref:r1123" class="bf-reference" data-ref="1123"><a href="#fn:r1123" rel="footnote">1123</a></sup>. The remaining reefs at 1.5&#176;C will also benefit from increasingly stable ocean conditions by the mid-to-late 21st century. Limiting global warming to 1.5&#176;C during the course of the century may, therefore, open the window for many ecosystems to adapt or reassort geographically. This indicates a transition in risk in this system from high to very high (<em>high confidence</em>) at 1.5&#176;C of warming and contributes to a lowering of the transition from high to very high (Figure 3.21) in this RFC1 compared to in AR5.

Since AR5, the importance of a threshold between 1&#176;C and 2&#176;C has been further emphasized in the literature, with sea ice projected to persist throughout the year for a global warming of less than 1.5&#176;C, yet chances of an ice-free Arctic during summer being high at 2&#176;C of warming (Section 3.3.8). Less of the permafrost in the Arctic is projected to thaw under 1.5&#176;C of warming (17&#8211;44%) compared with under 2&#176;C (28&#8211;53%) (Section 3.3.5.2; Chadburn et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r1124" class="bf-reference" data-ref="1124"><a href="#fn:r1124" rel="footnote">1124</a></sup>, which is expected to reduce risks to both social and ecological systems in the Arctic.

In all these systems, impacts accrue with greater warming and impacts at 2&#176;C are expected to be greater than those at 1.5&#176;C (<em>medium confidence</em>). One study since AR5 has shown that constraining global warming to 1.5&#176;C would maintain the functioning of prairie pothole ecosystems in North America in terms of their productivity and biodiversity, whilst warming of 2&#176;C would not do so (Johnson et al., 2016)<sup id="fnref:r1125" class="bf-reference" data-ref="1125"><a href="#fn:r1125" rel="footnote">1125</a></sup>. The large proportion of insects projected to lose over half their range at 2&#176;C of warming (25%) compared to at 1.5&#176;C (9%) also suggests a significant loss of functionality in these threatened systems at 2&#176;C of warming, owing to the critical role of insects in nutrient cycling, pollination, detritivory and other important ecosystem processes (Section 3.4.3).</p>

Taken together, the evidence suggests that the transition from high to very high risk in unique and threatened systems occurs at a lower level of warming, between 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C (<em>high confidence</em>), than in AR5, where this transition was located at 2.6&#176;C. The transition from moderate to high risk relocates very slightly from 1.6&#176;C to 1.5&#176;C (<em>high confidence</em>).

As assessed in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, impacts of 0.5&#176;C of global warming can be identified for temperature extremes at global scales, based on observations and the analysis of climate models. At 2&#176;C of global warming, it is <em>likely</em> that temperature increases of more than 2&#176;C would occur over most land regions in terms of extreme temperatures (up to 4&#176;C&#8211;6&#176;C depending on region and considered extreme index) (Section 3.3.2, Table 3.2). Regional increases in temperature extremes can be robustly limited if global warming is constrained to 1.5&#176;C, with regional warmings of up to 3&#176;C&#8211;4.5&#176;C (Section 3.3.2, Table 3.2). Benefits obtained from this general reduction in extremes depend to a large extent on whether the lower range of increases in extremes at 1.5&#176;C is sufficient for critical thresholds to be exceeded, within the context of wide-ranging aspects such as crop yields, human health and the sustainability of ecosystems.</p>

It concluded with <em>medium confidence</em> that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to a global-scale intensification of heavy precipitation over the second half of the 20th century, for a global warming of approximately 0.5&#176;C (Section 3.3.3). A recent observation-based study likewise showed that a 0.5&#176;C increase in global mean temperature has had a detectable effect on changes in precipitation extremes at the global scale (Schleussner et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r1126" class="bf-reference" data-ref="1126"><a href="#fn:r1126" rel="footnote">1126</a></sup>, thus suggesting that there would be detectable differences in heavy precipitation at 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C of global warming.

Limiting global mean temperature increase to 1.5&#176;C as opposed to 2&#176;C could substantially reduce the risk of reduced regional water availability in some regions (Section 3.3.4).

The impact literature contains little information about the potential for human society to adapt to extreme weather events, and hence it has not been possible to locate the transition from high to very high risk within the context of assessing impacts at 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C of global warming.

AR5 located the transition from undetectable to moderate risk below recent temperatures, owing to the detection and attribution of regionally differentiated changes in crop yields (<em>medium to high confidence</em>; Figure 3.20), and new literature has continued to confirm this finding. Based on the assessment of risks to regional crop production and water resources, AR5 located the transition from moderate to high risk between 1.6&#176;C and 2.6&#176;C above pre-industrial levels. Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter highlights that at 2&#176;C of warming, new literature shows that risks of food shortage are projected to emerge in the African Sahel, the Mediterranean, central Europe, the Amazon, and western and southern Africa, and that these are much larger than the corresponding risks at 1.5&#176;C. This suggests a transition from moderate to high risk of regionally differentiated impacts between 1.5&#176;C and 2&#176;C above pre-industrial levels for food security (<em>medium confidence</em>) (Figure 3.20). Reduction in the availability of water resources at 2&#176;C is projected to be greater than 1.5&#176;C of global warming, although changes in socio-economics could have a greater influence (Section 3.4.2), with larger risks in the Mediterranean (Box 3.2); estimates of the magnitude of the risks remain similar to those cited in AR5.

A useful indicator associated with this instability is the threshold at which annual mass loss from the ice sheet by surface melt exceeds mass gain by snowfall. Previous estimates put this threshold at about 1.9&#176;C to 5.1&#176;C above pre-industrial temperatures (Gregory and Huybrechts, 2006)<sup id="fnref:r1366" class="bf-reference" data-ref="1366"><a href="#fn:r1366" rel="footnote">1366</a></sup>.
