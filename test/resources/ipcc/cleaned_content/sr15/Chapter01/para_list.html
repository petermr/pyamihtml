Even modest changes in rainfall and temperature patterns can push marginalized people into poverty as they lack the means to recover from associated impacts.

A range of pathways, both sustainable and not, are explored in this report, including implementation strategies to understand the enabling conditions and challenges required for such a transformation. These pathways and connected strategies are framed within the context of sustainable development, and in particular the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN, 2015b)<sup id="fnref:r48" class="bf-reference" data-ref="48"><a href="#fn:r48" rel="footnote">48</a></sup> and Cross-Chapter Box 4 on SDGs (in this chapter). The feasibility of staying within 1.5&#176;C depends upon a range of enabling conditions with geophysical, environmental&#8211;ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural, and institutional dimensions. Limiting warming to 1.5&#176;C also involves identifying technology and policy levers to accelerate the pace of transformation (see Chapter 4). Some pathways are more consistent than others with the requirements for sustainable development (see Chapter 5). Overall, the three-pronged emphasis on sustainable development, resilience, and transformation provides Chapter 5 an opportunity to assess the conditions of simultaneously reducing societal vulnerabilities, addressing entrenched inequalities, and breaking the circle of poverty.</p>

The current NDCs, extending only to 2030, do not limit warming to 1.5&#176;C. Depending on mitigation decisions after 2030, they cumulatively track toward a warming of 3&#176;-4&#176;C above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100, with the potential for further warming thereafter (Rogelj et al., 2016a; UNFCCC, 2016)<sup id="fnref:r49" class="bf-reference" data-ref="49"><a href="#fn:r49" rel="footnote">49</a></sup>. The analysis of pathways in this report reveals opportunities for greater decoupling of economic growth from GHG emissions. Progress towards limiting warming to 1.5&#176;C requires a significant acceleration of this trend. AR5 concluded that climate change constrains possible development paths, that synergies and trade-offs exist between climate responses and socio-economic contexts, and that opportunities for effective climate responses overlap with opportunities for sustainable development, noting that many existing societal patterns of consumption are intrinsically unsustainable (Fleurbaey et al., 2014)<sup id="fnref:r50" class="bf-reference" data-ref="50"><a href="#fn:r50" rel="footnote">50</a></sup>.</p>

The years 2008&#8211;2013 were characterised by persistent cool conditions in the Eastern Pacific (Kosaka and Xie, 2013; Medhaug et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r83" class="bf-reference" data-ref="83"><a href="#fn:r83" rel="footnote">83</a></sup>, related to both the El Ni&#241;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and, potentially, multi-decadal Pacific variability (e.g., England et al., 2014)<sup id="fnref:r84" class="bf-reference" data-ref="84"><a href="#fn:r84" rel="footnote">84</a></sup>, but these were partially compensated for by El Ni&#241;o conditions in 2006 and 2015. Likewise, volcanic activity depressed temperatures in 1986&#8211;2005, partly offset by the very strong El Ni&#241;o event in 1998. Figure 1.2 indicates that natural variability (internally generated and externally driven) had little net impact on average temperatures over 2006&#8211;2015, in that the average temperature of the decade is similar to the estimated externally driven warming. When solar, volcanic and ENSO-related variability is taken into account following the procedure of Foster and Rahmstorf (2011)<sup id="fnref:r85" class="bf-reference" data-ref="85"><a href="#fn:r85" rel="footnote">85</a></sup>, there is no indication of average temperatures in either 1986&#8211;2005 or 2006&#8211;2015 being substantially biased by short-term variability (see Supplementary Material 1.SM.2). The temperature difference between these two reference periods (0.21&#176;C&#8211;0.27&#176;C over 15 years across available datasets) is also consistent with the AR5 assessment of the current warming rate of 0.3&#176;C&#8211;0.7&#176;C over 30 years (Kirtman et al., 2013)<sup id="fnref:r86" class="bf-reference" data-ref="86"><a href="#fn:r86" rel="footnote">86</a></sup>.</p>

Given this element of extrapolation, we use the AR5 near-term projection to provide a conservative uncertainty range. Combining the uncertainty in observed warming to 1986&#8211;2005 (&#177;0.06&#176;C) with the <em>likely</em> range in the current warming trend as assessed by AR5 (&#177;0.2&#176;C/30 years), assuming these are uncorrelated, and using&#160;observed warming relative to 1850&#8211;1900 to provide the central estimate (no evidence of bias from short-term variability),&#160;gives an assessed warming to the decade 2006&#8211;2015 of 0.87&#176;C with a &#177;0.12&#176;C <em>likely</em>&#160;range. This estimate has the advantage of traceability to the AR5, but more formal methods of quantifying externally driven warming (e.g., Bindoff et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2016; Haustein et al., 2017; Ribes et al., 2017)<sup id="fnref:r87" class="bf-reference" data-ref="87"><a href="#fn:r87" rel="footnote">87</a></sup>, which typically give smaller ranges of uncertainty, may be adopted in the future.</p>

A 1.5&#176;C increase in GMST will be associated with warming substantially greater than 1.5&#176;C in many land regions, and less than 1.5&#176;C in most ocean regions.

Recognizing the very different potential impacts and risks associated with high-overshoot pathways, this report singles out 1.5&#176;C pathways with no or limited (&lt;0.1&#176;C) overshoot in many instances and pursues efforts to ensure that when the term &#8216;1.5&#176;C pathway&#8217; is used, the associated overshoot is made explicit where relevant. In Chapter 2, the classification of pathways is based on one modelling approach to avoid ambiguity, but probabilities of exceeding 1.5&#176;C are checked against other approaches to verify that they lie within this approximate range. All these absolute probabilities are imprecise, depend on the information used to constrain them, and hence are expected to evolve in the future. Imprecise probabilities can nevertheless be useful for decision-making, provided the imprecision is acknowledged (Hall et al., 2007; Kriegler et al., 2009; Simpson et al., 2016)<sup id="fnref:r108" class="bf-reference" data-ref="108"><a href="#fn:r108" rel="footnote">108</a></sup>.

Figure 1.4b demonstrates that pathways remaining below 1.5&#176;C require net annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to peak and decline to near zero or below, depending on the long-term adjustment of the carbon cycle and non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Bowerman et al., 2013; Wigley, 2018)<sup id="fnref:r115" class="bf-reference" data-ref="115"><a href="#fn:r115" rel="footnote">115</a></sup>.

Note that the emissions associated with these schematic temperature pathways may not correspond to feasible emission scenarios, but they do illustrate the fact that the timing of net zero emissions does not in itself determine peak warming: what matters is total cumulative emissions up to that time. Hence every year&#8217;s delay before initiating emission reductions decreases by approximately two years the remaining time available to reach zero emissions on a pathway still remaining below 1.5&#176;C (Allen and Stocker, 2013; Leach et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r117" class="bf-reference" data-ref="117"><a href="#fn:r117" rel="footnote">117</a></sup>.</p>

This allows initially slower or delayed emission reductions, but lowering GMST requires net negative global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (net anthropogenic removal of CO<sub>2</sub>; Figure 1.4b).

</li><li><h2>section-1-3-2-block-1_p4</h2><p id="section-1-3-2-block-1_p4">Sensitivity to changing drivers varies markedly across systems and regions. Impacts of climate change on natural and managed ecosystems can imply loss or increase in growth, biomass or diversity at the level of species populations, interspecific relationships such as pollination, landscapes or entire biomes. Impacts occur in addition to the natural variation in growth, ecosystem dynamics, disturbance, succession and other processes, rendering attribution of impacts at lower levels of warming difficult in certain situations. The same magnitude of warming can be lethal during one phase of the life of an organism and irrelevant during another. Many ecosystems (notably forests, coral reefs and others) undergo long-term successional processes characterised by varying levels of resilience to environmental change over time. Organisms and ecosystems may adapt to environmental change to a certain degree, through changes in physiology, ecosystem structure, species composition or evolution. Large-scale shifts in ecosystems may cause important feedbacks, in terms of changing water and carbon fluxes through impacted ecosystems &#8211; these can amplify or dampen atmospheric change at regional to continental scale. Of particular concern is the response of most of the world&#8217;s forests and seagrass ecosystems, which play key roles as carbon sinks (Settele et al., 2014; Marb&#224; et al., 2015)<sup id="fnref:r225" class="bf-reference" data-ref="225"><a href="#fn:r225" rel="footnote">225</a></sup>.</p>

Climate mitigation&#8211;adaptation linkages, including synergies and trade-offs, are important when considering opportunities and threats for sustainable development. The IPCC AR5 acknowledged that &#8216;adaptation and mitigation have the potential to both contribute to and impede sustainable development, and sustainable development strategies and choices have the potential to both contribute to and impede climate change responses&#8217; (Denton et al., 2014)<sup id="fnref:r240" class="bf-reference" data-ref="240"><a href="#fn:r240" rel="footnote">240</a></sup>.

Mitigation requires the use of new technologies, clean energy sources, reduced deforestation, improved sustainable agricultural methods, and changes in individual and collective behaviour. Many of these may provide substantial co-benefits for air quality, biodiversity and sustainable development. Mal-mitigation includes changes that could reduce emissions in the short-term but could lock in technology choices or practices that include significant trade-offs for effectiveness of future adaptation and other forms of mitigation (Chapters 2 and 4).</p>

The aim is to reduce vulnerability and exposure to the harmful effects of climate change (e.g., sea level rise, more intense extreme weather events or food insecurity). It also includes exploring the potential beneficial opportunities associated with climate change (for example, longer growing seasons or increased yields in some regions). Different adaptation pathways can be undertaken. Adaptation can be incremental, or transformational, meaning fundamental attributes of the system are changed (Chapter 3 and 4). There can be limits to ecosystem-based adaptation or the ability of humans to adapt (Chapter 4). If there is no possibility for adaptive actions that can be applied to avoid an intolerable risk, these are referred to as hard adaptation limits, while soft adaptation limits are identified when there are currently no options to avoid intolerable risks, but they are theoretically possible (Chapter 3 and 4). While climate change is a global issue, impacts are experienced locally.

For example, the deployment of technology and large installations (e.g., renewable or low carbon energy mega-projects) depends upon economic conditions (costs, capacity to mobilize investments for R&amp;D), social or cultural conditions (acceptability), and institutional conditions (political support; e.g., Sovacool et al., 2015)<sup id="fnref:r259" class="bf-reference" data-ref="259"><a href="#fn:r259" rel="footnote">259</a></sup>.

Some dimensions might be more time sensitive or sequential than others (i.e., if conditions are such that it is no longer geophysically feasible to avoid overshooting 1.5&#176;C, the social and institutional feasibility of avoiding overshoot will be no longer relevant). Path dependencies, risks of legacy lock-ins related to existing infrastructures, and possibilities of acceleration permitted by cumulative effects (e.g., dramatic cost decreases driven by learning-by-doing) are all key features to be captured. The effects can play out over various time scales and thus require understanding the connections between near-term (meaning within the next several years to two decades) and long-term implications (meaning over the next several decades) when assessing feasibility conditions.</p>

This means that the conditions for achieving the global transformation required for a 1.5&#176;C world will be heterogeneous and vary according to the specific context. On the other hand, the satisfaction of these conditions may depend upon global-scale drivers, such as international flows of finance, technologies or capacities.

Very high confidence findings must either be supported by a high level of agreement across multiple lines of mutually independent and individually robust lines of evidence or, if only a single line of evidence is available, by a very high level of understanding underlying that evidence.
