The assessment focuses on land regions excluding Antarctica. Changes in marine extremes are addressed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Ocean, Cryosphere and Sea Level Change" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-9">Chapter 9</a> and Cross-Chapter Box 9.1. Assessments of past changes and their drivers are from 1950 onward, unless indicated otherwise. Projections for changes in extremes are presented for different levels of global warming, supplemented with information for the conversion to emissions scenario-based projections (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1 and Table 4.2). Since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), there have been important new developments and knowledge advances on changes in weather and climate extremes, in particular regarding human influence on individual extreme events, on changes in droughts, tropical cyclones, and compound events, and on projections at different global warming levels (1.5°C–4°C). These, together with new evidence at regional scales, provide a stronger basis and more regional information for the AR6 assessment on weather and climate extremes.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">It is an established fact that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have led to an increased frequency and/or intensity of some weather and climate extremes since pre-industrial time, in particular for temperature extremes. </span>Evidence of observed changes in extremes and their attribution to human influence (including greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions and land-use changes) has strengthened since AR5, in particular for extreme precipitation, droughts, tropical cyclones and compound extremes (including dry/hot events and fire weather).

This chapter is also one of the four ‘regional chapters’ of the WGI Report (along with Chapters 10 and 12 and the Atlas).

The IPCC risk framework (Chapter 1) articulates clearly that the exposure and vulnerability to climatic impact-drivers, such as extremes, modulate the risk of adverse impacts of these drivers, and that adaptation which reduces exposure and vulnerability will increase resilience, resulting in a reduction in impacts. Nonetheless, changes in extremes lead to changes in impacts as a direct consequence of changes in their magnitude and frequency, and also through their influence on exposure and resilience.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (referred as the SREX report, IPCC, 2012) provided a comprehensive assessment on changes in extremes and how exposure and vulnerability to extremes determine the impacts and likelihood of disasters. <a class="section-link" data-title="Human Influence on the Climate System" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-3">Chapter 3</a> of that report (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2012">Seneviratne et al., 2012</a>, hereafter also referred to as SREX Chapter 3) assessed physical aspects of extremes, and laid a foundation for the follow-up IPCC assessments.

The definitions of ‘rare’ are wide ranging, depending on applications. Some studies consider an event as an extreme if it is unprecedented; other studies consider events that occur several times a year as moderate extreme events. Rarity of an event with a fixed magnitude also changes under human-induced climate change, making events that are unprecedented so far rather probable under present conditions, but unique in the observational record – and thus often considered as ‘surprises’ (see Box 11.2).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Various approaches are used to define extremes. These are generally based on the determination of relative (e.g., 90<sup class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text-">th</sup> percentile) or absolute (e.g., 35°C for a hot day) thresholds above which conditions are considered extremes. Changes in extremes can be examined from two perspectives, either focusing on changes in frequency of given extremes, or on changes in their intensity.

The drought assessment addresses meteorological droughts, agricultural and ecological droughts, and hydrological droughts (see Glossary). The storms assessment addresses tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, and severe convective storms. This chapter also assesses changes in compound events – that is, multivariate or concurrent extreme events – because of their relevance to impacts as well as the emergence of new literature on the subject. Most of the considered extremes were also assessed in SREX and AR5. Compound events were not assessed in depth in past IPCC reports (SREX Chapter 3; <a class="section-link" data-title="Compound Events " href="#11.8">Section 11.8</a> of this Report). Marine-related extremes such as marine heatwaves and extreme sea level, are assessed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Extreme Sea Levels: Tides, Surges and Waves" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-9#9.6.4">Section 9.6.4</a> and Box 9.2 of this Report.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Extremes and related phenomena are of various spatial and temporal scales. Tornadoes have a spatial scale as small as less than 100 metres and a temporal scale as short as a few minutes. In contrast, a drought can last for multiple years, affecting vast regions. The level of complexity of the involved processes differs from one type of extreme to another, affecting our capability to detect, attribute and project changes in weather and climate extremes. Temperature and precipitation extremes studied in the literature are often based on extremes derived from daily values. Studies of events on longer time scales for temperature or precipitation, or on sub-daily extremes, are scarcer, which generally limits the assessment for such events. Nevertheless, extremes on time scales different from daily are assessed for temperature extremes and heavy precipitation, when possible (Sections 11.3 and 11.4). Droughts and tropical cyclones are treated as phenomena in general in the assessment, not limited by their extreme forms, because these phenomena are relevant to impacts (Sections 11.6 and 11.7). Both precipitation and wind extremes associated with storms are considered.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Multiple concomitant extremes can lead to stronger impacts than those resulting from the same extremes had they happened in isolation.

Also, this is useful for decision makers as actionable information, as much of the mitigation policy discussion and adaptation planning can be tied to the level of global warming. For example, regional changes in extremes, and thus their impacts, can be linked to global mitigation efforts. There is also the advantage of separating uncertainty in future projections due to regional responses as a function of global warming levels from other factors such as differences in global climate sensitivity and emissions scenarios (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1).

As a result, they are also important to the magnitude, frequency, and duration of extremes (Box 11.4). Aspects of changes in large-scale circulation patterns are assessed in Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 8, and representative atmospheric and oceanic modes are described in Annex IV. This subsection provides some general concepts, through a couple of examples, on why the uncertainty in the response of large-scale circulation patterns to external forcing can cascade to uncertainty in the response of extremes to external forcings. Details for specific types of extremes are covered in the relevant subsections. For example, the occurrence of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences precipitation regimes in many areas, favouring droughts in some regions and heavy rains in others (Box 11.4). The extent and strength of the Hadley circulation influences regions where tropical and extratropical cyclones occur, with important consequences for the characteristics of extreme precipitation, drought, and winds (<a class="section-link" data-title="Extreme Storms" href="#11.7">Section 11.7</a>). Changes in circulation patterns associated with land–ocean heat contrast, which affect the monsoon circulations (<a class="section-link" data-title="Monsoons" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-8#8.4.2.4">Section 8.4.2.4</a>), lead to heavy precipitation along the coastal regions in East Asia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Freychet--2015">Freychet et al., 2015</a>). As a result, changes in the spatial and/or temporal variability of the atmospheric circulation in response to warming affect characteristics of weather systems such as tropical cyclones (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sharmila--2018">Sharmila and Walsh, 2018</a>), storm tracks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shaw--2016">Shaw et al., 2016</a>), and atmospheric rivers (<a class="section-link" data-title="Extreme Storms" href="#11.7">Section 11.7</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Waliser--2017">Waliser and Guan, 2017</a>). Changes in weather systems come with changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme winds, extreme temperatures, and extreme precipitation, on the backdrop of thermodynamic responses of extremes to warming (Box 11.1). Floods are also affected by large-scale circulation modes, including ENSO, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV), and the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kundzewicz--2018">Kundzewicz et al., 2018</a>; Annex IV). Aerosol forcing, through changes in patterns of sea surface temperatures (SSTs), also affects circulation patterns and tropical cyclone activities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Takahashi--2017">Takahashi et al., 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In general, changes in atmospheric large-scale circulation due to external forcing are uncertain, but there are some robust changes (Sections 2.3.1.4 and 8.2.2.2).

This includes effects of land management (e.g., cropland intensification, irrigation, double cropping) as well as of land cover changes (deforestation; Sections 11.3.2 and 11.6). Some of these processes are not well represented (e.g., effects of forest cover on diurnal temperature cycle) or not integrated (e.g., irrigation) in climate models (Sections 11.3.2 and 11.3.3). Overall, the effects of land-use forcing may be particularly relevant in the context of low-emissions scenarios, which include large land-use modifications, for instance those associated with the expansion of biofuels, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or re-/afforestation to ensure negative emissions, as well as with the expansion of food production (e.g., SR1.5, Chapter 3; Cross-Chapter Box 5.1 in this Report; <a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Vuuren--2011">van Vuuren et al., 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hirsch--2018">Hirsch et al., 2018</a>).

From around the 1950s to 1980s, enhanced aerosol loadings led to regional cooling due to decreased global solar radiation (‘global dimming’) which was followed by a phase of ‘global brightening’ due to a reduction in aerosol loadings (Chapters 3 and 7; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wild--2005">Wild et al., 2005</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#King--2016b">King et al. (2016b)</a> show that aerosol-induced cooling delayed the timing of a significant human contribution to record-breaking heat extremes in some regions. However, the decreased aerosol loading since the 1990s has led to an accelerated warming of hot extremes in some regions. Based on Earth system model (ESM) simulations, <a class="reference-link" href="#Dong--2017">Dong et al.

In particular, soil moisture feedbacks play an important role for extremes in several mid-latitude regions, leading to a marked additional warming of hot extremes compared to mean global warming (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2016">Seneviratne et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bathiany--2018">Bathiany et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Miralles--2019">Miralles et al., 2019</a>), which is superimposed on the known land–sea contrast in mean warming (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vogel--2017">Vogel et al., 2017</a>). Soil moisture–atmosphere feedbacks also affect drought development (<a class="section-link" data-title="Droughts" href="#11.6">Section 11.6</a>). Additionally, effects of land surface conditions on circulation patterns have also been reported (<a class="reference-link" href="#Koster--2016">Koster et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sato--2019">Sato and Nakamura, 2019</a>). These regional feedbacks are also associated with substantial spread in models (<a class="section-link" data-title="Temperature Extremes" href="#11.3">Section 11.3</a>), and contribute to the identified higher spread of regional projections of temperature extremes as a function of global warming, compared with the spread resulting from the differences in projected global warming (global transient climate responses) in climate models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2020">Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020</a>). In addition, there are also feedbacks between soil moisture content and precipitation occurrence, generally characterized by negative spatial feedbacks and positive local feedbacks (Taylor et al., 2012; <a class="reference-link" href="#Guillod--2015">Guillod et al., 2015</a>). Climate model projections suggest that these feedbacks are relevant for projected changes in heavy precipitation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2013">Seneviratne et al., 2013</a>). However, there is evidence that climate models do not capture the correct sign of the soil moisture–precipitation feedbacks in several regions, in particular spatially, and/or in some cases also temporally (Taylor et al., 2012; <a class="reference-link" href="#Moon--2019">Moon et al., 2019</a>). In the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, the snow- and ice-albedo feedback, along with other factors, is projected to largely amplify temperature increases (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Pithan--2014">Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014</a>), although the effect on temperature extremes is still unclear.

Such events are often not anticipated and thus sometimes referred to as ‘surprises’. There are several types of LLHI events. Abrupt changes in mean climate are addressed in Chapter 4. Unanticipated LLHI events can either result from tipping points in the climate system (<a class="section-link" data-title="Abrupt Change, Tipping Points and Surprises" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.4.4.3">Section 1.4.4.3</a>), such as the shutdown of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (SROCC Chapter 6; <a class="reference-link" href="#Collins--2019">Collins et al., 2019</a>) or the drydown of the Amazonian rainforest (SR1.5 Chapter 3, <a class="reference-link" href="#Hoegh-Guldberg--2018">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Drijfhout--2015">Drijfhout et al., 2015</a>), or from uncertainties in climate processes, including climate feedbacks, that may enhance or damp extremes either related to global or regional climate responses (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2018a">Seneviratne et al., 2018a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sutton--2018">Sutton, 2018</a>). The <i class="•-Condensed-italic">low confidence</i> does not by itself exclude the possibility of such events occuring, rather it indicates a poor state of knowledge. Such outcomes, while improbable, could be associated with very high impacts, and are thus highly relevant from a risk perspective (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Sources of Uncertainty in Climate Simulations" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.4.3">Section 1.4.3</a> and Box 11.4; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sutton--2018">Sutton, 2018</a>, 2019). Alternatively, high impacts can occur when different extremes occur at the same time, or in short succession at the same location, or in several regions with shared vulnerability (e.g., food-basket regions <a class="reference-link" href="#Gaupp--2019">Gaupp et al., 2019</a>). These ‘compound events’ are assessed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Compound Events " href="#11.8">Section 11.8</a>, and Box 11.4 provides a case study example.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Difficulties persist in determining the likelihood of occurrence and time frame of potential tipping points and LLHI events. However, new literature has emerged on unanticipated and LLHI events. There are some events that are sufficiently rare that they have not been observed in meteorological records, but whose occurrence is nonetheless plausible within the current state of the climate system – see examples below and in <a class="reference-link" href="#McCollum--2020">McCollum et al. (2020)</a>. The rare nature of such events and the limited availability of relevant data makes it difficult to estimate their occurrence probability and thus gives little evidence on whether to include such hypothetical events in planning decisions and risk assessments. The estimation of such potential surprises is often limited to events that have historical analogues (including before the instrumental records began, <a class="reference-link" href="#Wetter--2014">Wetter et al., 2014</a>), albeit the magnitude of the event may differ. Additionally, there is also a limitation of available resources to exhaust all plausible trajectories of the climate system. As a result, there will still be events that cannot be anticipated. These events can be surprises to many in that the events have not been experienced, although their occurrence could be inferred by statistical means or physical modelling approaches (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2017">Chen et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Oldenborgh--2017">van Oldenborgh et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Harrington--2018a">Harrington and Otto, 2018a</a>). Another approach focusing on the estimation of low-probability events and of events whose likelihood of occurrence is unknown consists in using physical climate models to create a physically self-consistent storyline of plausible extreme events and assessing their impacts and driving factors in past (<a class="section-link" data-title="Attribution of Extremes" href="#11.2.3">Section 11.2.3</a>) or future conditions (<a class="section-link" data-title="Projecting Changes in Extremes as a Function of Global Warming Levels " href="#11.2.4">Section 11.2.4</a>)<span lang="en-US"> (Hazeleger</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2016">Shepherd, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zappa--2017">Zappa and Shepherd, 2017</a>; Cheng</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2018; Shepherd</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sutton--2018">Sutton, 2018</a>; Schaller</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2020; Wehrli</span><span lang="en-US"> et al., 2020)</span>.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">In many parts of the world, observational data are limited to 50–60 years. This means that the chance to observe an extreme event at a particular location that occurs once in several hundred or more years is small. Thus, when a very extreme event occurs, it becomes a surprise to many (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bao--2017">Bao et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McCollum--2020">McCollum et al., 2020</a>), and very rare events are often associated with high impacts<span lang="nb-NO">(van Oldenborgh</span><span lang="nb-NO">et al. </span><span lang="nb-NO">, 2017; Philip</span><span lang="nb-NO">et al. </span><span lang="nb-NO">, 2018b; Tozer</span><span lang="nb-NO">et al. </span><span lang="nb-NO">, 2020). </span>Attributing and projecting very rare events in a particular location by assessing their likelihood of occurrence within the same larger region and climate thus provides another way to make quantitative assessments regarding events that are extremely rare locally. Some examples of such events include:</p><ul><li class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-bullets---cont--no-space-above-" lang="en-GB">Hurricane Harvey, that made landfall in Houston, TX in August 2017 (<a class="section-link" data-title="Detection and Attribution, Event Attribution" href="#11.7.1.4">Section 11.7.1.4</a>.)</li><li class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-bullets---cont--no-space-above-" lang="en-GB">The 2010–2011 extreme floods in Queensland, Australia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Christidis--2013a">Christidis et al., 2013a</a>)</li><li class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-bullets---cont--no-space-above-" lang="en-GB">The 2018 concurrent heatwaves across the Northern Hemisphere (Box 11.4)</li><li class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-bullets---cont--no-space-above-" lang="en-GB">Tropical Cyclone Idai in Mozambique (Cross-Chapter Box: Disaster in WGII AR6 Chapter 4)</li><li class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-bullets---cont--no-space-above-" lang="en-GB">The California fires in 2018 and 2019</li><li class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-bullets---cont--no-space-above- ParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">The 2019–2020 Australia fires (Cross-Chapter Box: Disaster in WGII AR6 Chapter 4)</li></ul><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">One factor making such events hard to anticipate is the fact that we now live in a non-stationary climate, and that the framework of reference for adaptation is continuously moving. As an example, the concurrent heatwaves that occurred across the Northern Hemisphere in the summer of 2018 were considered very unusual and were unprecedented given the total area that was concurrently affected<span lang="nb-NO">(Drouard</span><span lang="nb-NO">et al. </span><span lang="nb-NO">, 2019; Kornhuber</span><span lang="nb-NO">et al. </span><span lang="nb-NO">, 2019; Toreti</span><span lang="nb-NO">et al. </span><span lang="nb-NO">, 2019; Vogel</span><span lang="nb-NO">et al. </span><span lang="nb-NO">, 2019)</span>; however, the probability of this event under 1°C global warming was found to be about 16% (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vogel--2019">Vogel et al., 2019</a>), which is not particularly low. Similarly, the 2013 summer temperature over eastern China was the hottest on record at the time, but it had an estimated recurrence interval of about four years in the climate of 2013 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sun--2014">Sun et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, when other aspects of the risk, vulnerability, and exposure are historically high or have recently increased (see WGII, Chapter 16, Section 16.4), relatively moderate extremes can have very high impacts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Otto--2015b">Otto et al., 2015b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Philip--2018b">Philip et al., 2018b</a>). As warming continues, the climate moves further away from its historical state we are familiar with, resulting in an increased likelihood of unprecedented events and surprises. This is particularly the case under high global warming levels – for example, the climate of the late 21st century under high-emissions scenarios, above 4°C of global warming (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Another factor highlighted in <a class="section-link" data-title="Compound Events " href="#11.8">Section 11.8</a> and Box 11.4 making events high-impact and difficult to anticipate is that several locations under moderate warming levels could be affected simultaneously, or very repeatedly by different types of extremes (Mora et al., 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gaupp--2019">Gaupp et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Vogel--2019">Vogel et al., 2019</a>). Box 11.4 shows that concurrent events at different locations, which can lead to major impacts across the world, can also result from the combination of anomalous circulation or natural variability (e.g., El Niño–Southern Oscillation) patterns with amplification of resulting responses to human-induced global warming. Also multivariate extremes at single locations pose specific challenges to anticipation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Compound Events " href="#11.8">Section 11.8</a>), with low likelihoods in the current climate but the probability of occurrence of such compound events strongly increasing with increasing global warming levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vogel--2020a">Vogel et al., 2020a</a>). Therefore, in order to estimate whether, and at what level of global warming, very high impacts arising from extremes would occur, the spatial extent of extremes and the potential of compounding extremes need to be assessed. Sections 11.3, 11.4, 11.7 and 11.8 highlight increasing evidence that temperature extremes, higher intensity precipitation accompanying tropical cyclones, and compound events such as dry/hot conditions conducive to wildfire or storm surges resulting from sea level rise and heavy precipitation events, pose widespread threats to societies already at relatively low warming levels. Studies have already shown that the probability for some recent extreme events is so small in the undisturbed world that these events were <i class="•-Condensed-italic">extremely unlikely </i> to occur without human influence (<a class="section-link" data-title="Projecting Changes in Extremes as a Function of Global Warming Levels " href="#11.2.4">Section 11.2.4</a>). Box 11.2, Table 1, provides examples of projected changes in LLHI extremes (single extremes, compound events) of potential relevance for impact and adaptation assessments showing that today’s very rare events can become commonplace in a warmer future.</p><div class="Basic-Text-Frame" id="_idContainer031"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-Figure-title table-fix" lang="en-GB"><strong

The thresholds have been defined in different ways, leading to differences in the meaning of extremes that may share the same name. For example, two sets of metrics for the frequency of hot/warm days have been used in the literature. One set counts the number of days when maximum daily temperature is above a relative threshold defined as the 90th or higher percentile of maximum daily temperature for the calendar day over a base period. An event based on such a definition can occur at any time of the year, and the impact of such an event would differ depending on the season. The other set counts the number of days in which maximum daily temperature is above an absolute threshold such as 35°C, because exceeding this temperature can sometimes cause health impacts (however, these impacts may depend on location and whether ecosystems and the population are adapted to such temperatures). While both types of hot extreme indices have been used to analyse changes in the frequency of hot/warm events, they represent different events that occur at different times of the year, possibly affected by different types of processes and mechanisms, and possibly also associated with different impacts.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Changes in extremes have also been examined from two perspectives: changes in the frequency for a given magnitude of extremes; or changes in the magnitude for a particular return period (frequency). Changes in the probability of extremes (e.g., temperature extremes) depend on the rarity of the extreme event that is assessed, with a larger change in probability associated with a rarer event (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Kharin--2018">Kharin et al., 2018</a>). However, changes in the magnitude represented by the return levels of the extreme events may not be as sensitive to the rarity of the event. While the answers to the two different questions are related, their relevance may differ for distinct audiences. Conclusions regarding the respective contribution of greenhouse gas forcing to changes in magnitude versus frequency of extremes may also differ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Otto--2012">Otto et al., 2012</a>). Correspondingly, the sensitivity of changes in extremes to increasing global warming is also dependent on the definition of the considered extremes. In the case of temperature extremes, changes in magnitude have been shown to often depend linearly on global surface temperature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2016">Seneviratne et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wartenburger--2017">Wartenburger et al., 2017</a>), while changes in frequency tend to be nonlinear and can, for example, be exponential for increasing global warming levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fischer--2015">Fischer and Knutti, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kharin--2018">Kharin et al., 2018</a>). When similar damage occurs once a fixed threshold is exceeded, it is more important to ask a question regarding changes in the frequency. But when the exceedance of this fixed threshold becomes a normal occurrence in the future, this can lead to a saturation in the change of probability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Harrington--2018a">Harrington and Otto, 2018a</a>). Also, if the impact of an event increases with the intensity of the event, it would be more relevant to examine changes in the magnitude. Finally, adaptation to climate change might change the relevant thresholds over time, although such aspects are still rarely integrated in the assessment of projected changes in extremes. Framing is considered when forming the assessments of this Chapter, including how extremes are defined and how the questions are asked in the literature <i class="•-Condensed-italic">. </i></p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="11.2.2"><h2 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">11.2.2 Data<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-19-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Studies of past and future changes in weather and climate extremes, and in the mean state of the climate, use the same original sources of weather and climate observations, including in situ observations, remotely sensed data, and derived data products such as reanalyses. Sections 2.3 and 10.2 assess various aspects of these data sources and data products from the perspective of their general use, and in the analysis of changes in the mean state of the climate in particular. Building on these previous chapters, this subsection highlights particular aspects that are related to extremes and are most relevant to the assessment of this Chapter. The SREX (Chapter 3, <a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2012">Seneviratne et al., 2012</a>) and AR5 (Chapter 2, <a class="reference-link" href="#Hartmann--2013">Hartmann et al., 2013</a>) addressed critical issues regarding the quality and availability of observed data and their relevance for the assessment of changes in extremes.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Extreme weather and climate events occur on time scales of hours (e.g., convective storms that produce heavy precipitation) to days (e.g., tropical cyclones, heatwaves), to seasons and years (e.g., droughts). A robust determination of long-term changes in these events can have different requirements for the spatial and temporal scales and sample size of the data. In general, it is more difficult to determine long-term changes for events of fairly large temporal duration, such as ‘megadroughts’ that last several years or longer (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Ault--2014">Ault et al., 2014</a>), because of the limitations of the observational sample size. Literature that studies changes in extreme precipitation and temperature often uses indices representing specifics of extremes that are derived from daily precipitation and temperature values. Station-based indices would have the same issues as those for the mean climate regarding the quality, availability, and homogeneity of the data. For the purpose of constructing regional information and/or for comparison with model outputs, such as model evaluation, and detection and attribution, these station-based indices are often interpolated onto regular grids. Two different approaches, involving two different orders of operation, have been used in producing such gridded datasets.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In some cases, such as for the HadEX3 dataset (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dunn--2020">Dunn et al., 2020</a>), indices of extremes are computed using time series directly derived from stations first, and are then gridded over the space. As the indices are computed at the station level, the gridded data products represent point estimates of the indices averaged over the spatial scale of the grid box. In other instances, daily values of station observations are first gridded (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Contractor--2020a">Contractor et al., 2020a</a>), and the interpolated values can then be used to compute various indices. Depending on the station density, values for extremes computed from data gridded this way represent extremes of spatial scales anywhere from the size of the grid box to a point. In regions with high station density (e.g., North America, Europe), the gridded values are closer to extremes of area means and are thus more appropriate for comparisons with extremes estimated from climate model output, which is often considered to represent areal means (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2008">Chen and Knutson, 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gervais--2014">Gervais et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Avila--2015">Avila et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Di%20Luca--2020b">Di Luca et al., 2020b</a>). In regions with very limited station density (e.g., Africa), the gridded values are closer to point estimates of extremes. The difference in spatial scales among observational data products and model simulations needs to be carefully accounted for when interpreting the comparison among different data products. For example, the average annual maximum daily maximum temperature (TXx) over land computed from the original ERA-Interim reanalysis (at 0.75° resolution) is about 0.4°C warmer than that computed when the ERA-Interim dataset is upscaled to the resolution of 2.5° × 3.75° (<a class="reference-link" href="#Di%20Luca--2020">Di Luca et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Extreme indices computed from various reanalysis data products have been used in some studies, but reanalysis extreme statistics have not been rigorously compared to observations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Donat--2016a">Donat et al., 2016a</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In general, changes in temperature extremes from various reanalyses were most consistent with gridded observations after about 1980, but larger differences were found during the pre-satellite era (<a class="reference-link" href="#Donat--2014b">Donat et al., 2014b</a>). Overall, lower agreement across reanalysis datasets was found for extreme precipitation changes, although temporal and spatial correlations against observations were found to be still significant. In regions with sparse observations (e.g., Africa and parts of South America), there is generally less agreement for extreme precipitation between different reanalysis products, indicating a consequence of the lack of an observational constraint in these regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Donat--2014b">Donat et al., 2014b</a>, 2016a). More recent reanalyses, such as ERA5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hersbach--2020">Hersbach et al., 2020</a>), seem to have improved over previous products, at least over some regions (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Mahto--2019">Mahto and Mishra, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gleixner--2020">Gleixner et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sheridan--2020">Sheridan et al., 2020</a>). Caution is needed when reanalysis data products are used to provide additional information about past changes in these extremes in regions where observations are generally lacking.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">Satellite remote sensing data have been used to provide information about precipitation extremes because several products provide data at sub-daily resolution for precipitation, for example, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM; <a class="reference-link" href="#Maggioni--2016">Maggioni et al., 2016</a>) and clouds, for example, Himawari (Bessho et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2019">Chen et al., 2019</a>). However, satellites do not observe the primary atmospheric state variables directly and polar orbiting satellites do not observe any given place at all times. Hence, their utility as a substitute for high-frequency (i.e., daily) ground-based observations is limited. For instance, <a class="reference-link" href="#Timmermans--2019">Timmermans et al. (2019)</a> found little relationship between the timing of extreme daily and five-day precipitation in satellite and gridded station data products over the USA.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-11.3"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-heading" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 11.3 | Extremes in Paleoclimate Archives Compared to Instrumental Records</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-20-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Examining extremes in pre-instrumental information can help to put events occurring in the instrumental record (referred to as ‘observed’) in a longer-term context.

This box provides overviews of: (i) AR5 assessments; (ii) types of evidence assessed here; evidence of: (iii) droughts; (iv) temperature extremes; (v) paleofloods; and (vi) paleotempests; and (vii) a summary.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">(<a class="section-link" data-title="Global Carbon and other Biogeochemical Cycles and Feedbacks" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-5">Chapter 5</a> of AR5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Masson-Delmotte--2013">Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013</a>) concluded with <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> that droughts of greater magnitude and of longer duration than those observed in the instrumental period occurred in many regions during the preceding millennium.

While AR5 assessed 20th century summer temperatures compared to those reconstructed in the Common Era, it did not assess shorter duration temperature extremes.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Many factors affect confidence in information on pre-instrumental extremes. First, the geographical coverage of paleoclimate reconstructions of extremes is not spatially uniform (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smerdon--2016">Smerdon and Pollack, 2016</a>) and depends on both the availability of archives and records, which are environmentally dependent, and also the differing attention and focus from the scientific community. In Australia, for example, the paleoclimate network is sparser than for other regions, such as Asia, Europe and North America, and synthesized products rely on remote proxies and assumptions about the spatial coherence of precipitation between remote climates (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cook--2016c">Cook et al., 2016c</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Freund--2017">Freund et al., 2017</a>). Second, pre-instrumental evidence of extremes may be focused on understanding archetypal extreme events, such as the climatic consequences of the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, Indonesia (Veale and Endfield, 2016). These studies provide narrow evidence of extremes in response to specific forcings (M. <a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2017"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2017"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2017"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2017">Li et al., 2017</a>) for specific epochs. Third, natural archives may provide information about extremes in one season only and may not represent all extremes of the same types.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Evidence of shorter duration extreme event types, such as floods and tropical storms, is further restricted by the comparatively low chronological controls and temporal resolution (e.g., monthly, seasonal, yearly, multiple years) of most archives compared to the events (e.g., minutes to days). Natural archives may be sensitive only to intense environmental disturbances, and so only sporadically record short-duration or small spatial-scale extremes. Interpreting sedimentary records as evidence of past short-duration extremes is also complex and requires a clear understanding of natural processes<span lang="en-US"> (Wilhelm</span><span lang="en-US"> et al. </span><span lang="en-US">, 2019)</span>. For example, paleoflood reconstructions of flood recurrence and intensity produced from geological evidence (e.g., river and lake sediments), speleothems (<a class="reference-link" href="#Denniston--2017">Denniston and Luetscher, 2017</a>), botanical evidence (e.g., flood damage to trees, or tree ring reconstructions), and floral and faunal evidence (e.g., diatom fossil assemblages) require understanding of sediment sources and flood mechanisms. Pre-instrumental records of tropical storm intensity and frequency (also called paleotempest records) derived from overwash deposits of coastal lake and marsh sediments are difficult to interpret. Many factors have an impact on whether disturbances are deposited in archives (<a class="reference-link" href="#Muller--2017">Muller et al., 2017</a>) and deposits may provide sporadic and incomplete preservation histories (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Tamura--2018">Tamura et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Overall, the most complete pre-instrumental evidence of extremes occurs for long-duration, large spatial-scale extremes, such as for multi-year meteorological droughts or seasonal- and regional-scale temperature extremes. Additionally, more precise insights into recent extremes emerge where multiple studies have been undertaken, compared to the confidence in extremes reported at single sites or in single studies, which may not necessarily be representative of large-scale changes, or for reconstructions that synthesize multiple proxies over large areas (e.g., drought atlases). Multiproxy synthesis products combine paleoclimate temperature reconstructions and cover sub-continental- to hemispheric-scale regions to provide continuous records of the Common Era<span lang="nb-NO">(e.g., Ahmed</span><span lang="nb-NO">et al. </span><span lang="nb-NO">, 2013; Neukom</span><span lang="nb-NO">et al. </span><span lang="nb-NO">, 2014 fo</span><span lang="nb-NO">r temperature). </span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">There is <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> in the occurrence of long-duration and severe drought events during the Common Era for many locations, although their severity compared to recent drought events differs between locations and the lengths of reconstruction provided.

Such an occurrence is not, in itself, evidence of a change, or lack of a change, in the magnitude or the likelihood of extremes in the past or in the instrumental period at regional and local scales. Yet, the systematic collection of paleoclimate records over wide areas may provide evidence of changes in extremes.

A general overview and summary of methods of attribution science is provided in the Cross-Working Group Box 1.1. Trend detection using optimal fingerprinting methods is a well-established field, and has been assessed in AR5 (Chapter 10, <a class="reference-link" href="#Bindoff--2013">Bindoff et al., 2013</a>), and <a class="section-link" data-title="Methods Based on Regression" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-3#3.2.1">Section 3.2.1</a> of this Report. There are specific challenges when applying optimal fingerprinting to the detection and attribution of trends in extremes and on regional scales where the lower signal-to-noise ratio is a challenge. In particular, the method generally requires the data to follow a Normal (Gaussian) distribution, which is often not the case for extremes. However, recent studies showed that extremes can be transformed to a Gaussian distribution, for example, by averaging over space, so that optimal fingerprinting techniques can still be used (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wen--2013">Wen et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2013">Zhang et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wan--2019">Wan et al., 2019</a>). Non-stationary extreme value distributions, which allow for the detailed detection and attribution of regional trends in temperature extremes, have also been used (Z. <a class="reference-link" href="#Wang--2017"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Wang--2017">Wang et al., 2017</a>a).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Apart from the detection and attribution of trends in extremes, new approaches have been developed to answer the question of whether, and to what extent, external drivers have altered the probability and intensity of an individual extreme event (<a class="reference-link" href="#NASEM--2016">NASEM, 2016</a>). In AR5, there was an emerging consensus that the role of external drivers of climate change in specific extreme weather events could be estimated and quantified in principle, but related assessments were still confined to particular case studies, often using a single model, and typically focusing on high-impact events with a clear attributable signal.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">However, since AR5, the attribution of extreme weather events has emerged as a growing field of climate research with an increasing body of literature (see series of supplements to the annual State of the Climate report (<a class="reference-link" href="#Peterson--2012">Peterson et al., 2012</a>, 2013a; <a class="reference-link" href="#Herring--2014">Herring et al., 2014</a>, 2015, 2016, 2018), including the number of approaches to examining extreme events(described in <a class="reference-link" href="#Easterling--2016">Easterling et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Otto--2017">Otto, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Stott--2016">Stott et al., 2016</a>)). A commonly used approach – often called the risk-based approach in the literature, and referred to here as the ‘probability-based approach’ – produces statements such as ‘anthropogenic climate change made this event type twice as likely ’ or ‘anthropogenic climate change made this event 15% more intense’. This is done by estimating probability distributions of the index characterizing the event in today’s climate, as well as in a counterfactual climate, and either comparing intensities for a given occurrence probability (e.g., 1-in-100-year event) or probabilities for a given magnitude (see FAQ 11.3). There are a number of different analytical methods encompassed in the probability-based approach, building on observations and statistical analyses (e.g., van Oldenborgh et al., 2012), optimal fingerprint methods (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sun--2014">Sun et al., 2014</a>), regional climate and weather forecast models (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Schaller--2016">Schaller et al., 2016</a>), global climate models (GCMs) (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Lewis--2013">Lewis and Karoly, 2013</a>), and large ensembles of atmosphere-only GCMs (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Lott--2013">Lott et al., 2013</a>). A key component in any event attribution analysis is the level of conditioning on the state of the climate system. In the least conditional approach, the combined effect of the overall warming and changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation are considered and often utilize fully coupled climate models (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sun--2014">Sun et al., 2014</a>). Other more conditional approaches involve prescribing certain aspects of the climate system. These range from prescribing the pattern of the surface ocean change at the time of the event (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Hoerling--2013">Hoerling et al., 2013</a>, 2014), often using Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) style global models, where the choice of sea surface temperature and ice patterns influences the attribution results (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sparrow--2018">Sparrow et al., 2018</a>), to prescribing the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere and using weather forecasting models or methods (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Pall--2017">Pall et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Patricola--2018">Patricola and Wehner, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wehner--2018a">Wehner et al., 2018a</a>). These highly conditional approaches have also been called ‘storylines’ (Cross-Working Group Box 1.1; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2016">Shepherd, 2016</a>) and can be useful when applied to extreme events that are too rare to otherwise analyse, or where the specific atmospheric conditions were central to the impact. These methods are also used to enable the use of very high-resolution simulations in cases were lower-resolution models do not simulate the regional atmospheric dynamics well (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2016">Shepherd, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2018">Shepherd et al., 2018</a>). However, the imposed conditions limit an overall assessment of the anthropogenic influence on an event, as the fixed aspects of the analysis may also have been affected by climate change. For instance, the specified initial conditions in the highly conditional hindcast attribution approach often applied to tropical cyclones (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Takayabu--2015">Takayabu et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Patricola--2018">Patricola and Wehner, 2018</a>) permit only a conditional statement about the magnitude of the storm if similar large-scale meteorological patterns could have occurred in a world without climate change, thus precluding any attribution statement about the change in frequency if used in isolation. Combining conditional assessments of changes in the intensity with a multi-model approach does allow for the latter as well (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2016">Shepherd, 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The outcome of event attribution is dependent on the definition of the event (<a class="reference-link" href="#Leach--2020">Leach et al., 2020</a>), as well as the framing (<a class="reference-link" href="#Otto--2016">Otto et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Christidis--2018">Christidis et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#J%C3%A9z%C3%A9quel--2018">Jézéquel et al., 2018</a>) and uncertainties in observations and modelling.

In addition, the use of global warming levels in the context of global policy documents – in particular the 2015 Paris Agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2016">UNFCCC, 2016</a>) implies that information on changes in the climate system, and specifically extremes, as a function of global warming are of particular policy relevance.

If the interest is in the projection of regional changes at certain GWLs, such as those defined by the Paris Agreement, projections based on time periods and emissions scenarios have unnecessarily larger uncertainty due to differences in model global transient climate responses. To take advantage of this feature and to provide easy comparison with SR1.5, assessments of projected changes in this chapter are largely provided in relation to future GWLs, with a focus on changes at +1.5°C, +2°C, and +4°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels (e.g., Tables 11.1 and 11.2 and regional tables in <a class="section-link" data-title="Regional Information on Extremes" href="#11.9">Section 11.9</a>). These encompass a scenario compatible with the lowest limit of the Paris Agreement (+1.5°C), a scenario slightly overshooting the aims of the Paris Agreement (+2°C), and a ‘worst-case’ scenario with no mitigation (+4°C). Cross-Chapter Box 11.1 provides a background on the GWL sampling approach used in AR6, for the computation of GWL projections from climate models contributing to Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) as well as for the mapping of existing scenario-based literature for CMIP6 and the CMIP Phase 5 (CMIP5) to assessments as function of GWLs (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Regional Information on Extremes" href="#11.9">Section 11.9</a>. and Table 11.3 for an example).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">While regional changes in many types of extremes do scale robustly with global surface temperature, generally irrespective of emissions scenarios (<a class="section-link" data-title="Effects of Greenhouse Gas and Other External Forcings on Extremes" href="#11.1.4">Section 11.1.4</a>, Figures 11.3, 11.6 and 11.7 and Cross-Chapter Box 11.1), effects of local forcing can distort this relation.

This is consistent with conclusions from the SR1.5 (<a class="section-link" data-title="Human Influence on the Climate System" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-3">Chapter 3</a> for less-rare temperature extremes (TXx on the yearly time scale), which shows that a difference as small as 0.5°C of global warming – for example, between +1.5°C and +2°C of global warming – leads to detectable differences in temperature extremes in TXx in most WGI AR6 regions in CMIP5 projections (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Wartenburger--2017">Wartenburger et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2018b">Seneviratne et al., 2018b</a>).

Recently, quantifying global and regional climate at specific global warming levels (GWLs) has become widespread, motivated by the inclusion of explicit GWLs in the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement (<a class="section-link" data-title="Global Warming Levels" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1#1.6.2">Section 1.6.2</a>). GWLs, expressed as changes in global surface temperature relative to the 1850–1900 period (see Cross-Chapter Box 2.3), are used in SR1.5 and in the assessment of Reasons for Concerns in the WGII reports (see also Cross-Chapter Box 12.1). Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Figure 1 illustrates how the assessment of the climate response at GWLs relates to the uncertainty in scenarios regarding the timing of the respective GWLs, as well as to the uncertainty in the associated regional climate responses, including extremes and other climatic impact-drivers (CIDs). For many (but not all) climate variables and CIDs, the response pattern for a given GWL is consistent across different scenarios (Chapters 1, 4, 9, 11 and Atlas). GWLs are defined as long-term means (e.g., 20-year averages) compared to the pre-industrial period, are commonly used in the literature, and were also underlying main assessments of SR1.5 (Chapter 3).</p><div class="Basic-Text-Frame" id="_idContainer038"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-Figure-title" lang="en-GB"><strong class="IPCC_•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-15" id="ccbox-11-1-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_CCBox_11_1_Figure_1.png"></span></strong></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-Figure-title" lang="en-GB"><strong class="IPCC_•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Figure 1 | </span></strong><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Schematic representation of relationship between emissions scenarios, global warming levels (GWLs), regional climate responses, and impacts. </span> The illustration shows the implied uncertainty problem associated with differentiating between 1.5°C, 2°C, and other GWLs.

It is therefore useful even for metrics that do not show a linear response, such as the frequency of heat extremes over land and oceans (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fischer--2015">Fischer and Knutti, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fr%C3%B6licher--2018">Frölicher et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kharin--2018">Kharin et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Perkins-Kirkpatrick--2017">Perkins-Kirkpatrick and Gibson, 2017</a>) if the relationship of the variable of interest to the GWL is scenario independent. The latter means that the response is independent of the pathway and relative contribution of various radiative forcings. For some more complex indices like warm-spell duration, or for regions with strong aerosol changes, discrepancies can be larger (Z. <a class="reference-link" href="#Wang--2017"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Wang--2017">Wang et al., 2017</a>b; <a class="reference-link" href="#King--2018">King et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tebaldi--2020">Tebaldi et al., 2020</a>).

This property has also been used to develop regionally resolved emulators for global climate models, using global surface temperature as input (<a class="reference-link" href="#Beusch--2020">Beusch et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tebaldi--2020">Tebaldi et al., 2020</a>).

This is despite their difference in global warming response (Chapter 4), confirming a substantial decoupling between the two responses (global warming vs GWL-based regional response) for these variables. Thus, the GWL approach isolates the uncertainty in the regional climate response from the global warming uncertainty induced by scenario, global mean model response and internal variability (Cross-Chapter Box, Figure 1).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-subhead-H1---no-space-below" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed">Mapping between GWL- and scenario-based responses in</span> <span class="•-Bold-condensed">model analyses</span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">To map scenario-based climate projections into changes at specific GWLs, first, all individual Earth system model (ESM) simulations that reach a certain GWL are identified. Second, the climate response patterns at the respective GWL are calculated using an approach termed here ‘GWL-sampling’ – sometimes also referred to as epoch analysis, time shift, or time sampling approach – taking into account all models and scenarios (Cross-Chapter Box, Figure 3). Note that the range of years when a given GWL is reached in the CMIP6 ensemble is different from the AR6 assessed range of projected global surface temperature (<a class="section-link" data-title="Synthesis Assessment of Projected Change in Global Surface Air Temperature" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4#4.3.4">Section 4.3.4</a>; Table 4.5). The latter further takes into account different lines of evidence, including the assessed observed warming between pre-industrial and present day, information from observational constraints on CMIP6, and emulators using the assessed transient climate response (TCR) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) ranges (<a class="section-link" data-title="Synthesis Assessment of Projected Change in Global Surface Air Temperature" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4#4.3.4">Section 4.3.4</a>). Hence the <a class="section-link" data-title="Future Global Climate: Scenario-based Projections and Near-term Information" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4">Chapter 4</a> assessed range (Table 4.5) is the reference to determine when a given GWL is <i class="•-Condensed-italic">likely </i>reached under given scenarios, while the mapping between scenarios/time frames and GWLs is used to assess the respective regional responses happening at these time frames (which also allows accounting for the global surface temperature assessment, rather than using scenarios analyses directly from CMIP6 output).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">In the model-based asssessment of Chapters 4, 8, 10, 11, 12 and the Atlas, the estimation of changes at GWLs are generally defined as the 20-year time period in which the mean global surface air temperature (GSAT; Cross-Chapter Box 2.3) first exceeds a certain anomaly relative to 1850–1900 – for simulations that start after 1850, relative to all years up to 1900 (Cross-Chapter Box Figure 3).

The use of scenarios is also essential for variables whose climate response strongly depends on the contribution of radiative forcing (e.g., aerosols) or land-use and land management changes, are time and warming rate dependent (e.g., sea level rise), or differ between transient and quasi-equilibrium states.

In the cryosphere, elements that are quick to respond to warming like sea ice area, permafrost and snow, show little scenario dependence (Sections 9.3.1.1, 9.5.2.3 and 9.5.3.3), whereas slow-responding variables such as ice volumes of glaciers and ice sheets respond with a substantial delay and, due to their inertia, the response depends on when a certain GWL is reached. This also applies to some extent for sea level rise where, for example, the contributions of melting glaciers and ice sheets depend on the pathway followed to reach a given GWL (<a class="section-link" data-title="Sea Level Projections up to 2100 Based on Global Warming Levels" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-9#9.6.3.4">Section 9.6.3.4</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">In addition to the lagged effect, the climate response at a given GWL may differ before and after a period of overshoot, for example in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (e.g., Palter et al. 2018).

This general global-scale warming is modulated by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, as well as by feedbacks such as soil moisture-evapotranspiration–temperature and snow/ice-albedo–temperature feedbacks, and local forcings such as land-use change or changes in aerosol concentrations at the regional and local scales (Sections 11.1.5 and 11.1.6, and Box 11.1). Therefore, changes in temperature extremes at regional and local scales can have heterogeneous spatial distributions. Changes in the magnitudes (or intensities) of extreme temperatures are often larger than changes in global surface temperature, because of larger warming on land than on the ocean surface (<a class="section-link" data-title="Surface Temperatures" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.1.1">Section 2.3.1.1</a>), and because of feedbacks, though they are of similar magnitude to changes in the local mean temperature (Figure 11.2).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Extreme temperature events are associated with large-scale meteorological patterns (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grotjahn--2016">Grotjahn et al., 2016</a>).

The large-scale modes of variability (Annex IV) affect the strength, frequency and persistence of these meteorological patterns and, hence, temperature extremes. For example, cold and warm extremes in the mid-latitudes are associated with atmospheric circulation patterns such as the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern, as well as atmosphere–ocean coupled modes such as Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Effects of Large-scale Circulation on Changes in Extremes" href="#11.1.5">Section 11.1.5</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kamae--2014">Kamae et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Johnson--2018">Johnson et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ruprich-Robert--2018">Ruprich-Robert et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yu--2018">Yu et al., 2018</a>, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#M%C3%BCller--2020">Müller et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Qasmi--2021">Qasmi et al., 2021</a>).

Deforestation may have contributed to about one third of the warming of hot extremes in some mid-latitude regions since the pre-industrial time (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lejeune--2018">Lejeune et al., 2018</a>). Aspects of agricultural practice, including no-till farming, irrigation, and overall cropland intensification, may cool hot temperature extremes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Davin--2014">Davin et al., 2014</a>; N.D. <a class="reference-link" href="#Mueller--2016"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Mueller--2016">Mueller et al., 2016</a>). For instance, cropland intensification has been suggested to be responsible for a cooling of the highest temperature percentiles in Midwest USA (N.D. <a class="reference-link" href="#Mueller--2016"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Mueller--2016">Mueller et al., 2016</a>). Irrigation has been shown to be responsible for a cooling of hot temperature extremes of up to 1°C–2°C in many mid-latitude regions in the present climate (Thieryet al., 2017, 2020), a process not represented in most of state-of-the-art ESMs (CMIP5, CMIP6). Double cropping may have led to increased hot extremes in the inter-cropping season in part of China (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jeong--2014">Jeong et al., 2014</a>). Rapid increases in summer warming in western Europe and north-east Asia since the 1980s are linked to a reduction in anthropogenic aerosol precursor emissions over Europe (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nabat--2014">Nabat et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dong--2016b">Dong et al., 2016b</a>, 2017), in addition to the effect of increased greenhouse gas forcing (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Forcings Controlling Regional Climate" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-10#10.1.3.1">Section 10.1.3.1</a>). This effect of aerosols on temperature-related extremes is also noted for declines in short-lived anthropogenic aerosol emissions over North America (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mascioli--2016">Mascioli et al., 2016</a>). On the local scale, the urban heat island (UHI) effect results in higher temperatures in urban areas than in their surrounding regions, and contributes to warming in regions of rapid urbanization, in particular for nighttime temperature extremes (Box 10.3; <a class="reference-link" href="#Phelan--2015">Phelan et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chapman--2017">Chapman et al., 2017</a>; Y. <a class="reference-link" href="#Sun--2019"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Sun--2019"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Sun--2019"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Sun--2019">Sun et al., 2019</a>). But these local and regional forcings are generally not or not well represented in the CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Model Evaluation " href="#11.3.3">Section 11.3.3</a>), contributing to uncertainty in model simulated changes.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In summary, greenhouse gas forcing is the dominant driver leading to the warming of temperature extremes. At regional scales, changes in temperature extremes are modulated by changes in large-scale patterns and modes of variability, feedbacks including soil-moisture–evapotranspiration–temperature or snow/ice–albedo–temperature feedbacks, and local and regional forcings such as land-use and land-cover changes, or aerosol concentrations, and decadal and multi-decadal natural variability. This leads to heterogeneity in regional changes and their associated uncertainties (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>).

The additional observational records, along with a stronger warming signal, show very clearly that changes observed at the time of AR5 (IPCC, 2014) continued, providing strengthened evidence of an increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes. While the magnitude of the observed trends in temperature-related extremes varies depending on the region, spatial and temporal scales, and metric assessed, evidence of a warming effect is overwhelming, robust, and consistent. In particular, an increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes is almost always associated with an increase in the hottest temperatures and in the number of heatwave days. It is also the case for changes (decreases) in cold extremes. For this reason, and to simplify the presentation, the phrase ‘increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes’ is used to represent, collectively, an increase in the magnitude of extreme day and/or night temperatures, in the number of warm days and/or nights, and in the number of heatwave days. Changes in cold extremes are assessed similarly.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">On the global scale, evidence of an increase in the number of warm days and nights and a decrease in the number of cold days and nights, and an increase in the coldest and hottest extreme temperatures is very robust and consistent among all variables. Figure 11.2 displays time series of globally averaged TXx and TNn on land. Warming of land mean TXx is similar to the mean temperature warming on land, which is about 45% higher than global warming (<a class="section-link" data-title="Atmosphere and Earth’s Surface" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.1">Section 2.3.1</a>). Warming of land mean TNn is even higher, with about 3°C of warming since 1960 (Figure 11.2). Figure 11.9 shows maps of linear trends over 1960–2018 in TXx, TNn, and frequency of warm days (TX90p). The maps for TXx and TNn show trends consistent with overall warming in most regions, with a particularly high warming of TXx in Europe and north-western South America, and a particularly high warming of TNn in the Arctic. Consistent with the observed warming in global surface temperature (<a class="section-link" data-title="Temperatures During the Instrumental Period – Free Atmosphere" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.1.2">Section 2.3.1.2</a>) and the observed trends in TXx and TNn, the frequency of TX90p has increased, while that of cold nights (TN10p) has decreased since the 1950s: Nearly all land regions showed statistically significant decreases in TN10p (<a class="reference-link" href="#Alexander--2016">Alexander, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dunn--2020">Dunn et al., 2020</a>), though trends in TX90p are variable with some decreases in Southern South America, mainly during austral summer (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rusticucci--2017">Rusticucci et al., 2017</a>). A decrease in the number of cold spell days is also observed over nearly all land surface areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Easterling--2016">Easterling et al., 2016</a>) and in the northern mid-latitudes in particular (<a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Oldenborgh--2019">van Oldenborgh et al., 2019</a>).

The observed increases in Rx1day and Rx5day over the Northern Hemisphere land area during 1951–2005 can be attributed to the effect of combined anthropogenic forcing, including greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols, as simulated by CMIP5 models and the rate of intensification with regard to warming is consistent with C-C scaling (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2013">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). This is confirmed to be robust when an additional nine years of observational data and the CMIP6 model simulations were used (Cross-Chapter Box 3.2, Figure 1; <a class="reference-link" href="#Paik--2020">Paik et al., 2020</a>). The influence of greenhouse gases is attributed as the dominant contributor to the observed intensification. The global average of Rx1day in the observations is consistent with simulations by both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models under anthropogenic forcing, but not under natural forcing (Cross-Chapter Box 3.2, Figure 1). The observed increase in the fraction of annual total precipitation falling into the top fifth or top first percentiles of daily precipitation can also be attributed to human influence at the global scale (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dong--2021">Dong et al., 2021</a>).

The reduction in post-volcanic eruption extreme precipitation in the simulations is closely linked to the decrease in mean precipitation, for which both thermodynamic effects (moisture reduction due to surface cooling) and dynamic effects (monsoon circulation weakening) play important roles.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">There has been new evidence of human influence on extreme precipitation at continental scales, including the detection of the combined effect of greenhouse gases and aerosol forcing on Rx1day and Rx5day over North America, Eurasia, and mid-latitude land regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2013">Zhang et al., 2013</a>) and of greenhouse gas forcing in Rx1day and Rx5day in the mid-to-high latitudes, western and eastern Eurasia, and the global dry regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Paik--2020">Paik et al., 2020</a>).

Pan evaporation has increased as a consequence of VPD changes in several AR6 regions, such as East Asia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Li--2013">Li et al., 2013</a>; Z. <a class="reference-link" href="#Sun--2018">Sun et al., 2018</a>; M.-Z. <a class="reference-link" href="#Yang--2018"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Yang--2018"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Yang--2018"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Yang--2018"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Yang--2018">Yang et al., 2018</a>), Western and Central Europe (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mozny--2020">Mozny et al., 2020</a>), the Mediterranean, (<a class="reference-link" href="#Azorin-Molina--2015">Azorin-Molina et al., 2015</a>) and Central and Southern Australia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stephens--2018">Stephens et al., 2018</a>). Nevertheless, there is an important regional variability in observed trends, and in other AR6 regions pan evaporation has decreased – for example, in North Central America (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bre%C3%B1a-Naranjo--2017">Breña-Naranjo et al., 2017</a>) and in the Tibetan Plateau (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2018"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2018"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2018">C.

Physical models also show an important regional diversity, with an increase in New Zealand (<a class="reference-link" href="#Salinger--2014">Salinger and Porteous, 2014</a>) and the Mediterranean (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gocic--2014">Gocic and Trajkovic, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Azorin-Molina--2015">Azorin-Molina et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Piticar--2016">Piticar et al., 2016</a>), a decrease in South Asia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jhajharia--2015">Jhajharia et al., 2015</a>), and strong spatial variability in North America (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seager--2015b">Seager et al., 2015b</a>). This variability is driven by the role of other meteorological variables affecting AED. Changes in solar radiation as a consequence of solar dimming and brightening may affect trends (<a class="section-link" data-title="Changes in the Global Energy Inventory" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-7#7.2.2.2">Section 7.2.2.2</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kambezidis--2012">Kambezidis et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wang--2014">Wang and Yang, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sanchez-Lorenzo--2015">Sanchez-Lorenzo et al., 2015</a>). Wind speed is also relevant (<a class="reference-link" href="#McVicar--2012b">McVicar et al., 2012b</a>), and studies suggest a reduction of the wind speed in some regions (Z. <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2019"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2019"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2019"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#Zhang--2019">Zhang et al., 2019</a>b) that could compensate the role of the VPD increase. Nevertheless, the VPD trend seems to dominate the overall AED trends, compared to the effects of trends in wind speed and solar radiation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wang--2012">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Park%20Williams--2017">Park Williams et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Vicente-Serrano--2020a">Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020a</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="11.6.2.3"><h3 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">11.6.2.3 Soil Moisture Deficits<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-9-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">There are limited long-term measurements of soil moisture from ground observations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dorigo--2011">Dorigo et al., 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Qiu--2016">Qiu et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Quiring--2016">Quiring et al., 2016</a>), which impedes their use in the analysis of trends.

TC translation speed is a measure of the speed at which TCs move across the Earth’s surface, and is very closely related to local rainfall amounts (i.e., a slower translation speed causes greater local rainfall). TC translation speed also affects structural wind damage and coastal storm surge by changing the hazard event duration. The slowdown is observed in the best-track data from all basins except the Northern Indian Ocean, and is also found in a number of regions where TCs interact directly with land. The slowing trends identified in the best-track data by <a class="reference-link" href="#Kossin--2018">Kossin (2018)</a> have been argued to be largely due to data heterogeneity. <a class="reference-link" href="#Moon--2019">Moon et al.

Kossin (2019) provides evidence that the slowing trend is real by focusing on Atlantic TC track data over the contiguous USA in the 118-year period 1900–2017, which are generally considered reliable. In this period, mean TC translation speed has decreased by 17%. The slowing TC translation speed is expected to increase local rainfall amounts, which would increase coastal and inland flooding. In combination with slowing translation speed, abrupt TC track direction changes – that can be associated with track ‘meanders’ or ‘stalls’ – have become increasingly common along the North American coast since the mid-20th century, leading to more rainfall in the region (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hall--2019">Hall and Kossin, 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">In summary, there is mounting evidence that a variety of TC characteristics have changed over various time periods.

One test of the models is to evaluate their ability to reproduce the dependency of the TC statistics in the different basins in the real world, in addition to their capability of reproducing atmospheric and ocean environmental conditions.

In addition to the general vigorousness of precipitation, hail, and winds associated with MCSs, characteristics of MCSs are viewed in new perspectives in recent years, probably because of both the development of dense mesoscale observing networks and advances in high-resolution mesoscale modelling (Sections 11.7.3.2 and 11.7.3.3). The horizontal scale of MCSs is discussed with their organization of the convective structure, and it is examined with a concept of ‘convective aggregation’ in recent years (<a class="reference-link" href="#Holloway--2017">Holloway et al., 2017</a>). MCSs sometimes take a linear shape and stay almost stationary with successive production of cumulonimbus on the upstream side (back-building type convection), and cause heavy rainfall (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schumacher--2005">Schumacher and Johnson, 2005</a>).

The convective modes of severe storms in the USA can be classified into rotating or linear modes and preferable environmental conditions for these modes, such as vertical shear, have been identified (<a class="reference-link" href="#Trapp--2005">Trapp et al., 2005</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Smith--2013">Smith et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Allen--2018">Allen, 2018</a>).

Drought events characterized by low precipitation and extreme high temperatures have occurred, for example, in California (<a class="reference-link" href="#AghaKouchak--2014">AghaKouchak et al., 2014</a>), inland Eastern Australia (<a class="reference-link" href="#King--2014">King et al., 2014</a>), and large parts of Europe (<a class="reference-link" href="#Orth--2016a">Orth et al., 2016a</a>).

The dominant signal is related to the increase in heatwave occurrence, which has been attributed to anthropogenic forcing (<a class="section-link" data-title="Detection and Attribution, Event Attribution" href="#11.3.4">Section 11.3.4</a>). This means that, even if drought occurrence is unaffected, compound hot and dry events will be more frequent (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sarhadi--2018">Sarhadi et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yu--2020">Yu and Zhai, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Drought and heatwaves are also associated with fire weather, related through high temperatures, low soil moisture, and low humidity. Fire weather refers to weather conditions conducive to triggering and sustaining wildfires, which generally include temperature, soil moisture, humidity, and wind (Chapter 12). Concurrent hot and dry conditions amplify conditions that promote wildfires (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schubert--2014">Schubert et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Littell--2016">Littell et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dowdy--2018">Dowdy, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hope--2019">Hope et al., 2019</a>). Burnt area extent in western USA forests (<a class="reference-link" href="#Abatzoglou--2016">Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016</a>) and particularly in California (<a class="reference-link" href="#Williams--2019">Williams et al., 2019</a>) has been linked to anthropogenic climate change via a significant increase in vapour pressure deficit, a primary driver of wildfires. A study of the western USA examined the correlation between historical water-balance deficits and annual area burned, across a range of vegetation types, from temperate rainforest to desert (<a class="reference-link" href="#McKenzie--2017">McKenzie and Littell, 2017</a>). The relationship between temperature and dryness, and wildfire, varied with ecosystem type, and the fire–climate relationship was nonstationary and vegetation-dependent. In many fire-prone regions, such as the Mediterranean and China’s Daxing’anling region, projections for increased severity of future drought and heatwaves may lead to an increased frequency of wildfires relative to observed climatology (Tian et al., 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ruffault--2018">Ruffault et al., 2018</a>). Observations show a long-term trend towards more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires in many regions of Australia, which is attributable (at least in part) to anthropogenic climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dowdy--2018">Dowdy, 2018</a>). There is emerging evidence that recent regional surges in wildland fires are being driven by changing weather extremes (Cross-Chapter Box 3; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jia--2019">Jia et al., 2019</a>; SRCCL Chapter 2). Between 1979 and 2013, the global burnable area affected by long fire weather seasons doubled, and the mean length of the fire weather season increased by 19% (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jolly--2015">Jolly et al., 2015</a>). However, at the global scale, the total burned area has been decreasing between 1998 and 2015 due to human activities mostly related to changes in land use (<a class="reference-link" href="#Andela--2017">Andela et al., 2017</a>). Given the projected <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> increase in compound hot and dry conditions, there is <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> that fire weather conditions will become more frequent at higher levels of global warming in some regions. This assessment is also consistent with Chapter 12’s examination of regional projected changes in fire weather. The SRCCL (Chapter 2) assessed with <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> that future climate variability is expected to enhance the risk and severity of wildfires in many biomes such as tropical rainforests.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify- _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">In summary, there is <i class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</i> that concurrent heatwaves and droughts have increased in frequency over the last century at the global scale due to human influence.

This can occur as a result of natural climate variability, as climates in different parts of the world are interconnected through large-scale atmospheric–oceanic teleconnections. In addition, in a warming climate, the probability of having several locations being affected simultaneously by, for example, hot extremes and heatwaves increases strongly as a function of global warming, with detectable changes even for changes as small as +0.5°C of additional global warming (Sections 11.2.4 and 11.3, Cross-chapter Box 11.1). Recent articles have highlighted the risks associated with concurrent extremes over large spatial scales (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Lehner--2015">Lehner and Stocker, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Boers--2019">Boers et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gaupp--2019">Gaupp et al., 2019</a>).

Hereafter, the focus is on two case studies of recent global-scale events that featured concurrent extremes in several regions across the world. The first focuses on concurrent extremes driven by variability in tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) associated with the 2015–2016 extreme El Niño, while the second addresses the impacts of global warming combined with abnormal atmospheric circulation patterns in the 2018 boreal spring/summer.</p><div class="_idGenObjectStyleOverride-1" id="_idContainer0751"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-Figure-title" lang="en-GB"><strong class="IPCC_•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-30" id="box-11-4-figure-2" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Box_11_4_Figure_1.png"></span></strong></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-Figure-title" lang="en-GB"><strong class="IPCC_•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Box 11.4, Figure 1 | </span></strong><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> | Analysis of the percentage of land area affected by temperature extremes larger than two (blue) or three (orange) standard deviations in June–July–August (JJA) between 30°N and 80°N using a normalization. </span>This figure shows a substantial increase in the overall land area affected by very strong hot extremes since 1990.

Additionally, the background climate warming associated with greenhouse gas forcing can significantly exacerbate extremes in parts of the world, even under normal El Niño conditions. The 2015–2016 extreme El Niño event was one of the three extreme El Niño events since the 1980s and the availability of satellite rainfall observations. According to some measures, it was the strongest El Niño in the past 145 years (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barnard--2017">Barnard et al., 2017</a>). The 2015–2016 warmth was unprecedented at the central equatorial Pacific (Niño4: 5°N–5°S, 150°E–150°W), and this exceptional warmth was <i class="•-Condensed-italic">unlikely </i> to have occurred entirely naturally, appearing to reflect an anthropogenically forced trend (<a class="reference-link" href="#Newman--2018">Newman et al., 2018</a>). In particular, its signal was seen in very high monthly global mean surface temperature (GMST) values in late 2015 and early 2016, contributing to the highest record of GMST in 2016 (<a class="section-link" data-title="Surface Temperatures" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-2#2.3.1.1">Section 2.3.1.1</a>).

We now know that the ways in which average and extreme conditions have changed (and will continue to change) depend on the variable and the phenomenon being considered. Changes in local surface temperature extremes closely follow the corresponding changes in local average surface temperatures. On the contrary, changes in precipitation extremes (heavy precipitation) generally do not follow those in average precipitation, and can even move in the opposite direction (e.g., with average precipitation decreasing but extreme precipitati</i><i class="•-Regular-Italic">on increasing). </i></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body">Climate change will manifest very differently depending on which region, season and variable we are interested in. For example, over some parts of the Arctic, temperatures will warm at rates about three to four times higher during winter compared to summer months. And in summer, most of northern Europe will experience larger temperatures increases than most places in south-east South America and Australasia, with differences that can be larger than 1°C, depending on the level of global warming. In general, differences across regions and seasons arise because the underlying physical processes differ drastically across regions and seasons.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body">Climate change will also manifest differently for different weather regimes and can lead to contrasting changes in average and extreme conditions. Observations of the recent past and climate model projections show that, in most places, changes in daily temperatures are dominated by a general warming where the climatological average and extreme values are shifted towards higher temperatures, making warm extremes more frequent and cold extremes less frequent. The top panels in FAQ 11.1, Figure 1 show projected changes in surface temperature for long-term average conditions (left) and for extreme hot days (right) during the warm season (summer in mid- to high latitudes). Projected increases in long-term average temperature differ substantially between different places, varying from less than 3°C in some places in central South Asia and southern South America to over 7°C in some places in North America, North Africa and the Middle East. Changes in extreme hot days follow changes in average conditions quite closely, although, in some places, the warming rates for extremes can be intensified (e.g., southern Europe and the Amazon basin) or weakened (e.g., northern Asia and Greenland) compared to average values.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body">Recent observations and global and regional climate model projections point to changes in precipitation extremes (including both rainfall and snowfall extremes) differing drastically from those in average precipitation. The bottom panels in FAQ 11.1, Figure 1 show projected changes in the long-term average precipitation (left) and in heavy precipitation (right). Averaged precipitation changes show striking regional differences, with substantial drying in places such as southern Europe and northern South America and wetting in places such as the Middle East and southern South America. Changes in extreme precipitation are much more uniform, with systematic increases over nearly all land regions. The physical reasons behind the different responses of averaged and extreme precipitation are now well understood. The intensification of extreme precipitation is driven by the increase in atmospheric water vapour (about 7% per 1°C of warming near the surface), although this is modulated by various dynamical changes. In contrast, changes in average precipitation are driven not only by moisture increases but also by slower processes that constrain future changes over the globe to only 2–3% per 1°C of warming near the surface.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body _idGenParaOverride-1">In summary, the specific relationship between changes in average and extreme conditions strongly depends on the variable or phenomenon being considered. At the local scale, average and extreme surface temperature changes are strongly related, while average and extreme precipitation changes are often weakly related. For both variables, the changes in average and extreme conditions vary strongly across different places due to the effect of local and regional processes.</p><p class="•-Graphic-insert"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" id="faq-11-1-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_11_1_Figure_1.png"></span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 11.1, Figure 1 | </span></span><i class="•-Condensed-italic"></i><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Global maps of future changes in surface temperature (top panels) and precipitation (bottom panels) for long-term average (left) and extreme conditions (right). </span>All changes were estimated using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) ensemble median for a scenario with a global warming of 4°C relative to 1850–1900 temperatures.

As the climate moves away from its past and current states, we will experience extreme events that are unprecedented, either in magnitude, frequency, timing or location. The frequency of these unprecedented extreme events will rise with increasing global warming. Additionally, the combined occurrence of multiple unprecedented extremes may result in large and unprece</i><i class="•-Regular-Italic">dented impacts. </i></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body">Human-induced climate change has already affected many aspects of the climate system. In addition to the increase in global surface temperature, many types of weather and climate extremes have changed. In most regions, the frequency and intensity of hot extremes have increased and those of cold extremes have decreased. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased at the global scale and over a majority of land regions. Although extreme events such as land and marine heatwaves, heavy precipitation, drought, tropical cyclones, and associated wildfires and coastal flooding have occurred in the past and will continue to occur in the future, they often come with different magnitudes or frequencies in a warmer world. For example, future heatwaves will last longer and have higher temperatures, and future extreme precipitation events will be more intense in several regions. Certain extremes, such as extreme cold, will be less intense and less frequent with increasing warming.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body">Unprecedented extremes – that is, events not experienced in the past – will occur in the future in five different ways (FAQ 11.2, Figure 1). First, events that are considered to be extreme in the current climate will occur in the future with unprecedented magnitudes. Second, future extreme events will also occur with unprecedented frequency. Third, certain types of extremes may occur in regions that have not previously encountered those types of events. For example, as the sea level rises, coastal flooding may occur in new locations, and wildfires are already occurring in areas, such as parts of the Arctic, where the probability of such events was previously low. Fourth, extreme events may also be unprecedented in their timing. For example, extremely hot temperatures may occur either earlier or later in the year than they have in the past.</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1" id="_idContainer080"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-31" id="faq-11-2-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_11_2_Figure_1.png"></span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 11.2, Figure 1 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">New types of unprecedented extremes that will occur as a result of </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">climate change. </span></p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body">Finally, compound events – where multiple extreme events of either different or similar types occur simultaneously and/or in succession – may be more probable or severe in the future. These compound events can often impact ecosystems and societies more strongly than when such events occur in isolation. For example, a drought along with extreme heat will increase the risk of wildfires and agriculture damages or losses. As individual extreme events become more severe as a result of climate change, the combined occurrence of these events will create unprecedented compound events. This could exacerbate the intensity and associated impacts of these extreme events.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body">Unprecedented extremes have already occurred in recent years, relative to the 20th century climate. Some recent extreme hot events would have had very little chance of occurring without human influence on the climate (see FAQ 11.3). In the future, unprecedented extremes will occur as the climate continues to warm. Those extremes will happen with larger magnitudes and at higher frequencies than previously experienced. Extreme events may also appear in new locations, at new times of the year, or as unprecedented compound events. Moreover, unprecedented events will become more frequent with higher levels of warming, for example at 3°C of global warming compared to 2°C of global warming.</p></div><h2 class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-Box-main-heading">FAQ 11.3 | <span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Did Climate Change Cause That Recent Extreme Event </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">In My Country?</span><span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-58-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body" id="faq-11-3"><i class="•-Regular-Italic">While it is difficult to identify the exact causes of a particular extreme event, the relatively new science of event attribution is able to quantify the role of climate change in altering the probability and magnitude of some types of weather and climate extremes. There is strong evidence that characteristics of many individual extreme events have already changed because of human-driven changes to the climate system. Some types of highly impactful extreme weather events have occurred more often and have become more severe due to these human influences. As the climate continues to warm, the observed changes in the probability and/or magnitude of some extreme weather events will continue as the human influences on these eve</i><i class="•-Regular-Italic">nts increase. </i></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body">It is common to question whether human-caused climate change caused a major weather- and climate-related disaster. When extreme weather and climate events do occur, both exposure and vulnerability play an important role in determining the magnitude and impacts of the resulting disaster. As such, it is difficult to attribute a specific disaster directly to climate change. However, the relatively new science of event attribution enables scientists to attribute aspects of specific extreme weather and climate events to certain causes. Scientists cannot answer directly whether a particular event was caused by climate change, as extremes do occur naturally, and any specific weather and climate event is the result of a complex mix of human and natural factors. Instead, scientists quantify the relative importance of human and natural influences on the magnitude and/or probability of specific extreme weather events. Such information is important for disaster risk reduction planning, because improved knowledge about changes in the probability and magnitude of relevant extreme events enables better quantification of disaster risks.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body">On a case-by-case basis, scientists can now quantify the contribution of human influences to the magnitude and probability of many extreme events. This is done by estimating and comparing the probability or magnitude of the same type of event between the current climate – including the increases in greenhouse gas concentrations and other human influences – and an alternate world where the atmospheric greenhouse gases remained at pre-industrial levels. FAQ 11.3 Figure 1 illustrates this approach using differences in temperature and probability between the two scenarios as an example. Both the pre-industrial (blue) and current (red) climates experience hot extremes, but with different probabilities and magnitudes. Hot extremes of a given temperature have a higher probability of occurrence in the warmer current climate than in the cooler pre-industrial climate. Additionally, an extreme hot event of a particular probability will be warmer in the current climate than in the pre-industrial climate. Climate model simulations are often used to estimate the occurrence of a specific event in both climates. The change in the magnitude and/or probability of the extreme event in the current climate compared to the pre-industrial climate is attributed to the difference between the two scenarios, which is the human influence.</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1" id="_idContainer082"><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><img loading="lazy" alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-32" id="faq-11-3-figure-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_FAQ_11_3_Figure_1.png"></span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box---Figure-title ParaOverride-7"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">FAQ 11.3, Figure 1 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Changes in climate result in changes in the magnitude and probability of extremes. </span>Example of how temperature extremes differ between a climate with pre-industrial greenhouse gases (shown in blue) and the current climate (shown in orange) for a representative region. The horizontal axis shows the range of extreme temperatures, while the vertical axis shows the annual chance of each temperature event’s occurrence. Moving towards the right indicates increasingly hotter extremes that are more rare (less probable). For hot extremes, an extreme event of a particular temperature in the pre-industrial climate would be more probable (vertical arrow) in the current climate. An event of a certain probability in the pre-industrial climate would be warmer (horizontal arrow) in the current climate. While the climate under greenhouse gases at the pre-industrial level experiences a range of hot extremes, such events are hotter and more frequent in the current climate.</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body">Attributable increases in probability and magnitude have been identified consistently for many hot extremes. Attributable increases have also been found for some extreme precipitation events, including hurricane rainfall events, but these results can vary among events. In some cases, large natural variations in the climate system prevent attributing changes in the probability or magnitude of a specific extreme to human influence. Additionally, attribution of certain classes of extreme weather (e.g., tornadoes) is beyond current modelling and theoretical capabilities. As the climate continues to warm, larger changes in probability and magnitude are expected and, as a result, it will be possible to attribute future temperature and precipitation extremes in many locations to human influences. Attributable changes may emerge for other types of extremes as the warming signal increases.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Yellow--FAQ--boxes_•-FAQ-box-body">In conclusion, human-caused global warming has resulted in changes in a wide variety of recent extreme weather events. Strong increases in probability and magnitude, attributable to human influence, have been found for many heatwaves and hot extremes around the world.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="Large"><h1 class="unnumbered" lang="en-GB">Large Tables</h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-13-siblings"><strong class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Table 11.4 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Observed trends, human contribution to observed trends, and projected chang</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">es at 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C of global warming for temperature extremes in Africa, subdivided by AR6 regions. </span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"></span> See Sections 11.9.1 and 11.9.2 for details.
