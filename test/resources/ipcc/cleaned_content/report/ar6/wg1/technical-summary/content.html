As part of that contribution, this Technical Summary (TS) is designed to bridge between the comprehensive assessment of the WGI Chapters and its Summary for Policymakers (SPM). It is primarily built from the Executive Summaries of the individual chapters and <a class="section-link" data-title="Atlas" href="/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/atlas">Atlas</a> and provides a synthesis of key findings based on multiple lines of evidence (e.g., analyses of observations, models, paleoclimate information and understanding of physical, chemical and biological processes and components of the climate system). All the findings and figures here are supported by and traceable to the underlying chapters, with relevant chapter sections indicated in curly brackets.</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Throughout this Technical Summary, key assessment findings are reported using the IPCC calibrated uncertainty language (Chapter 1, Box 1.1).

The five IPCC assessment cycles since 1990 have comprehensively and consistently laid out the rapidly accumulating evidence of a changing climate system, with the Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 being the first to conclude that warming of the climate system is unequivocal. Sustained changes have been documented in all major elements of the climate system: the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, biosphere and ocean (Section TS.2). Multiple lines of evidence indicate the recent large-scale climatic changes are unprecedented in a multi-millennial context and that they represent a millennial-scale commitment for the slow-responding elements of the climate system, resulting in continued worldwide loss of ice, increase in ocean heat content, sea level rise and deep ocean acidification (Box TS.2; Section TS.2). <span><span class="ch-link">Links to chapters</span><span class="ch-link-popup">1.2.1, 1.3, Box 1.2, 2.2, 2.3, Figure 2.34, 5.1, 5.3, 9.2, 9.4–9.6, Appendix 1.A</span></span></p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Earth’s climate system has evolved over many millions of years, and evidence from natural archives provides a long-term perspective on observed changes and projected changes over the coming centuries.

The principal natural drivers of climate change, including changes in incoming solar radiation, volcanic activity, orbital cycles and changes in global biogeochemical cycles, have been studied systematically since the early 20th century. Other major anthropogenic drivers, such as atmospheric aerosols (fine solid particles or liquid droplets), land-use change and non-CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-5">2</sub> greenhouse gases, were identified by the 1970s. Since systematic scientific assessments began in the 1970s, the influence of human activities on the warming of the climate system has evolved from theory to established fact (see also Section TS.2). The evidence for human influence on recent climate change strengthened from the IPCC First Assessment Report in 1990 to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report in 2013/14, and is now even stronger in this assessment (Sections TS.1.2.4 and TS.2).

Paleo evidence extends instrument-based observations of climate variables and climate drivers back in time, providing the long-term context needed to gauge the extent to which recent and potential future changes are unusual (Section TS.2, Figure TS.1). Pre-industrial climate states complement evidence from climate model projections by providing real-world examples of climate characteristics for past global warming levels, with empirical evidence for how the slow-responding components of the climate system operate over centuries to millennia – the time scale for committed climate change (Core Concepts Box, Box TS.4, Box TS.9).

This paleo context supports the assessment that ongoing increase in ocean heat content (OHC) represents a long-term commitment (see Core Concepts Box), essentially irreversible on human time scales (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>). Estimates of past global OHC variations generally track those of sea surface temperatures around Antarctica, underscoring the importance of Southern Ocean processes in regulating deep-ocean temperatures.

At the same time, the storage of remineralized carbon in the ocean interior increased by as much as 750–950 PgC, sufficient to balance the removal of carbon from the atmosphere (200 PgC) and terrestrial biosphere reservoirs combined (<i class="•-Condensed-italic">high confidence</i>). <span><span class="ch-link">Links to chapters</span><span class="ch-link-popup">5.1.2.2</span></span></p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="TS.1.2"><h2 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">TS.1.2 Progress in Climate Science<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-7-siblings"><div class="h3-container" id="TS.1.2.1"><h3 class="numbered" lang="de-DE">TS.1.2.1 Observation-based Products and their Assessments<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-1-siblings"><p class="TS-Technical-Summary-styles_•-TS-Standfirst-with-blue-sidebar" lang="en-GB">Observational capabilities have continued to improve and expand overall since AR5, enabling improved consistency between independent estimates of climate drivers, the combined climate feedbacks, and the observed energy and sea level increase.

Human influence in the IPCC context refers to the human activities that lead to or contribute to a climate response, such as the human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases that subsequently alter the atmosphere’s radiative properties, resulting in warming of the atmosphere, ocean and land components of the climate system. Other human activities influencing climate include the emission of aerosols and other short-lived climate forcers, and land-use change such as urbanization. Progress in our understanding of human influence is gained from longer observational datasets, improved paleoclimate information, a stronger warming signal since AR5, and improvements in climate models, physical understanding and attribution techniques (see Core Concepts Box).

Emissions from natural sources, such as the ocean and the land biosphere, are usually assumed to be constant, or to evolve in response to changes in anthropogenic forcings or to projected climate change.

These SSP scenarios offer unprecedented detail of input data for ESM simulations and allow for a more comprehensive assessment of climate drivers and responses, in particular because some aspects, such as the temporal evolution of pollutants, emissions or changes in land use and land cover, span a broader range in the SSP scenarios than in the RCPs used in AR5. Modelling studies utilizing the RCPs complement the assessment based on SSP scenarios, for example, at the regional scale (Section TS.4). Scenario extensions are based on assumptions about the post-2100 evolution of emissions or of radiative forcing that are independent from the modelling of socio-economic dynamics, which does not extend beyond 2100. To explore specific dimensions, such as air pollution or temporary overshoot of a given warming level, scenario variants are used in addition to the core set. <span><span class="ch-link">Links to chapters</span><span class="ch-link-popup">1.6.1, Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, 4.2.2, 4.2.6, 4.7.1, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1</span></span></p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">SSP1-1.9 represents the low end of future emissions pathways, leading to warming below 1.5°C in 2100 and limited temperature overshoot of 1.5°C over the course of the 21st century (see Figure TS.6).

SSP3-7.0 has overall lower GHG emissions than SSP5-8.5 but, for example, CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> emissions still almost double by 2100 compared to today’s levels. SSP2-4.5 and SSP1-2.6 represent scenarios with stronger climate change mitigation and thus lower GHG emissions. SSP1-2.6 was designed to limit warming to below 2°C. Infographic TS.1 presents a narrative depiction of SSP-related climate futures. No likelihood is attached to the scenarios assessed in this Report, and the feasibility of specific scenarios in relation to current trends is best informed by the WGIII contribution to AR6. In the scenario literature, the plausibility of some scenarios with high CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> emissions, such as RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5, has been debated in light of recent developments in the energy sector. However, climate projections from these scenarios can still be valuable because the concentration levels reached in RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5 and corresponding simulated climate futures cannot be ruled out. That is because of uncertainty in carbon-cycle feedbacks which, in nominally lower emissions trajectories, can result in projected concentrations that are higher than the central concentration levels typically used to drive model projections. <span><span class="ch-link">Links to chapters</span><span class="ch-link-popup">1.6.1; Cross-Chapter Box 1.4; 4.2.2, 5.4; SROCC; Chapter 3 in WGIII</span></span></p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The socio-economic narratives underlying SSP-based scenarios differ in their assumed level of air pollution control. Together with variations in climate change mitigation stringency, this difference strongly affects anthropogenic emissions trajectories of SLCFs, some of which are also air pollutants. SSP1 and SSP5 assume strong pollution control, projecting a decline of global emissions of ozone precursors (except methane; CH<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">4</sub>) and of aerosols and most of their precursors in the mid- to long term. The reductions due to air pollution controls are further strengthened in scenarios that assume a marked decarbonization, such as SSP1-1.9 or SSP1-2.6. SSP2-4.5 is a medium pollution-control scenario with air pollutant emissions following current trends, and SSP3-7.0 is a weak pollution-control scenario with strong increases in emissions of air pollutants over the 21st century. Methane emissions in SSP-based scenarios vary with the overall climate change mitigation stringency, declining rapidly in SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 but declining only after 2070 in SSP5-8.5. SSP trajectories span a wider range of air pollutant emissions than considered in the RCP scenarios (see Figure TS.4), reflecting the potential for large regional differences in their assumed pollution policies. Their effects on climate and air pollution are assessed in Box TS.7. <span><span class="ch-link">Links to chapters</span><span class="ch-link-popup">4.4.4, 6.6.1, Figure 6.4, 6.7.1, Figure 6.19</span></span></p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Since the RCPs are also labelled by the level of radiative forcing they reach in 2100, they can in principle be related to the core set of AR6 scenarios (Figure TS.4). However, the RCPs and SSP-based scenarios are not directly comparable. First, the gas-to-gas compositions differ; for example, the SSP5-8.5 scenario has higher CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> but lower CH<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">4</sub> concentrations compared to RCP8.5. Second, the projected 21st-century trajectories may differ, even if they result in the same radiative forcing by 2100. Third, the overall effective radiative forcing (see Core Concepts Box) may differ, and tends to be higher for the SSPs compared to RCPs that share the same nominal stratospheric-temperature-adjusted radiative forcing label. Comparing the differences between CMIP5 and CMIP6 projections (Cross-Section Box TS.1) that were driven by RCPs and SSP-based scenarios, respectively, indicates that about half of the difference in simulated warming arises because of higher climate sensitivity being more prevalent in CMIP6 model versions; the remainder arises from higher ERF in nominally corresponding scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5; <i class="•-Condensed-italic">medium confidence</i>)<i class="•-Condensed-italic"></i> (see Section TS.1.2.2).

Concentration-driven simulations are based on a central estimate of carbon cycle feedbacks, while emissions-driven simulations help quantify the role of feedback uncertainty.

Global warming levels are used in this Report as a dimension of integration independent of the timing when the warming level is reached and of the emissions scenario that led to the warming. For many climate variables the response pattern for a given GWL is consistent across different scenarios. However, this is not the case for slowly responding processes, such as ice-sheet and glacier mass loss, deep ocean warming, and the related sea level rise. The response of these variables depends on the time it takes to reach the GWL, differs if the warming is reached in a transient warming state or after a temporary overshoot of the warming level, and will continue to evolve, over centuries to millennia, even after global warming has stabilized. Different GWLs correspond closely to specific cumulative CO<sub class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</sub> emissions due to their near-linear relationship with global surface temperature.

The requirement is that the relationship to the GWL is broadly independent of the scenario and relative contribution of radiative forcing agents. <span><span class="ch-link">Links to chapters</span><span class="ch-link-popup">1.6, 11.2.4, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1</span></span></p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">The GWL approach to integration of climate information also has some limitations. Variables that are quick to respond to warming, like temperature and precipitation, including extremes, sea ice area, permafrost and snow cover, show little scenario dependence for a given GWL, whereas slow-responding variables such as glacier and ice-sheet mass, warming of the deep ocean and their contributions to sea level rise, have substantial dependency on the trajectory of warming taken to reach the GWL. A given GWL can also be reached for different balances between anthropogenic forcing agents, such as long-lived greenhouse gas and SLCF emissions, and the response patterns may depend on this balance. Finally, there is a difference in the response even for temperature-related variables if a GWL is reached in a rapidly warming transient state or in an equilibrium state when the land–sea warming contrast is less pronounced. In this Report, the climate responses at different GWLs are calculated based on climate model projections for the 21st century (see Figure TS.5), which are mostly not in equilibrium.

Historical surface temperature change since 1870 has shown relatively little warming in several key regions of positive feedbacks, including the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean, while showing greater warming in key regions of negative feedbacks, including the western Pacific warm pool.

An important component is the new online interactive tool, the Interactive Atlas, with flexible spatial and temporal analyses of much of the observed, simulated past and projected future climate change data underpinning the WGI assessment. This includes the ability to generate global maps and a number of regionally aggregated products (time series, scatter plots, tables, etc.) for a range of observations and ensemble climate change projections of variables (such as changes in the climatic impact-drivers summarized in Table TS.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phases 5 and 6 (CMIP5, CMIP6) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX).
