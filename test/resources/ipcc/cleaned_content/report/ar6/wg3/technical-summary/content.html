However, climate change mitigation also has synergies and/or trade-offs with many other SDGs. There has been a strong relationship between development and GHG emissions, as historically both per-capita and absolute emissions have risen with industrialisation. However, recent evidence shows countries can grow their economies while reducing emissions. Countries have different priorities in achieving the SDGs and reducing emissions as informed by their respective national conditions and capabilities. Given the differences in GHG emissions contributions, degree of vulnerability and impacts, as well as capacities within and between nations, equity and justice are important considerations for effective climate policy and for securing national and international support for deep decarbonisation. Achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty would involve effective and equitable climate policies at all levels from local to global scale. Failure to address questions of equity and justice over time can undermine social cohesion and stability. International cooperation can enhance efforts to achieve ambitious global climate mitigation in the context of sustainable development. Pathways that illustrate movement towards fulfilling the SDGs are shown in Figure TS.1. <!-- -->{1.4, 1.6, Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 17}</p><div class="Basic-Text-Frame" id="_idContainer011"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" id="figure-ts-1" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Figure_TS_1.png"></span></p><p class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Figure TS.1 | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Sustainable development pathways towards fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals. </span>The graph shows global average per-capita GHG emissions (vertical axis) and relative ‘Historic Index of Human Development’ (HIHD) levels (horizonal) have increased globally since the industrial revolution (grey line).

Likewise, to fulfil SDGs 3, 4 and 8, HIHD levels (see footnote 7 in Chapter 1) need to be at least 0.5 or greater.

In addition to being deeply intertwined, all the factors matter to varying degrees, depending on the prevailing social, economic, cultural and political context. They often both drive and inhibit transitions at the same time, within and across different scales. The development <span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span> and deployment of innovative technologies and systems at scale are important for achieving deep decarbonisation, and in recent years, the cost of several low-carbon technologies has declined sharply as deployment has risen rapidly.

The pace of a transition can be impeded by ‘lock-in’ generated by existing physical capital, institutions, and social norms. The interaction between politics, economics and power relationships is central to explaining why broad commitments do not always translate to urgent action. At the same time, attention to, and support for, climate policies and low-carbon societal transitions has generally increased, as the impacts have become more salient. Both public and private financing and financial structures strongly affect the scale and balance of high- and low-carbon investments. Societal and behavioural norms, regulations and institutions are essential conditions to accelerate low-carbon transitions in multiple sectors, whilst addressing distributional concerns endemic to any major transition. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had far-reaching impacts on the global economic and social system, and recovery will present both challenges and opportunities for climate mitigation.

The effective governance of climate change entails strong action across multiple jurisdictions and decision-making levels, including regular evaluation and learning. Choices that cause climate change as well as the processes for making and implementing relevant decisions involve a range of non-nation state actors such as cities, businesses, and civil society organisations. At global, national and sub-national levels, climate change actions are interwoven with, and embedded in, the context of much broader social, economic and political goals. Therefore, the governance required to address climate change has to navigate power, political, economic, and social dynamics at all levels of decision-making. Effective climate-governing institutions, and openness to experimentation on a variety of institutional arrangements, policies and programmes can play a vital role in engaging stakeholders and building momentum for effective climate action. <!-- -->{1.4, 1.9, Chapters 8, 13, 15, 17}</p><p class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-title--bold-to-------spans-columns ParaOverride-1" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Table TS.1</span></span><span class="•-Figure-table-number---title"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> | </span></span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Signs of progress and continuing challenges. </span></p><table class="IPCC-Table TableOverride-1 noborder tstable" id="table001"><colgroup><col class="_idGenTableRowColumn-1"><col class="_idGenTableRowColumn-2"></colgroup><thead><tr class="IPCC-Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3"><td class="IPCC-Table •-Header-row--blue- •-Header-row--blue-"><p class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-header-row--blue--left-align" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Signs of progress</span></p></td><td class="IPCC-Table •-Header-row--blue- •-Header-row--blue-"><p class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-header-row--blue--left-align" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Continuing challenges</span></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="IPCC-Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4"><td class="IPCC-Table •-Subhead-row--white- •-Body-row CellOverride-1 _idGenCellOverride-1 bluerow" colspan="2"><p class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-header-row--black--left-align-–-7pt" lang="en-US">Emissions trends</p></td></tr><tr class="IPCC-Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5"><td class="IPCC-Table •-Body-row •-Body-row CellOverride-2"><p class="Body-copy_Figures--tables-etc_Table-styles_•-Table-body-row--black--left-align" lang="en-US"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">The rate of global GHG emissions growth has slowed in recent years, </span> from 2.1% yr <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1">–1</span> between 2000 and 2009, to 1.3% yr <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1">–1</span> in between 2010 and 2019.

These metrics use this relationship to calculate the CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions or removals that would result in roughly the same temperature change as a sustained change in the rate of SLCF emissions (CGTP) over a given time period, or as a varying time series of CH<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> emissions (GWP*). IFrom a mitigation perspective, this makes these metrics well-suited in principle to estimate the effect on the remaining carbon budget from more, or less, ambitious SLCF mitigation over multiple decades compared to a given reference scenario (<span class="•-Condensed-italic"> high confidence</span>). However, potential application in wider climate policy (e.g., to inform equitable and ambitious emission targets or to support sector-specific mitigation policies) is contested and relevant literature still limited.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body-last" lang="en-GB">All metrics have limitations and uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions. For this reason, the WGIII contribution to the AR6 reports emissions and mitigation options for individual gases where possible; CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-equivalent emissions are reported in addition to individual gas emissions where this is judged to be policy-relevant. This approach aims to reduce the ambiguity regarding actual climate outcomes over time arising from the use of any specific GHG emission metric. <!-- -->{Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2, SM.2.3, Annex II.II.8; AR6 WGI Chapter 7.6}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Consumption-based CO</span><span class="•-Subscript-bold-condensed-DARK-BLUE _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-"> emissions in Developed Countries and the Asia and Pacific region are higher than in other regions (</span><span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">high confidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">). </span>In Developed Countries, consumption-based CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> emissions peaked at 15 GtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> in 2007, declining to about 13 GtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> in 2018.

Options</span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">In this report, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">development pathways</span> refer to the patterns of development resulting from multiple decisions and choices made by many actors in the national and global contexts. Each society whether in developing or developed regions follows its own pattern of growth (Figure TS.13). Development pathways can also be described at smaller scales (e.g., for regions or cities) and for sectoral systems.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Development pathways are major drivers of GHG emissions <!-- -->{1, 2}<!-- -->. There is compelling evidence to show that continuing along existing development pathways will not achieve rapid and deep emission reductions. In the absence of shifts in development pathways, conventional mitigation policy instruments may not be able to limit global emissions to a degree sufficient to meet ambitious mitigation goals or they may only be able to do so at very high economic and social costs.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Policies to shift development pathways, on the other hand, make mitigation policies more effective. Shifting development pathways broadens the scope for synergies between sustainable development objectives and mitigation. Development pathways also determine the enablers and levers available for adaptation <!-- -->{AR6 WGII TS.E.1.2}<!-- --> and for achieving other SDGs.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">There are many instances in which reducing GHG emissions and moving towards the achievement of other development objectives can go hand in hand <!-- -->{Chapter 3, Figure 3.33, Chapters 6–12, and 17}<!-- -->. Integrated policies can support the creation of synergies between <span class="•-Condensed-italic">action to combat climate change and its impacts</span> (SDG 13 – climate action) and other SDGs. For example, when measures promoting walkable urban areas are combined with electrification and clean renewable energy, there are several co-benefits to be attained. These include reduced pressures on agricultural land from reduced urban growth, health co-benefits from cleaner air, and benefits from enhanced mobility <!-- -->{8.2, 8.4, 4.4.1}<!-- -->. Energy efficiency in buildings and energy poverty alleviation through improved access to clean fuels also deliver significant health benefits. <!-- -->{9.8.1 and 9.8.2}</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">However, decisions about mitigation actions, and their timing and scale, may entail trade-offs with the achievement of other national development objectives in the near, mid- and long term <!-- -->{Chapter 12}<!-- -->. In the near term, for example, regulations may ban vehicles from city centres to reduce congestion and local air pollution but reduce mobility and choice. Increasing green spaces within cities without caps on housing prices may involve trade-offs with affordable housing and push low-income residents outside the city <!-- -->{8.2.2}<!-- -->. In the mid- and long term, large-scale deployment of biomass energy raises concerns about food security and biodiversity conservation <!-- -->{3.7.1, 3.7.5, 7.4.4, 9.8.1, 12.5.2, 12.5.3}<!-- -->. Prioritising is one way to manage these trade-offs, addressing some national development objectives earlier than others. Another way is to adopt policy packages aimed at shifting development pathways towards increased sustainability (SDPS) as they expand the range of tools available to simultaneously achieve multiple development objectives and accelerate mitigation.

Such choices would not be marginal, but include technological, systemic and socio-behavioural changes <!-- -->{4.4}<!-- -->. Decision points also arise with new infrastructure, sustainable supply chains, institutional capacities for evidence-based and integrated decision-making, financial alignment towards low-carbon socially responsible investments, just transitions and shifts in behaviour and norms to support shifts away from fossil fuel consumption. Adopting multi-level governance modes, tackling corruption where it inhibits shifts to sustainability, and improving social and political trust are also key for aligning and supporting long-term environmentally just policies and processes. <!-- -->{4.4, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 4}</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-subhead-H1---no-space-below" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">How can development pathways be ‘shifted’?</span></p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Shifting development paths is complex. Changes that involve ‘dissimilar, unfamiliar and more complex science-based components’ take more time, acceptance and legitimation and involve complex social learning, even when they promise large gains. Despite the complexities of the interactions that result in patterns of development, history also shows that societies can influence the direction of development pathways based on choices made by decision-makers, citizens, the private sector, and social stakeholders. Shifts in development pathways result from both sustained political interventions and bottom-up changes in public opinion. Collective action by individuals as part of social movements or lifestyle changes underpins system change. <!-- -->{5.2.3, 5.4.1, 5.4.5}</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">Sectoral transitions that aim to shift development pathways often have multiple objectives and deploy a diverse mix of policies and institutional measures.

Yet since countries differ in starting points (e.g., social, economic, cultural, political) and historical backgrounds, they have different urgent needs in terms of facilitating the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and, therefore, give different priorities <!-- -->{4.3.2, 17.1}<!-- -->. The appropriate set of policies to shift development pathways thus depends on national circumstances and capacities.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Shifting development pathways towards sustainability needs to be supported by multilateral partnerships to strengthen suitable capacity, technological innovation (TS.6.5), and financial flows (TS.6.4).

It includes respect and dignity for vulnerable groups; creation of decent jobs; social protection; employment rights; fairness in energy access and use and social dialogue and democratic consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">The concept has evolved, becoming prominent in the United States of America in 1980, related to environmental regulations that resulted in job losses from highly polluting industries. Traced from a purely labour movement, trade union space, the Just Transition framework emphasises that decent work and environmental protection are not incompatible. During COP 24, with the Just Transition Silesia Declaration, the concept gained in recognition and was signed by 56 heads of state.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Implicit in a Just Transition is the notion of well-being, equity and justice – the realisation that transitions are inherently disruptive and deliberate effort may be required to ensure communities dependent on fossil-fuel based economies and industries do not suffer disproportionately <!-- -->{Chapter 4}<!-- -->. ‘Just Transitions’ are integral to the European Union as mentioned in the EU Green Deal, the Scottish Government’s development plans and other national low-carbon transition strategies. The US Green New Deal Resolution puts structural inequality, poverty mitigation, and ‘Just Transitions’ at its centre.

Public spending and social safety nets associated with the proceeds from producer economies can be affected as assets become stranded and spending on strategic sustainable development goals such as free education and health-care services are neglected. Fiscal challenges are intricately linked to ‘Just Transitions’ and the management associated with sustainable energy transition. There is no certainty on how energy systems will recover post-COVID-19. However, ‘Just Transitions’ will have equity implications if stimulus packages are implemented without due regard for the differentiated scales and speeds and national and regional contexts, especially in the context of developing countries.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body _idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">A Just Transition entails targeted and proactive measures from governments, agencies, and other non-state authorities to ensure that any negative social, environmental, or economic impacts of economy-wide transitions are minimised, whilst benefits are maximised for those disproportionally affected. These proactive measures include eradication of poverty, regulating prosperity and creating jobs in ‘green’ sectors. In addition, governments, polluting industries, corporations, and those more able to pay higher associated taxes, can pay for transition costs by providing a welfare safety net and adequate compensation to people, communities, and regions that have been impacted by pollution, or are marginalised, or are negatively impacted by a transition from a high- to low-carbon economy and society.

50th and [5th–95th] percentile values across the pathways falling within a given category as defined in Box SPM.1. For emissions-related columns these values relate to the distribution of all the pathways in that category. Harmonised emissions values are given for consistency with projected global warming outcomes using climate emulators. Based on the assessment of climate emulators in AR6 WGI (WG1 Chapter 7, Box 7.1), two climate emulators are used for the probabilistic assessment of the resulting warming of the pathways. For the ‘Temperature change’ and ‘Likelihood’ columns, the single upper-row values represent the 50th percentile across the pathways in that category and the median [50th percentile] across the warming estimates of the probabilistic MAGICC climate model emulator. For the bracketed ranges, the median warming for every pathway in that category is calculated for each of the two climate model emulators (MAGICC and FaIR). Subsequently, the 5th and 95th percentile values across all pathways for each emulator are calculated.

The future role of hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives will depend on how quickly and how far production technology improves, that is, from electrolysis (‘green’), biogasification, and fossil fuel reforming with CCS (‘blue’) sources. As a general rule, and across all sectors, it is more efficient to use electricity directly and avoid the progressively larger conversion losses from producing hydrogen, ammonia, or constructed low GHG hydrocarbons. What hydrogen does do, however, is add time and space option value to electricity produced using variable clean sources, for use as hydrogen, as stored future electricity via a fuel cell or turbine, or as an industrial feedstock. Furthermore, electrification and hydrogen involve a symbiotic range of general-purpose technologies, such as electric motors, power electronics, heat pumps, batteries, electrolysis, fuel cells, and so on, that have different applications across sectors but cumulative economies of innovation and production scale benefits. Finally, neither electrification nor hydrogen produce local air pollutants at point of end-use.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">For almost 140 years we have primarily produced electricity by burning coal, oil, and gas to drive steam turbines connected to electricity generators. When switching to low-carbon energy sources – renewable sources, nuclear power, and fossil or bioenergy with CCS – electricity is expected to become a more pervasive energy carrier. Electricity is a versatile energy carrier, with much higher end-use efficiencies than fuels, and it can be used directly to avoid conversion losses.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">An increasing reliance on electricity from variable renewable sources, notably wind and solar power, disrupts old concepts and makes many existing guidelines obsolete for power system planning, for example, that specific generation types are needed for baseload, intermediate load, and peak load to follow and meet demand. In future power systems with high shares of variable electricity from renewable sources, system planning and markets will focus more on demand flexibility, grid infrastructure and interconnections, storage on various timelines (on the minute, hourly, overnight and seasonal scale), and increased coupling between the energy sector and the building, transport and industrial sectors. This shifts the focus to energy systems that can handle variable supply rather than always follow demand. Hydrogen may prove valuable to improve the resilience of electricity systems with high penetration of variable renewable electricity. Flexible hydrogen electrolysis, hydrogen power plants and long-duration hydrogen storage may all improve resilience.

There are growing opportunities to implement strategies that drive behavioural change and support the adoption of new transport technology options. <!-- -->{Chapter 5, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.8}</p><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Changes in urban form, behaviour programs, the circular economy, the shared economy, and digitalisation trends can support systemic changes that lead to reductions in demand for transport services or expand the use of more efficient transport modes (</span><span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">high confidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">). </span>Cities can reduce their transport-related fuel consumption by around 25% through combinations of more compact land use and the provision of less car-dependent transport infrastructure.

Some of these methods (like afforestation and soil carbon sequestration) have been practiced for decades to millennia, although not necessarily with the intention to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Conversely, for methods such as DACCS and BECCS, experience is growing but still limited in scale. A categorisation of CDR methods can be based on several criteria, depending on the highlighted characteristics. In this report, the categorisation is focused on the role of CDR methods in the carbon cycle, that is on the removal process (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">land-based biological</span>; <span class="•-Condensed-italic">ocean-based biological</span>; <span class="•-Condensed-italic">geochemical</span>; <span class="•-Condensed-italic">chemical</span>) and on the time scale of storage (<span class="•-Condensed-italic">decades to centuries</span>; <span class="•-Condensed-italic">centuries to millennia</span>; <span class="•-Condensed-italic">10,000 years or longer</span>), the latter being closely linked to different carbon storage media. Within one category (e.g., ocean-based biological CDR) options often differ with respect to other dynamic or context-specific dimensions such as mitigation potential, cost, potential for co-benefits and adverse side effects, and technology readiness level.

As part of ambitious mitigation strategies at global or national levels, gross CDR can fulfil three different roles in complementing emissions abatement: (i) lowering net CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> or GHG emissions in the near term; (ii) counterbalancing ‘hard-to-abate’ residual emissions such as CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> from industrial activities and long-distance transport, or CH<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> and nitrous oxide from agriculture, in order to help reach net zero CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> or GHG emissions in the mid-term; (iii) achieving net negative CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> or GHG emissions in the long term if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions <!-- -->{2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5}<!-- -->.

Potentials in 2050 are estimated using the International Energy Agency’s 2020 World Energy Outlook STEPS (Stated Policy Scenarios) as a baseline. This scenario is based on a sector-by-sector assessment of specific policies in place, as well as those that have been announced by countries by mid-2020. This scenario was selected due to the detailed representation of options across sectors and sub-sectors. The heights of the coloured columns represent the potentials on which there is a high level of agreement in the literature, based on a range of case studies. The range shown by the dots connected by dotted lines represents the highest and lowest potentials reported in the literature which have low to medium levels of agreement. The demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors in the food system has two parts. The economic potential of direct emissions (mostly non-CO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>) demand reduction through socio-cultural factors alone is 1.9 GtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-eq without considering land-use change by diversion of agricultural land from food production to carbon sequestration. If further changes in land use enabled by this change in demand are considered, the indicative potential could reach 7 GtCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-eq. The electricity panel presents separately the mitigation potential from changes in electricity demand and changes associated with enhanced electrification in end-use sectors. Electrification increases electricity demand, while it is avoided though demand-side mitigation strategies. Load management refers to demand-side flexibility that can be achieved through incentive design such as time-of-use pricing/monitoring by artificial intelligence, diversification of storage facilities, and so on. NZE (IEA Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario) is used to compute the impact of end-use sector electrification, while the impact of demand-side response options is based on bottom-up assessments. Dark grey columns show the emissions that cannot be avoided through demand-side mitigation options. The table indicates which demand-side mitigation options are included. Options are categorised according to: socio-cultural factors, infrastructure use, and technology adoption. Figure SPM.7 covers potential of demand-side options for the year 2050. Figure SPM.8 covers both supply- and demand-side options and their potentials for the year 2030. <!-- -->{5.3, Figure 5.7, 5.SM.II}</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">Socio-cultural and lifestyle changes can accelerate climate change mitigation (</span><span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">medium confidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">). </span>Among 60 identified actions that could change individual consumption, individual mobility choices have the largest potential to reduce carbon footprints. <span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>Prioritising <span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB"></span> car-free mobility by walking and cycling and adoption of electric mobility could save 2 tCO<span class="•-Subscript--e-g--for-CO2-etc- CharOverride-4">2</span>-eq cap <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- CharOverride-4">–1</span> yr <span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- CharOverride-4">–1</span>.

A bibliometric search of the literature identified 99,065 peer-reviewed academic papers, based on 34 search queries with content relevant to Chapter 5. This literature is expanding by 15% per year, with twice as many publications in the AR6 period (2014–2020) as in all previous years.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">The models of stakeholders’ decisions assessed by IPCC have continuously evolved. From AR1 to AR4, rational choice was the implicit assumption: agents with perfect information and unlimited processing capacity maximising self-focused expected utility and differing only in wealth, risk attitude, and time discount rate. The AR5 introduced a broader range of goals (material, social, and psychological) and decision processes (calculation-based, affect-based, and rule-based processes). However, its perspective was still individual- and agency-focused, neglecting structural, cultural, and institutional constraints and the influence of physical and social context.</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">A social science perspective is important in two ways. By adding new actors and perspectives, it (i) provides more options for climate mitigation; and (ii) helps to identify and address important social and cultural barriers and opportunities to socio-economic, technological, and institutional change. Demand-side mitigation involves five sets of social actors: individuals (e.g., consumption choices, habits), groups and collectives (e.g., social movements, values), corporate actors (e.g., investments, advertising), institutions (e.g., political agency, regulations), and infrastructure actors (e.g., very long-term investments and financing). Actors either contribute to the status-quo of global high-carbon consumption, and a GDP growth-oriented economy, or help generate the desired change to a low-carbon energy-services, well-being, and equity-oriented economy. Each set of actors has novel implications for the design and implementation of both demand- and supply-side mitigation policies. They show important synergies, making energy demand mitigation a dynamic problem where the packaging and/or sequencing of different policies play a role in their effectiveness <!-- -->{5.5, 5.6}<!-- -->. Incremental interventions change social practices, simultaneously affecting emissions and well-being. The transformative change requires coordinated action across all five sets of actors (Table 5.4), using social science insights about intersection of behaviour, culture, institutional and infrastructural changes for policy design and implementation. <span class="•-Condensed-italic">Avoid</span>, <span class="•-Condensed-italic">Shift </span>, and <span class="•-Condensed-italic">Improve</span> choices by individuals, households and communities support mitigation <!-- -->{5.3.1.1, Table 5.1}<!-- -->.

Arguments against the Paris Agreement are that it lacks a mechanism to review the adequacy of individual Parties’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), that collectively current NDCs are inconsistent in their level of ambition with achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal, that its processes will not lead to sufficiently rising levels of ambition in the NDCs, and that NDCs will not be achieved because the targets, policies and measures they contain are not legally binding at the international level. To some extent, arguments on both sides are aligned with different analytic frameworks, including assumptions about the main barriers to mitigation that international cooperation can help overcome.

Yet despite these initiatives, climate-related financial risks remain greatly underestimated by financial institutions and markets, limiting the capital reallocation needed for the low-carbon transition. Moreover, risks relating to national and international inequity – which act as a barrier to the transformation – are not yet reflected in decisions by the financial community.

In modelled pathways, regional investments are projected to occur when and where they are cost cost-effective to limit global warming. The model quantifications help to identify high-priority areas for cost-effective investments, but do not provide any indication on who would finance the regional investments. Investment requirements and flows covering downstream / mitigation technology deployment only. Data includes investments with a direct mitigation effect, and in the case of electricity, additional transmission and distribution investments. See section 15.4.2 Quantitative assessment of financing needs for detailed data on investment requirements. Data on mitigation investment flows are based on a single series of reports (Climate Policy Initiative, CPI) which assembles data from multiple sources. Investment flows for energy efficiency are adjusted based on data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Data on mitigation investments do not include technical assistance (i.e., policy and national budget support or capacity building), other non-technology deployment financing. Adaptation only flows are also excluded. Data on mitigation investment requirements for electricity are based on emission pathways C1, C2 and C3 (Table SPM.1). For electricity investment requirements, the upper end refers to the mean of C1 pathways and the lower end to the mean of C3 pathways. Data points for energy efficiency, transport and AFOLU cannot always be linked to C1–C3 scenarios. Data do not include needs for adaptation or general infrastructure investment or investment related to meeting the SDGs other than mitigation, which may be at least partially required to facilitate mitigation. The multiplication factors show the ratio of average annual model-based mitigation investment requirements (2020–2030) and most recent annual mitigation investments (averaged for 2017–2020). The lower and upper multiplication factors refer to the lower and upper ends of the range of investment needs.</p><p class="Figures--tables-etc_•-Figure-table-note---no-title" lang="en-US">Given the multiple sources and lack of harmonised methodologies, the data can only be indicative of the size and pattern of investment gaps. The gap between most recent flows and required investments is only a single indicator. A more comprehensive (and qualitative) assessment is required in order to understand the magnitude of the challenge of scaling up investment in sectors and regions. The analysis also does not consider the effects of misaligned flows. <!-- -->{15.3, 15.4, 15.5, Table 15.2, Table 15.3, Table 15.4}</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">The relatively slow implementation of commitments by countries and stakeholders in the financial sector to scale up climate finance reflects neither the urgent need for ambitious climate action, nor the economic rationale for ambitious climate action (</span><span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic--dark-blue-">high confidence</span><span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">) </span> <span class="•-Bold-condensed--dark-blue-">. </span><span class="•-Bold-Condensed-Italic"></span>Delayed climate investments and financing – and limited alignment of investment activity with the Paris Agreement – will result in significant carbon lock-ins, stranded assets, and other additional costs.

Governance can ensure that digitalisation not only reduces GHG emissions intensity but also contributes to reducing absolute GHG emission, constraining run-away consumption. <!-- -->{Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 16, 16.2}</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Digital technologies have the potential to reduce energy demand in all end-use sectors through steep improvements in energy efficiency. This includes material input savings and increased coordination as they allow the use of fewer inputs to perform a given task. Smart appliances and energy management, supported by choice architectures, economic incentives and social norms, effectively reduce energy demand and associated GHG emissions by 5–10% while maintaining equal service levels. Data centres can also play a role in energy-system management, for example by waste-heat utilisation where district heat systems are close by; temporal and spatial scheduling of electricity demand can provide about 6% of the total potential demand response. <!-- -->{5.5, Cross-Chapter Box 11, Table 1 in Chapter 16}</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">Digital technologies, analytics and connectivity consume large amounts of energy, implying higher direct energy demand and related carbon emissions. Global energy demand from digital appliances reached 7.14 EJ in 2018. The demand for computing services increased by 550% between 2010 and 2018 and is now estimated at 1% of global electricity consumption. Due to efficiency improvements, the associated energy demand increased only modestly, by about 6% from 2000 to 2018. <!-- -->{Box 9.5}</p><p class="Body-copy_Boxes_Blue-Boxes_•-Box-body" lang="en-GB">System-wide effects endanger energy and GHG-emission savings. Rising demand can diminish energy savings, and also produce run-away effects associated with additional consumption and GHG emissions if left unregulated. Savings are varied in smart and shared mobility systems, as ride-hailing increases GHG emissions due to deadheading, whereas shared pooled mobility and shared cycling reduce GHG emissions, as occupancy levels and/or weight per person kilometre transported improve. Systemic effects have wider boundaries of analysis and are more difficult to quantify and investigate but are nonetheless very relevant. Systemic effects tend to have negative impacts, but policies and adequate infrastructures and choice architectures can help manage and contain these. <!-- -->{5.3, 5.4, 5.6}</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="TS.7"><h1 class="Headings_•-H1---numbered" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">TS.7</span> <span class="•-Bold-condensed" lang="en-GB">Mitigation in the Context of Sustainable Development </span></h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-7-siblings"><p class="Body-copy_•-Body-copy--full-justify-" lang="en-GB">Accelerating climate mitigation <span class="•-Condensed-italic">in the context of sustainable development </span> involves not only expediting the pace of change but also addressing the underlying drivers of vulnerability and emissions.

Estimates of substitution effects of bioenergy indicate that this additional mitigation would be of the same magnitude as provided through CDR using BECCS. Bio-based products with long service life, for example, construction timber, can also provide mitigation through substitution of steel, concrete, and other products, and through carbon storage in the bio-based product pool. See section TS.5.7 for the CDR potential of BECCS. <!-- -->{7.4, 12.3}</p></div><div class="_idFootnote" id="footnote-003"><p class="Body-copy_•-Footnotes" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="ts.html#footnote-003-backlink">30</a> </span>As a median value [5–95th percentile range].</p></div><div class="_idFootnote" id="footnote-002"><p class="Body-copy_•-Footnotes" lang="en-GB"><span class="•-Superscript--e-g--footnote-refs-in-text- _idGenCharOverride-1"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="ts.html#footnote-002-backlink">31</a> </span>Most of climate finance stays within national borders, especially private climate flows (over 90%).
