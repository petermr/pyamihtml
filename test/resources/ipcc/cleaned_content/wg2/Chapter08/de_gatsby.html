This chapter assesses the societal consequences of climate change and related hazards in terms of adverse and irreversible consequences for the most vulnerable. To understand societal consequences of climate change, we assess impacts through the perspective of vulnerability, poverty and livelihoods of people. We identify why climate events trigger sudden and slow-onset disasters, and how the most severe, acute and chronic impacts cause and deepen human suffering. We also examine issues of climate justice. Understanding and engaging with climate justice requires a plural focus on the historical social and institutional relations and inequalities that produce climate change, cause people to be vulnerable to climate hazards and shape responses to them (<a class="reference-link" href="#Newell--2021">Newell et al., 2021</a>). An assessment of observed impacts on the poorest and their strategies for adaptation carries important lessons for inclusive, broad-based solutions to climate change. </span></p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span lang="en-US">As a starting point, this chapter examines linkages between climate change, specific climate-related hazards and impacts on multidimensional poverty, vulnerability and livelihoods. Past assessments have identified the linkages between climate change, poverty, livelihoods and human vulnerability, and shown how climate change leads to differential consequences for different communities and populations. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) identified socially and geographically disadvantaged people exposed to persistent inequalities at the intersection of various dimensions of discrimination based on gender, age, ethnicity, class and caste (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>). AR5 also showed evidence that climate change is a universal driver and multiplier of risk that shapes dynamic interactions between these factors. Climate change is one stressor that shapes dynamic and differential livelihood trajectories. Also, the IPCC Special 1.5°C Report (IPCC SR 1.5°C) underscored with</span><span class="condensed_italic" lang="en-US">very high confidence</span><span lang="en-US">that global mean temperature, harm and human well-being losses are increasing substantially (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hoegh-Guldberg--2018">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al., 2018</a>). </span></p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This chapter builds on this, examining equitable development, robust institutions and poverty reduction as essential inputs to societies’ capacity for adaptation (i.e., closes the adaptation gap) in order to avoid losses and damages (L&amp;Ds) from climate change. It assesses quantitative spatio-temporal information on human vulnerability at a global scale and for specific sub-regions, livelihood groups and communities at the local level. The chapter assesses the newest literature on how multidimensional poverty and human vulnerability to climate change is measured and also examined the agreement of different index systems in terms of global hotspots of human vulnerability.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In addition, the chapter explores how climate change affects different livelihoods and livelihood assets and also examines factors that characterise vulnerability to climate change, focusing on different dimensions of human vulnerability and its subsystems (e.g., access to infrastructure services). In this context the chapter also assesses quantitative data to map human vulnerability as well as economic and non-economic losses that are highly relevant for understanding adverse impacts of climate change.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The chapter assesses the newest scientific knowledge on how the most vulnerable and marginalised people are experiencing different climate-influenced hazards and changes, how these groups prepare for and adapt to these changes. Hence, it examines how climate change intersects with broader processes of development. It also considers the various impacts of climate change on the livelihoods of the poorest, the capabilities, assets and activities required for a means of living. It examines the institutional conditions that promote livelihood resilience in the face of climate change. Quantitative analysis and qualitative data on observed adverse climate change impacts and future projections and trends in vulnerability show that societal impacts of climate change cannot solely be explained by looking at temperature changes or climatic hazards alone.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The chapter provides due consideration of how societal impacts of climate change are emerging as a result of climatic changes, development and vulnerability. In this regard, it also explores how past and present conditions of poverty, inequality and vulnerability determine observed and future societal impacts of climate change, including future adaptive capacities of societies exposed to climate change. It highlights new entry points to address climate risks and adaptation needs through the targeted reduction of poverty, inequity and vulnerability, linking particularly global quantitative information with local livelihood-orientated qualitative information.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The chapter outlines new approaches for identifying social tipping points, meaning moments of rapid, destabilising change across scales that can complement the discussion about physical tipping points in the climate system. It also addresses new perspectives on the baselines for assessing future vulnerabilities, and the potential for irreversible losses, emphasising not only economic but also non-economic losses, which are linked to past and present development trajectories. There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span> on non-economic losses, including the loss of land, livelihoods, social networks, cultural values and the irreversible degradation of ecosystem functions, as observed, for example, in parts of the Amazon. Non-economic losses are intertwined with economic losses to influence human health, nutrition, well-being and social stability, and therefore also influence present and future vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities. Non-economic losses from climate change disproportionately affect the poor. People in vulnerable situations are often disproportionately affected as they are less resilient and have less access to institutional support (including protection mechanisms) and coping strategies. This knowledge is key for informing integrated strategies for sustainable livelihood transitions and adaptation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span lang="en-US">The chapter assesses newer literature about the synergies and trade-offs for the poorest and most vulnerable people and groups between adaptation–mitigation and sustainable development strategies, which societies must negotiate in order to pursue climate resilient development. It explores synergies and mismatches in key development sectors that the poorest rely on, including agriculture, forestry and energy. It identifies the development strategies, elements of institutional design and financial mechanisms that could support risk reduction and adaptation. Our assessment reveals that successful adaptation is not solely a question of levels of funding, but depends on broader institutional design that determine societal development and enabling conditions for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. An assessment of enabling conditions for adaptation supports the finding that more convergent, integrated and comprehensive approaches to adaptation are needed. The chapter concludes that climate justice requires consideration of the legal, institutional and governance frameworks that significantly determine whether adaptation is successful in addressing the needs of the poor. </span></p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Thus, intersections between climate hazards and socioeconomic development are assessed from the point of view of vulnerability, poverty, livelihoods and inequality (see Figure 8.1). <a class="section-link" data-title="Poverty, livelihoods and sustainable development" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8">Chapter 8</a> adopts this wider perspective to examine the differential nature of observed and future disproportionate vulnerabilities (i.e., who is most susceptible to climate hazards and events, where, at the core to understanding of what scale and why?), as well as the inequalities inherent in adaptation and mitigation solutions as part of a wider climate justice perspective adopted in Chapter 8, and challenges for climate resilient development.</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer004"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" id="figure-8-001" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_8_001.png"></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title ParaOverride-7" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 8.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>The lens of <a class="section-link" data-title="Poverty, livelihoods and sustainable development" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8">Chapter 8</a> to better understand the human dimension of climate change at the nexus of climate change, climate hazards and socio­economic development. </span></p></div><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Finally, our assessment points towards the fact that human vulnerability to climate change is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that is often influenced by historic development processes, such as structures that originated with colonisation.

Evidence suggests that responses to the impacts of climate change should consider the physical climate event, and also historical and institutional root causes that make people or systems vulnerable. However, addressing structural vulnerability must be balanced with the political context and the range of options available to people, communities or countries (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Human Vulnerability, Spatial Hotspots, Observed Loss and Damage, and Livelihood Challenges" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.3">Section 8.3</a>). Political frameworks need to consider both types of responses, to revive democratic debate and citizenship (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pepermans--2016">Pepermans et al., 2016</a>). In addition to reducing poverty and vulnerability, planned climate change responses must also be intersectoral, in order to increase their effectiveness. This requires higher levels of vertical and horizontal coordination and integration (<a class="reference-link" href="#GIZ--2019">GIZ, 2019</a>). Horizontal coordination encompasses, for example, the integrated coordination of responses to climate change across different sectors, which requires suitable governance structures and processes that allow for such a coordination (<a class="reference-link" href="#Di%20Gregorio--2017">Di Gregorio et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Burch--2019">Burch et al., 2019</a>). Vertical integration is needed in order to ensure that effective responses also include different levels of governance and benefit from knowledge at different scales. The inclusion of local knowledge within national or provincial adaptation strategies requires such linkages and vertical coordination. Overall, there is an increasing body of literature that highlights the importance of improved integration and coordination also in order to promote a higher effectiveness of strategies and an improved consideration of social justice and climate justice when designing and implementing responses (<a class="reference-link" href="#Levy--2015">Levy and Patz, 2015</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">However, evaluating the effectiveness, social impacts and social justice of climate change responses is not uniform across locations, nations and regions for three principal reasons:</p><ul><li class="Body_Lists_List_unnumbered-first" lang="en-GB">Temporal dimensions of responses: effective and appropriate climate change responses require that strategies and responses are tested in a specific context and that ongoing learning and adaptive management is a necessary to avoid maladaptation or other unintended consequences (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eriksen--2021">Eriksen et al., 2021</a>),</li><li class="Body_Lists_List_unnumbered-continued" lang="en-GB">Goal of responses: responses may have distinct and locally specific goals, such as reducing vulnerability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sarker--2019">Sarker et al., 2019</a>), which is distinct from increasing resilience (<a class="reference-link" href="#Alam--2018">Alam et al., 2018</a>).

This category of response is known as maladaptation. Maladaptation actions defined in the IPCC SR1.5°C (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018b">IPCC, 2018b</a>) and in the Land Report (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019a">IPCC, 2019a</a>) are the ones that usually have unintended consequences, and can lead to increased negative risk to poor population mostly in the Global South to climate hazards by either increasing GHG emissions or by increasing the vulnerabilities to climate change with diminished welfare, now and in the near future (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al., 2018</a>). For example, migration to urban centres can represent a significant adaptation opportunity for the migrants themselves, but can also increase the vulnerability of their community of origin or destination (e.g., through a depletion of the workforce or an addition pressure on environmental resources and infrastructure respectively) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gemenne--2017">Gemenne and Blocher, 2017</a>). Some types of observed responses to climate change may not yield long-term benefits. For example, food imports during droughts or adverse climate conditions are not a fully adequate response, since they may alleviate a problem on the one hand (i.e., an imminent food shortage due to crop failure) but, on the other, lead to no long-lasting improvements in physical conditions and create new dependencies that can increase vulnerability in the long run (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zimmermann--2018">Zimmermann et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In the AR5, the maladaptation outcomes emerge when climate change impacts and risks are disproportionately born by the poorest populations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Olsson--2014">Olsson et al., 2014</a>). Since then, most maladaptation evidence emerges as a consequence of failure to address root causes of vulnerabilities that emerge under high and multiple forms of inequalities. In fact, the literature shows that adaptation practices can indeed redistribute vulnerabilities and increase risks to already poor and marginalised people with risk to maladaptation outcomes mainly in the Global South countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Atteridge--2018">Atteridge and Remling, 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The maladaptation outcomes also emerge when responses are not equitable at the policy level, and exacerbate the precarity of vulnerable populations by excluding them from benefits and support, while attending to the needs of people of the most enfranchised segments of society (<a class="reference-link" href="#Thomas--2019">Thomas and Warner, 2019</a>; Asplund and Hjerpe 2020).

Documented cases of maladaptation (see <a class="reference-link" href="#Eriksen--2021">Eriksen et al., 2021</a>) hint that responses to climate change can exacerbate existing inequality in some cases and may discourage other types of responses (see also Sections 8.5; 8.6).

This is particularly the case in rapidly growing medium-sized cities in Africa that at present do not have sufficient resources to cope and adapt, and to implement climate-sensitive land use planning (<a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2016">Birkmann et al., 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Tables 8.1 and 8.2 present a summary of a set of common climate change responses observed, classified according to their main approach.

examines the mutual reinforcement of climate change impacts and structural inequalities. There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span> that negative impacts and harm posed by climate change are also a result of social and political processes and existing structural inequalities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sealey-Huggins--2018">Sealey-Huggins, 2018</a>). Climate change encompasses unevenly distributed impacts on women, youth, elderly, Indigenous Peoples, communities of colour, urban poor and socially excluded groups, exacerbated by unequal distribution of resources and poor access for some (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rufat--2015">Rufat et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McNeeley--2017">McNeeley, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sealey-Huggins--2018">Sealey-Huggins, 2018</a>). Structurally disadvantaged people, who are subject to social, economic and political inequalities resulting historically from discrimination, marginality or disenfranchisement because of gender, age, ethnicity, class, language, ability and/or sexual orientation, are disproportionately vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kaijser--2014">Kaijser and Kronsell, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Otto--2016">Otto et al., 2016</a>). High levels of vulnerability at national scale (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Human Vulnerability, Spatial Hotspots, Observed Loss and Damage, and Livelihood Challenges" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.3">Section 8.3</a>) are often linked to complex histories, including long-term economic dependencies established and reinforced in the context of colonisation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Links between climate change, structural racism and development are less well established as an element of disproportionate impacts of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sealey-Huggins--2018">Sealey-Huggins, 2018</a>). Discrimination is not restricted to structural racism and includes discrimination of all kinds, including that of gender and caste, because of which a considerable population is directly bound to suffer the harsh impacts of the climate change. The climate change and gender literature has come a long way in demonstrating concrete examples of how structural inequalities operate. The political and micro-political aspects and how they interact with structural inequalities are also important to understand vulnerability. <a class="reference-link" href="#Henrique--2020">Henrique and Tschakert (2020)</a> shows how the many adaptation efforts benefit powerful actors, while further entrenching the poor and disadvantaged in cycles of dispossession. This critical analysis recommends acknowledging injustices, embracing deliberation and nurturing responsibility for human and more-than-human others. Garcia et al. (2020) describes the socio-political drivers of gendered inequalities that produce discriminatory opportunities for adaptation. They use an intersectional subjectivities lens to examine how entrenched power dynamics and social norms related to gender create barriers to adaptation, such as lack of resources and agency. The analysis shows a pronounced dichotomy as women experience the brunt of these barriers and a persistent power imbalance that positions them as ‘less able’ to adapt than men.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Historical marginality and exclusion are context-specific conditions that shape vulnerability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Leichenko--2014">Leichenko and Silva, 2014</a>). There is also <span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span> that gender inequalities contribute to climate vulnerability, and that consideration of gender is a key approach to climate justice (see Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18). There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span> for the differentiated impacts of climate change and climate-orientated policies on women (<a class="reference-link" href="#McOmber--2020">McOmber, 2020</a>). For example, Friedman et al. (2019) show that, in Ghana, homogeneous representations of women farmers and a technical focus of climate-orientated policy interventions may threaten to further marginalise the most vulnerable and exacerbate existing inequalities. Climate change impacts can also heighten existing gender inequalities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jost--2016">Jost et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Glazebrook--2020">Glazebrook et al., 2020</a>). On the one hand, climate change impacts can be gendered as a result of customary roles in society, such as triple workloads for women (i.e., economic labour, household and family labour, and duties of community participation), and occupational hazards from gendered work indoors and outdoors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Murray--2016">Murray et al., 2016</a>). On the other, climate change hazards interact with changing gender roles in society, such as urban migration of both men and women in ways that break with tradition (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bhatta--2016">Bhatta et al., 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Gender influences the way that people also experience loss and process psychological and emotional distress of losses, such as mortality of children and other relatives in climate-related disasters (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chandra--2017">Chandra et al., 2017</a>).Women’s capacities are often constrained due to their roles in their household and society, institutional barriers and social norms. These constraints result in low adaptive capacity of women, which make them more vulnerable to hazards. As more men seek employment opportunities away from home, women are required to acquire new capacities to manage new challenges, including risks from climate change. <a class="reference-link" href="#Banerjee--2019b">Banerjee et al. (2019b)</a> finds that capacity-building interventions for women staying behind, which aimed to strengthen autonomous adaptation measures (e.g. precautionary savings and flood preparedness), also positively influenced women to approach formal institutions. Besides, the intervention households were more likely to invest a part of the precautionary savings in flood preparedness measures than control households.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Next to the direct differential impacts of climate change on different social groups, the impacts of climate change can also exacerbate inequality due to the lower access and limited ability to benefit from services provided by ecosystems. Marginalised poor people often significantly depend on the access to surrounding environments, natural resources and ecosystem services for their livelihoods, for leisure or cultural practices. Thus shifts in such resources, for example, due to the bleaching of coral reefs or shifts in fish stock, also cause severe challenges and risks to these communities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Leal%20Filho--2018">Leal Filho, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Le--2019">Le, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNTTSDCC--2014">UNTTSDCC, 2014</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Overall, the assessed literature highlights that climate change impacts are not emerging in isolation from development context and development pathways. Economic and social ramifications mean that they may exacerbate poverty and marginalisation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Finkbeiner--2018">Finkbeiner et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dogru--2019">Dogru et al., 2019</a>). Choudhary et al. (2019) and <a class="reference-link" href="#Orimoloye--2019">Orimoloye et al. (2019)</a> highlight how the effects of climate change can be even more prejudicial to poor countries, which, in most cases, already suffer from weak governance, high prevalence of informal settlements and lack of resources. Health, livelihood assets and economy are examples of aspects that will worsen as a result of the negative impacts of climate change and failure to provide opportunities for sustainable adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#United%20Nations--2015">United Nations, 2015</a>). These facts highlight the importance of mitigation and adaptation measures especially in these regions characterised by high levels of vulnerability (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Human Vulnerability, Spatial Hotspots, Observed Loss and Damage, and Livelihood Challenges" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.3">Section 8.3</a>).</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-8.3"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 8.3 | COVID-19 pandemic</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-22-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">During the COVID-19 pandemic, countries such as India were affected by hydro-meteorological hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Raju--2020">Raju, 2020</a>) making it extremely difficult to handle a public health crisis in the context of compounding risks and cascading hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Phillips--2020">Phillips et al., 2020</a>). The COVID-19 pandemic can increase the adverse consequences of climate change since it has the potential to delay some key adaptation actions. On the other hand, the pandemic also highlights the importance of better preparedness to the impacts of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Djalante--2020">Djalante et al., 2020</a>). Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the economic situation within many countries and local communities particularly for already marginalised groups (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gupta--2021">Gupta et al., 2021</a>). The accumulation of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic alongside climate change impacts, underscore the fact that stressors do not occur in isolation, but are interlinked, with clear implications for structural vulnerability and adaptation options available to the poorest (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sultana--2021">Sultana, 2021</a>). Responses to COVID-19 have led to significant economic and social distress within and across societies and local communities, especially in poorer countries. The direct health and economic impacts of the lockdowns have further limited the ability of many people across the developing world to pursue income-generating activities, and sustain livelihoods that are already affected by climate hazards. In addition, poor or most vulnerable groups face further marginalisation due to misinformation that these groups transmit the virus to other wealthier groups and areas. The pandemic has intensified inequalities in both developing countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#FAO--2020">FAO, 2020</a>) and in industrialised nations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Anderson--2020">Anderson et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McCloskey--2020">McCloskey et al., 2020</a>), whereby vulnerable groups are especially affected (<a class="reference-link" href="#Raju--2021">Raju et al., 2021</a>). Whereas different models and scenarios contain different data and figures, there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span> that it is likely that socioeconomic impacts are particularly severe within selected global regions and areas that are already characterised by a rather high level of human vulnerability (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Human Vulnerability, Spatial Hotspots, Observed Loss and Damage, and Livelihood Challenges" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.3">Section 8.3</a>). This also implies that the capacity of people to prepare for present and future climate change impacts will further decrease within these countries and population groups under the direct and indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic is not only influencing climate change research (<a class="reference-link" href="#Leal%20Filho--2021b">Leal Filho et al., 2021b</a>) but is also influencing the capacities of governmental institutions and nations to support planned adaptation and poverty reduction favouring the most vulnerable groups, since the crisis also means among other issues a significant reductions in tax revenues (<a class="reference-link" href="#Clemens--2020">Clemens and Veuger, 2020</a>). COVID-19 may also force people to seek alternative sources of income that can lead to the further erosion of long-term adaptive capacities. In many settings, the pandemic has had significant impact on businesses and SMEs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schmid--2021">Schmid et al., 2021</a>). The important role of governmental support for buffering crises and periods of income loss of individual households (e.g., unemployment) and private businesses (e.g., SMEs) has also been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2020b">OECD, 2020b</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Livelihood disruptions and an increasing probability of higher levels of poverty and of structural vulnerability in various countries have already been observed (<a class="reference-link" href="#Laborde--2020b">Laborde et al., 2020b</a>).

The triggering of conflicts related to climate impacts is strongly determined by contextual factors, such as the type of government or the level of development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2019">Mach et al., 2019</a>). A study of 156 countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Abel--2019">Abel et al., 2019</a>) showed that an increase in periods of drought exacerbate the risk of conflict, especially in democratic countries. This influence was particularly marked during the period 2010–2012 in countries of western Asia and northern Africa that were undergoing political transformations, such as the Arab Spring. Conflict can then represent people’s discontent in governments’ inefficient responses to climate impacts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Abel--2019">Abel et al., 2019</a>).

To avoid impoverishment, households often pursue risky livelihood alternatives, with high potential for return on investment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sovacool--2018">Sovacool et al., 2018</a>), but which in some cases undermine environmental quality (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bolognesi--2015">Bolognesi et al., 2015</a>), violate laws (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ahmed--2019">Ahmed et al., 2019</a>), contradict social norms (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hagerman--2014">Hagerman and Satterfield, 2014</a>), erode institutions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sovacool--2018">Sovacool et al., 2018</a>), or affect intra- and inter-community cooperation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nadiruzzaman--2015">Nadiruzzaman and Wrathall, 2015</a>).

The analysis of recent literature underscores that climate change impacts and adaptation needs cannot be understood by looking at climate change only.

Even though these assessments fall short of measuring the real costs of addressing climate change impacts (see <a class="reference-link" href="#DeFries--2019">DeFries et al., 2019</a>), they often support the definition of priorities in terms of protecting economic values and assets. However, these assessments do not sufficiently account for how climate change impacts and imposes risks on poor people, nor do they capture issues of climate justice and more complex societal impacts and future risks. For example, various observed losses in the context of climate change cannot be sufficiently expressed in terms of an economic value (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Economic and Non-economic Losses and Damages Due to Climate Change and their Implications for Livelihoods and Livelihood Shifts" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.3.5">Section 8.3.5</a>), but these items or assets are highly relevant for various people with limited economic resources (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hallegatte--2017">Hallegatte et al., 2017</a>). Consequently, the assessment of risks from climate change facing particularly poor people requires comprehensive assessments of human vulnerability, resilience and the impacts of climate change on human well-being going beyond a simple temperature–societal-impact understanding. Knowledge about methods and approaches to assess human or human–environmental vulnerability and livelihood security, including aspects of intersectionality, is important in order to explore whether or not adaptation and development programmes are able to reduce vulnerability. The body of literature on these issues has grown significantly since the AR5 publication (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Moser--2014">Moser, 2014</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This literature underscores that approaches to assess resilience, vulnerability and human well-being include global assessments that can inform strategies and priority settings for adaptation and risk reduction in the context of climate change (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#WHO--2014b">WHO, 2014b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Young--2015">Young et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Feldmeyer--2017">Feldmeyer et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#GIZ%20and%20BMZ--2017">GIZ and BMZ, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hallegatte--2017">Hallegatte et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2021a">Birkmann et al., 2021a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Garschagen--2021">Garschagen et al., 2021</a>; Toolkit, 2021).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">These quantitative global assessments that have emerged within the last decades have not been sufficiently assessed in former IPCC reports, for example, in terms of the agreement on spatial hotspots or in terms of regional clusters of vulnerability and the linkages between past societal impacts and levels of vulnerability.

These factors and context conditions also influence individual vulnerability at household or community level. Access to basic services, such as water and sanitation, are linked to human rights and if not granted increase the likelihood that people disproportionately suffer from climate-induced hazards, due to their pre-existing lack of access to such services. In addition, increasing climate hazards further constrain the access to such services (<a class="reference-link" href="#United%20Nations--2018">United Nations, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kohlitz--2019">Kohlitz et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gupta--2020">Gupta et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There is an increasing evidence base that successful adaptation and risk reduction strategies need to acknowledge not only climate change and/or specific climate hazards (sea level rise, flooding, droughts, etc.), but also human vulnerability and existing adaptation gaps and thereby the different starting points that societies or different groups have towards climate resilience (see <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2016">UNEP, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2021a">Birkmann et al., 2021a</a>). Recent reports underscore that development and capacity indicators are useful to assess the broader adaptation challenges and adaptive capacities at global scale independent of a specific climatic hazard. Examples include the percentage of population with access to improved water sources and improved sanitation, the number of physicians per 1000 people or the dependency ratio (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2018">UNEP, 2018</a>). These indicators are also part of more comprehensive vulnerability assessments, such as those assessed within this section namely the vulnerability components of the INFORM risk index (e.g., INFORM, 2019) and of the WorldRiskIndex (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2016">Birkmann and Welle, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2021a">Birkmann et al., 2021a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Feldmeyer--2021">Feldmeyer et al., 2021</a>). Recent literature underscores that measuring vulnerability is key for assessing factors that significantly determine actual and future adverse consequences of climate change and complex risks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cutter--2008">Cutter and Finch, 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cardona--2012">Cardona et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Sherbinin--2019">de Sherbinin et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Peters--2019">Peters et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jamshed--2020c">Jamshed et al., 2020c</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Visser--2020">Visser et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Feldmeyer--2021">Feldmeyer et al., 2021</a>). However, there is also important critique on indicator-based assessments of vulnerability (see <a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Sherbinin--2019">de Sherbinin et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rufat--2019">Rufat et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Visser--2020">Visser et al., 2020</a>), particularly with regard to issues of validation and its use in decision-making processes. Nevertheless, we observe an emerging agreement in the literature that resilience building and adaptation to climate change has to be informed by climate and multidimensional assessment of the vulnerability of people, different groups and coupled human–environmental systems, including both quantitative and qualitative assessment approaches (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014b">IPCC, 2014b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2018">UNEP, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Singleton--2021">Singleton et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2022">Birkmann et al., 2022</a>). Since, interdependencies between regional (supranational/sub-continental), national, community and individual vulnerability have often been overlooked, this chapter assesses both global and regional vulnerability, as well as local livelihood vulnerabilities.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">While past research regarding the nexus between climate change and poverty often focused on vulnerable groups in rural areas of low-income countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Sherbinin--2014">de Sherbinin, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Barbier--2018">Barbier and Hochard, 2018</a>), new global mega-trends, such as urbanisation, underscore the need to assess both rural and urban communities and their vulnerability. In many rapidly growing cities in the Global South, access to land and to housing is a challenge, particularly for the poor and marginalised, contributing to a further increase in informal settlements that often emerge in highly hazard-exposed areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jeschonnek--2014">Jeschonnek et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rana--2021">Rana et al., 2021</a>). In addition, migration from rural areas to urban centres, also due to increasing adverse impacts of climate change on rural livelihoods, can add another level of complexity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Flavell--2020">Flavell et al., 2020</a>). Moreover, the context in which such urbanisation processes take place is key. For example, rapidly growing medium-sized cities, for example in West Africa, often do not have sufficient financial, technical and institutional resources to adapt urban structures to climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2016">Birkmann and Welle, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2016">Birkmann et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Sherbinin--2017">de Sherbinin et al., 2017</a>). Hence, vulnerability in urban contexts is an emerging issue for international, national and local adaptation programmes. Rather than focusing on mega-cities and their exposure as primary hotspots, more attention has to be given to rapidly growing small- and medium-sized cities and their adaptation needs from the perspective of vulnerability reduction and poverty.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="8.3.2"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">8.3.2 Global Hotspots of Human Vulnerability to Climate Change <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-5-siblings"><div class="h3-container" id="8.3.2.1"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">8.3.2.1 Hotspots and Spatial Patterns of Multidimensional Vulnerability <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-10-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The assessment of literature published since the AR5 suggests that alongside already deteriorated specific conditions that determine individual vulnerability and livelihood security to climate change (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Detection and Attribution of Observed Impacts and Responses" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.2">Section 8.2</a>), high levels of poverty, lack of access to basic services (human rights to water and sanitation), poor governance and conflicts are important factors that characterise vulnerability and systemic human vulnerability in particular (EC-DRMKC, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wisner--2020">Wisner, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Feldmeyer--2021">Feldmeyer et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Garschagen--2021">Garschagen et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#GIZ--2021">GIZ, 2021</a>).

Areas shaded light yellow are on average the least vulnerable and those shaded darker red are the most vulnerable. The map combines information about the level of vulnerability (independent of the population size) with the population density (see legend) to show where both high vulnerability and high population density coincide. The map reveals that there are densely populated areas of the world that are highly vulnerable, but also highly vulnerable populations in more sparsely populated areas. There are also highly vulnerable communities and populations in countries with overall low vulnerability as shown with local case studies alongside the map. The pie charts show the number of deaths (mortality) per hazard (storm, flood, drought, heatwaves and wildfires) event per continental region based on EM-DAT Data (<a class="reference-link" href="#CRED--2020">CRED, 2020</a>). The size of the pie chart represents the average mortality per hazard event while slices of each pie chart show the absolute number of deaths from each hazard. This reveals that over the past decade, there were significantly more fatalities per hazard in the more vulnerable regions, e.g., Africa and Asia. The analysis of the data shown in this map revealed that over 3.3 billion people are living in countries classified as very highly and highly vulnerable, while approximately 1.8 billion people live in countries with low and very low vulnerability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2022">Birkmann et al., 2022</a>). These vulnerability values are based on the average of the vulnerability components of the INFORM Index (INFORM, 2019) and WorldRiskIndex (<a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2016">Birkmann and Welle, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Feldmeyer--2017">Feldmeyer et al., 2017</a>) with updated data from 2019 classified into five classes using the quantile method. Other studies applied more vulnerability classes within their assessment and therefore provide slightly different numbers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2021a">Birkmann et al., 2021a</a>).

This figure provides a more differentiated picture about the various dimensions of vulnerability that different regions and countries face and the severity of such challenges in each region. Such vulnerability challenges increase the risk of severe adverse impacts of climate change and related hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2022">Birkmann et al., 2022</a>).</p></div><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">However, it is also important to note that vulnerability assessments do have their limitations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Heesen--2014">Heesen et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rufat--2019">Rufat et al., 2019</a>). For example, in high-income countries, specific groups can be highly vulnerable to climate change due to marginalisation and discrimination due to ethnicity or gender. Gender inequality, for example, is also high in some countries classified in the literature as having low vulnerability (see <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2021a">Birkmann et al., 2021a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2022">Birkmann et al., 2022</a>). Nevertheless, these countries have, in theory, sufficient financial resources and governance capacities to deal with these challenges, while this is different for many country clusters classified as highly vulnerable.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify ParaOverride-3" lang="en-GB">Countries and regional clusters with low vulnerability (see Figures 8.5; Figure 8.6), such as Australia and New Zealand or Iceland and North Europe, encompass population groups that are exposed and vulnerable to climate hazards, such as sea level rise or droughts but, within these regions’ context, conditions exist that allow the negative impacts and losses to be buffered (also for most vulnerable groups). These regions have higher financial and institutional capacities to support people at risk and planned adaptation at a different magnitude within their region, for example, as seen in compensation payments for drought exposed farmers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hochrainer-Stigler--2017">Hochrainer-Stigler and Hanger-Kopp, 2017</a>; Australian-Government, 2021) or flood affected households in Germany in 2021. Also, the percentage of households insured against climate-influenced hazards, such as floods or storms, is significantly higher in these regions (North America, Western Europe) compared to regions such as Western Africa or Micronesia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Welle--2015">Welle and Birkmann, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Feldmeyer--2021">Feldmeyer et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2022">Birkmann et al., 2022</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">While climate change differentially impacts people in vulnerable situations within countries, including the poor, children, women, marginalised Indigenous or other ethnic minority people (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rhiney--2016">Rhiney et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#M%C3%A9ndez--2020">Méndez et al., 2020</a>), the global assessment results underscore that, in most vulnerable regions and countries, very limited resources and structures exist to support these groups when droughts, floods or storms occur and place an additional burden on these groups.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The assessments of human vulnerability also point towards important adaptation options that are not visible if one focuses on climatic hazards or temperature changes alone (Figure 8.9; <a class="reference-link" href="#D%C3%BCckers--2015">Dückers et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cutter--2016">Cutter et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2021a">Birkmann et al., 2021a</a>). Fundamental for vulnerability reduction and adaptation are social insurances and infrastructure programmes, as well as legislation that improves the access of poor and marginalised groups to basic infrastructure services and security. For example, the ‘free basic service programme’ of the national government of South Africa (GovSA, 2021) is one example where a national government (Government of South Africa) has committed itself to providing a basic amount of free water, electricity and sanitation to low-income households, particularly indigent people, such as those living in informal settlements or remote rural areas. Coupled with incentives, for example in terms of a higher use of renewable energy (e.g., solar home systems in rural areas) (see GovSA, 2021), these investments can support vulnerability reduction and mitigation of GHG emissions. However, the programme design and implementation has also been criticised (see <a class="reference-link" href="#Nel--2005">Nel and Rogerson, 2005</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Muller--2008">Muller, 2008</a>), as is witnessed by ongoing service delivery protests (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mutyambizi--2020">Mutyambizi et al., 2020</a>). This example shows that current national programmes can—even if they are not classified as adaptation measures—provide important entry points to reduce human vulnerability to climate change.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The relevance of human vulnerability has also been confirmed by recent assessments. The assessment of vulnerability studies and mortality data found that the average mortality <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang><span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="ch08.html#footnote-001">5</a> </span></span> from floods, storms and droughts is 15 times higher in regions and countries ranked as very highly vulnerable (e.g., Afghanistan, Haiti, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia) compared to regions and countries with very low vulnerability (e.g., Canada, Italy, Sweden, UK) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2022">Birkmann et al., 2022</a>). These patterns are confirmed by other studies (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#CRED%20and%20UNDRR--2015">CRED and UNDRR, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#CRED%20and%20UNDRR--2016">CRED and UNDRR, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#CRED%20and%20UNDRR--2020b">CRED and UNDRR, 2020b</a>) that examined disaster mortality per hazard event in low and lower middle income countries compared to high income countries and therewith also point towards major differences between countries with high and low vulnerability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pelling--2004">Pelling et al., 2004</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#CRED%20and%20UNDRR--2015">CRED and UNDRR, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#CRED%20and%20UNDRR--2016">CRED and UNDRR, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#CRED%20and%20UNDRR--2020b">CRED and UNDRR, 2020b</a>). Even if one takes solely ‘highly vulnerable countries’ such as India, Pakistan and the Philippines (and not ‘very highly’ vulnerable countries), mortality is still nine times higher compared to very low vulnerability countries. Similarly, studies further revealed that average number of adversely affected people per hazard event (e.g., loss of the house) is 11 times higher in regions and countries categorised as having very high vulnerability compared to very low vulnerability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2022">Birkmann et al., 2022</a>). In addition to floods, droughts and storms, published EM-DAT data for wildfires and heat stress, confirmed higher suffering (higher average mortality) in more vulnerable regions compared to less vulnerable regions, particularly when excluding extreme outliers (<a class="reference-link" href="#CRED--2020">CRED, 2020</a>). These findings point towards the fact that in regions identified as highly vulnerable in the assessments even moderate future climate change and future climate hazards are likely to push people further into poverty and lead to significant destabilisation processes in terms of livelihoods security (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wallemacq--2018">Wallemacq and House, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2022">Birkmann et al., 2022</a>).</p><div class="h4-container" id="8.3.2.1.1"><h4 class="Headings_H4" lang="de-DE">8.3.2.1.1 Historic roots of vulnerability in regions classified as highly vulnerable <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h4><div class="h4-siblings" id="h4-1-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">While increasing attention is given to issues of human vulnerability, less attention has been given to the historical conditions that foster systemic vulnerability of societies.

An analysis that measured the vulnerability of countries according to the INFORM Risk Index and the WorldRiskIndex vulnerability index components, differentiating vulnerability values into seven vulnerability classes found that nearly twice as many people are living in most vulnerable countries compared to the number living in less vulnerable countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2021a">Birkmann et al., 2021a</a>). Another study that uses the same data and differentiates vulnerability into five classes (also considering the lack of coping capacity within the INFORM index, see (<a class="reference-link" href="#Marin-Ferrer--2017">Marin-Ferrer et al., 2017</a>)) concludes that about 3.3 billion people are living in countries classified as highly vulnerable, while approximately 1.8 billion people live in countries with low vulnerability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2022">Birkmann et al., 2022</a>). Additional assessments based on the classification of income groups of countries reveal that approximately 3.6 billion people live in low and lower middle-income countries, which are most vulnerable and disproportionally bear the human costs of disasters due to extreme weather events and hazards (World Bank, 2019b; <a class="reference-link" href="#CRED%20and%20UNDRR--2020b">CRED and UNDRR, 2020b</a>; EC-DRMKC, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#UN-DESA--2020a">UN-DESA, 2020a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UN-DESA--2021">UN-DESA, 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2022">Birkmann et al., 2022</a>).

Newer research points towards the fact that various phenomena of vulnerability, particularly in highly vulnerable regions, spill over national borders and emerge in rather regional clusters, such as forced migration and poverty in West and Central Africa, as well as conflicts in the Near East and Asia (<a class="reference-link" href="#IDMC--2020">IDMC, 2020</a>). This means that regional and transboundary challenges contribute to the formation of systemic human vulnerability, for example, forced migration that is occurring within countries, but also across international borders that is also influenced by climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kaczan--2020">Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020</a>). In summary, these findings point towards the need for more transboundary approaches in vulnerability and risk reduction, adaptation and development.

This includes, for example, cooperation between national-level institutions, but also transboundary networks of cities or communities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tilleard--2016">Tilleard and Ford, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Benzie--2019">Benzie and Persson, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2021a">Birkmann et al., 2021a</a>). The transnational nature of climate change impacts means that addressing them requires concerted efforts among nations (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014b">IPCC, 2014b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dzebo--2019">Dzebo, 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In addition, national response strategies for specific transboundary climate-influenced hazards, such as river flooding, droughts or coastal flooding can also significantly influence neighbouring countries and can affect exposure and vulnerability of the respective country (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nadin--2018">Nadin and Roberts, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Booth--2020">Booth et al., 2020</a>). Likewise, climate change may affect transboundary resources (e.g., underground water reserves) and transboundary ecosystems (e.g., in terms of the migration of species) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vij--2017">Vij et al., 2017</a>) and thereby further reduce the capacity of vulnerable groups to cope and adapt. In addition, recent research indicates that social inequities are also coupled with access to and quality of environmental resources in urban environments—meaning social and environmental justices are interconnected (see <a class="reference-link" href="#Schell--2020">Schell et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Individual adaptation projects to specific climate hazards in regions classified as highly vulnerable are needed. However, recent studies underscore that deeper development challenges need to be addressed in order to make progress towards adaptation and vulnerability reduction and to avoid maladaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eriksen--2021">Eriksen et al., 2021</a>). Adaptation and development projects, such as the construction of a dam as a response to water shortages in one country can significantly influence the exposure to water shortages and the response capacities of another country downstream. Often, transboundary challenges are a result of policy and resource management choices or uncertainty, and addressing them requires a greater engagement between governing bodies, which may also guide more suitable responses in the context of climate change adaptation and vulnerability reduction (<a class="reference-link" href="#Earle--2015">Earle et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tilleard--2016">Tilleard and Ford, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McLeman--2018">McLeman, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2021a">Birkmann et al., 2021a</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Most of those countries and regional clusters identified as highly vulnerable have contributed little to the overall amount of GHG emissions and therefore support for (transboundary) adaptation from the international community is required in these places and for those living under these conditions in order to support and achieve climate justice.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="8.3.2.3"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">8.3.2.3 The Effect of Higher Levels of Global Warming for Most Vulnerable Regions and Specific Livelihoods <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-12-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Evidence exists that threats to land-based livelihoods and risks of undernutrition increase significantly with higher levels of global warming (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hoegh-Guldberg--2019a">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019a</a>). With global warming of 1.5°C or less, impacts of climate change on livelihoods are still significant, for example, for West Africa and the Sahel there will be an estimated reduction of the area suitable for maize production of about 40%. The consequences of global warming of up to 3°C would mean a high risk of undernutrition for entire regions (see <a class="reference-link" href="#Hoegh-Guldberg--2019a">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019a</a>) that are already classified as most vulnerable (see Figure 8.6). That means the consequences of significant warming are a particular challenge for regional hotspots of vulnerability. Small changes in crop productivity, already observed due to increasing droughts, floods or changes in rainfall patterns, could lead to severe health risks and undernutrition. This is because of existing precarious living conditions and the limited capacities that people and institutions have to build and enhance coping and adaptive capacities at the level of individual households, communities and state institutions (see <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2018">UNEP, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2021a">Birkmann et al., 2021a</a>). The risk of loss of life, displacement and adverse health consequences due to climate change in these most vulnerable regions (such as Micronesia, South Asia, West Africa—see Figures 8.5; 8.6) is higher compared to regions classified as having medium or low vulnerability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2022">Birkmann et al., 2022</a>). Nevertheless, other regions and countries classified as less vulnerable, for example in Asia, are experiencing disasters and have a relative high share of the observed global fatalities or losses, when considering non-climatic natural hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#CRED%20and%20UNDRR--2020a">CRED and UNDRR, 2020a</a>; see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Hotspots and Spatial Patterns of Multidimensional Vulnerability" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.3.2.1">Section 8.3.2.1</a>). In addition, changing climatic hazard and exposure patterns have to be considered. However, the agreement of major global index systems on exposure is significantly lower compared to vulnerability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Garschagen--2021">Garschagen et al., 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Moreover, the assessment reveals that in most vulnerable regions a double burden of existing destabilised livelihood conditions and additional climatic hazards is already visible and largely influences societal impacts of climate change. For example, flooding along the White Nile in Uganda and South Sudan hit vulnerable communities that were displaced due to conflicts and were thus uprooted again by flooding (<a class="reference-link" href="#IDMC--2020">IDMC, 2020</a>). Societal impacts and future risks of climate change to societies need to incorporate information about vulnerability and exposure—including capacities of people to cope and adapt (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wisner--2016">Wisner, 2016</a>; Cardona et al., 2020). There is increasing evidence that individual and societal capacities to cope and adapt also depend on how governmental and national institutions can support people at risk (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Resilient Development for the Poor and Pro-poor Adaptation Finance: Ensuring Climate Justice and Sustainable Development" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.6">Section 8.6</a>). For example, climate information services depend on a functioning weather service. Likewise, social safety nets as an adaptation strategy require financial resources, which are often absent for most people in highly vulnerable regions. In addition, examples of national programmes that target most vulnerable groups, such as the free basic service programme in South Africa, show that next to the adaptation to individual hazards, strategies exist that aim to reduce systemic human vulnerability (see GovSA, 2021).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">At the same time, there is scientific evidence that more intense and frequent climate-influenced hazards (e.g., storms, flooding, droughts, heat stress) can undermine decade-long poverty reduction efforts, particularly in most vulnerable regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mysiak--2016">Mysiak et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Formetta--2019">Formetta and Feyen, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Laborde--2020b">Laborde et al., 2020b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lakner--2020">Lakner et al., 2020</a>). There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span> that, with global warming of about 3°C, such undermining of poverty reduction efforts will intensify and more regions will face development setbacks due to the spatial and temporal expansion of climate hazards, including the further erosion of capital that enables people to develop adaptive capacities (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Options and Enabling Environments for Adaptation with a Particular Focus on the Poor, Different Livelihood Capitals and Vulnerable Groups" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.5">Section 8.5</a>). Such trends can further exacerbate poverty traps (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Detection and Attribution of Observed Impacts and Responses" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.2">Section 8.2.2</a>). According to a World Bank report, between 32 and 132 million people could fall into extreme poverty by 2030 due to the impacts of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jafino--2020">Jafino et al., 2020</a>). Models estimate that at 3°C warming and under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 1, there would be an additional 245 million people exposed to poverty. Under SSP2 this number would increase to 904 million additional people exposed to poverty (SSP2) and under SSP3 (with significant challenges for equity) about 1918 million additional people could be exposed to poverty in the year 2050 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Byers--2018">Byers et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Overall, the assessments above underscore that adaptation and risk reduction require not only information about changing climatic conditions, but also assessments that capture the development contexts and structural inequality that determine and influence human vulnerability. Strategies that reduce poverty and inequality and that improve the access of people to basic services need to become a higher priority in adaptation and development planning in order to avoid more than 3 billion people currently and even more in the future being exposed to severe adverse consequences of climate change.

Traditional pastoralist systems are also greatly impacted by cumulative dual challenges of encroachment of other land users and by climate change. Traditional Sami reindeer herding strategies are still practiced, but the rapidly changing environmental circumstances are forcing herders into uncharted territories where traditional strategies and the transmission of knowledge between generations may be of limited use.

Throughout the Caribbean, evidence indicates that there will be an overall reduction in the area of land suitable for crop cultivation, as the region’s climate gets progressively warmer and as rainfall becomes more variable (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rhiney--2016">Rhiney et al., 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The multiple shocks of extreme events reduce crop yields, destroy homes, and lead to loss of infrastructure and displacement (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). These are experienced in South and North America. For example, in Peru, glacial outbursts have led to loss of livelihoods (<a class="reference-link" href="#Drenkhan--2019">Drenkhan et al., 2019</a>). People use a range of coping and adaptation strategies to deal with hazards where they live, such as shifting livelihood activities, inputs or production areas. However, traditional techniques are increasingly failing due to changing weather patterns. Across Peru, findings demonstrate that people use temporary and permanent migration among their many coping and adaptation strategies. Hazards related to water excess have been the key force in destroying homes and driving displacement in Peru. In contrast, studies demonstrate that water scarcity also threatens livelihoods and thereby influences migration in Peru. While non-climatic reasons for moving dominate migrants’ motivations in many areas of Peru, water-related climatic drivers of migration are becoming increasingly relevant (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wrathall--2014">Wrathall et al., 2014</a>). Peru’s smallholder farmers and urban poor are not responsible for the climate crisis, yet their lives and cultural heritage are being increasingly jeopardised by its effects, making improvements in governance an imperative for Peru (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bergmann--2021">Bergmann et al., 2021</a>). Another area of significance is coffee production in Brazil, where the majority of Brazilian coffee farms are operated by smallholders, producers with relatively small properties, who are mostly reliant on family labour (<a class="reference-link" href="#Koh--2020">Koh et al., 2020</a>). In the USA (e.g., New Orleans and Puerto Rico), people have lost livelihoods due to displaced households and destroyed homes, leading to loss of income, as well as loss of social networks and family networks and loss of cultural heritage. For example, impacts of Hurricane Katrina have led to people being displaced from their employment, many evacuees had to relocate to new areas, which disrupted their social networks and placed them in unfamiliar labour markets, resulting in mental health challenges (<a class="reference-link" href="#Palinkas--2020">Palinkas, 2020</a>). There has also been a ‘climate gentrification’ in parts of New Orleans (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aune--2020">Aune et al., 2020</a>).

Adaptation measures need to better incorporate actions to tackle the burgeoning negative social, psychological and well-being impacts of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barnett--2016">Barnett et al., 2016</a>; Box 8.5). At present, losses from climate change are potentially growing faster than adaptation measures across the globe. It is still uncertain how economic and non-economic losses trigger successful or viable new climate-related livelihood transitions for the poor and people or groups in vulnerable situations in the future (see Sections 8.4.4; 8.4.5). In all likelihoods, economic losses from climate hazards (e.g., drought) will be compounded by many factors including COVID-19 and other vulnerability drivers. For instance, globally, small-scale coffee producers have been destabilised by COVID-19, but also because of a history of recurrent (climate) shocks and structural inequalities, and may have to shift into alternative livelihoods (<a class="reference-link" href="#Guido--2020">Guido et al., 2020</a>).

This trend poses real challenges to equity and sustainability.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In summary, this section has moved beyond the IPCC WGII AR5 in laying out structural elements of vulnerability and climate-related vulnerability hotspots globally, such as poverty, lack of access to basic services, gender inequality and undernourishment. The assessment provides new quantitative evidence about the global spatial distribution of systemic human vulnerability and therewith underscores that various hotspots of countries classified as having very high or high vulnerability emerge in regional clusters. In addition, the number of people living in very highly and highly vulnerable country contexts is significantly higher in some assessments, with even twice as many as the number of people living in countries classified as having low and very low vulnerability. The evidence suggests that statistically relevant differences in fatalities per hazard event are not just a product of the hazard event, but also strongly linked with the level of vulnerability of the region or community exposed. The assessment of non-economic losses has also received little attention in past IPCC Assessment Reports, therefore this section has provided new insights on how (next to measurable economic losses) non-economic losses and intangible losses emerge. These non-economic losses represent an important dimension of societal impacts of climate change that has not sufficiently captured so far within standard damage or post-disaster assessments. Finally, the section provides evidence about the existing adaptation gap in terms of differential vulnerabilities and various non-economic losses already experienced.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-8.5"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 8.5 | Western Cape Region in South Africa: drought challenges to equity and sustainability</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-24-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H2" lang="en-GB">Nature of the drought</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Between 2015 and 2017, the Western Cape region experienced an unprecedented three consecutive years of below average rainfall, leading to acute water shortages, most prominently in the city of Cape Town (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sousa--2018">Sousa et al., 2018</a>).

(2016)</a> conclude that worldwide the number of people exposed to extreme droughts will increase under both the RCP4.5 and the RCP8.5 particularly at the end of the century. The authors assess that under RCP4.5 the average monthly global population exposed to drought will increase between the periods 2008–2017 and 2081–2100 from a mean of 80 million to 212 million, and under RCP8.5 from about 90 million to approximately 472 million people. The research findings underscore that there is a high probability that exposure to extreme droughts will increase, particularly in regions and countries already classified as highly vulnerable (e.g., Nigeria, Sudan, etc.) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smirnov--2016">Smirnov et al., 2016</a>). Extreme droughts are expected to further erode coping and adaptive capacities of those already characterised by high levels of vulnerability (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Assessments of Risk and Vulnerability" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.3.1">Section 8.3.1</a>). Building adaptive capacities for the most vulnerable groups in the future in these areas will be a challenge, since high levels of livelihood insecurity are coupled with high levels of structural vulnerability at national and regional scale (poverty, state fragility, etc.) making planned adaptation support very complex and difficult. Therefore, increasing adaptation gaps at different scales are anticipated in the future.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Increasing population exposure (e.g., due to urbanisation of coastal zones, etc.), coupled with higher frequencies and intensities of specific climate hazards are <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> in connection with the existing adaptation gap (e.g., high levels of vulnerability) to compromise development and human security. Recent studies, such as that by Harrington (2018), conclude that the actual exposure and the physical individual recognition of some climate hazards, will be higher in low-income countries. The study of Harrington (2018) underscores that changes in extreme heat, for example, will be felt by the average citizen of a low-income country after 1.5°C of global warming and will not be felt by about 40% of people living in high-income nations until well after double the amount of global warming is reached (3°C increase). In this context, even if a city or place is exposed to heat stress, people experience it quite differently due to different levels of vulnerability and adaptive capacities, such as the ability to afford air conditioning (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barreca--2016">Barreca et al., 2016</a>). That means well-off populations are better insulated from effects of global warming than poorer or more vulnerable groups, even if they are geographically living in the same exposure zone. These findings underscore that issues of climate justice need to be considered within the problem definition when designing adaptation strategies, and not solely at the end. Impacts of future climate hazards (heat stress, flooding, etc.) differ not only due to changes in frequency and intensity of the hazard itself, but also significantly in terms of the opportunities people have to respond and prepare for these hazards and climatic changes at present and in the future. However, extreme heat stress has also caused significant fatalities in countries classified as having low vulnerability, such as seen within the heat wave in Europe in 2003.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="8.4.3"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">8.4.3 The Influence of Climate Change Responses on Projected Development Pathways <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-11-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Responses to climate change can have dual effects on development pathways. On the one hand, mitigation and adaptation processes can create significant development opportunities. The potential of mitigation policies for job creation, in particular, has been highlighted (<a class="reference-link" href="#Healy--2017">Healy and Barry, 2017</a>). However, responses to climate change can also have detrimental effects on future development: mitigation policies, such as the building of hydro-electrical dams or the culture of biofuels can lead to communities’ dislocation and populations’ resettlement, particularly of disadvantaged groups within a society (<a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Sherbinin--2011">de Sherbinin et al., 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Eriksen--2021">Eriksen et al., 2021</a>). Adaptation policies can also hinder some development processes: for example, the promotion of migration as an adaptation strategy can lead to communities being deprived of their workforce and resenting the departure of some of their members (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gemenne--2017">Gemenne and Blocher, 2017</a>), even though this may offer new livelihood opportunities. However, the migration consequences in the context of climate change are often more nuanced and different trade-offs and benefits occur (see <a class="reference-link" href="#Porst--2020">Porst and Sakdapolrak, 2020</a>). For example, remittances support family members but, at the same time, can also create imbalances in local markets (<a class="reference-link" href="#Melde--2017">Melde et al., 2017</a>).

Evidence shows that major destabilising social transformations (e.g., forced migration) can occur in response to limited climate change impacts, even while major climate change impacts can be mitigated through the resilience of social, political and economic systems, and thus yield only minor social impacts.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In the context of climate change, ‘tipping points’ have been identified as critical thresholds at which a tiny perturbation can qualitatively alter the state or development of a system (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lenton--2008">Lenton et al., 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lenton--2019">Lenton et al., 2019</a>). The concept of tipping points is usually associated with large-scale components of the climate system that could be pushed past an irretrievable threshold as a result of human-induced climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lenton--2008">Lenton et al., 2008</a>), such as the deterioration of Antarctic ice sheets (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pattyn--2020">Pattyn and Morlighem, 2020</a>). Social tipping points refer to similar mechanisms of destabilisation resulting from impacts of climate change on human societies at multiple scales and the societal context conditions in which these impacts occur. They are reached when climate change impacts force destabilising social transformations from one state to another (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lenton--2019">Lenton et al., 2019</a>): from sporadic losses due to climate change to chronic losses and impoverishment, from peace to violence, from a democracy to an authoritarian regime, from adequate food provisioning to famine, or into forced migration. For example, small variations in the rainfall or temperature can jeopardise livelihoods that are dependent upon subsistence agriculture, which can lead to migration or tensions around resources (see Figure 8.11). Social tipping points can also occur when intangible elements that ensure the survival of individuals and communities are eroded or removed. This is the case, for example, when the social fabric of a community falls apart. The Millennium drought in Australia led to higher rates of male suicide, especially among farmers, and droughts in Ghana led to similar outcome when people were forced to drink from the same water source as their animals, which they perceived as robbing them off their human dignity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bryant--2015">Bryant and Garnham, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tschakert--2019">Tschakert et al., 2019</a>).</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer036"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-12" id="figure-8-011" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_8_011.png"></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 8.11 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>A social tipping point is reached when climate impacts push a society towards a state of instability. </span>Those climate impacts are typically aggravated by economic, social and political stressors that reduce adaptive capacity and overwhelm its resilience.

In other contexts, the expectation of a climate impact can trigger social or political shifts: for example, the expectation of lower snow cover levers can reduce or stop investments in ski resorts.

Therefore, social tipping points should not be confused with the carrying capacity of a community.

The carrying capacity of a community can evolve over time, but remains a static concept, unlike social tipping points. Social tipping points have also been applied to adaptation, through the concept of adaptation tipping points, which indicate how much pressure a socio-environmental system is able to absorb (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ahmed--2018">Ahmed et al., 2018</a>).

While livelihoods operate in a dynamic context characterised by multiple interacting structures and processes, climate change can act as a risk multiplier. When current livelihood activities become untenable as a result of both long trends and short-term shocks and climate hazards (e.g., droughts, floods), shifting livelihoods is a common response and, in many cases, can be unavoidable due to the negative consequences of these climate hazards on specific livelihood capitals (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Options and Enabling Environments for Adaptation with a Particular Focus on the Poor, Different Livelihood Capitals and Vulnerable Groups" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.5">Section 8.5</a>). Such shifts can involve a change in livelihood activities (e.g., continuing in agriculture but growing different kinds of crops), or a change to broader livelihood strategies (e.g., diversifying into handicrafts or paid employment, specialising in one particular activity, or migrating, seasonally or permanently, in search of other livelihood opportunities) or even an entire change of the livelihood activity, for example, abandoning agriculture altogether (<a class="reference-link" href="#McLeman--2006">McLeman and Smit, 2006</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Black--2011">Black et al., 2011</a>).

For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Hirons--2014">Hirons (2014)</a> assesses artisanal and small-scale mining as an emerging livelihood opportunity in Ghana. Evidence challenges the popular assertion around the idea of wealth seeking for short-term profit and reveals an alternative scenario whereby artisanal and small-scale mining can be a poverty-driven activity, particularly in areas in which agricultural employment has not delivered sufficient income or where crops are highly exposed and sensitive to climate change impacts. Income from new livelihood activities can support recovery following specific events (major flooding or drought) linked to climate hazards and climate change. Livelihood shifts therefore take place in a highly dynamic and heterogeneous context. Another example comes from the Small Lake Chad, Republic of Chad studied by (<a class="reference-link" href="#Okpara--2016a">Okpara et al., 2016a</a>). Fluctuating water levels linked to seasonal flood pulses and droughts were shown to link closely to livelihood dynamics. Lake drying led to new adaptive behaviours based on seasonality (e.g., migration of herders to different areas of the lake shore to access water resources, in line with more predictable seasonal changes), as well as linking to opportunism supported by climate change impacts. For example, during times of lake flooding, new opportunities for fishing opened for people that were otherwise operating primarily as pastoral or agricultural households. However, these kinds of livelihood shifts remain largely reactive and can bring negative as well as positive impacts. In the Lake Chad case, it resulted in social clashes between different groups, while in other examples from Tanzania, livelihood shifts towards extensification of farming led to deforestation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Suckall--2014">Suckall et al., 2014</a>), which could constitute a maladaptive shift. Such findings have important implications for the types of government and institutional support that can enable livelihood shifts and highlight the need to consider trade-offs for climate change mitigation, as well as with other adaptation options (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Resilient Development for the Poor and Pro-poor Adaptation Finance: Ensuring Climate Justice and Sustainable Development" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.6">Section 8.6</a>).</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="8.4.5.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">8.4.5.2 Future risks, vulnerabilities, differentiated inequalities and livelihood shifts <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-22-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Overall, there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span> that future climate change impacts are going to worsen poverty and exacerbate inequalities within and between nations, with projections that by 2030 these will increase significantly (<a class="reference-link" href="#Olsson--2014">Olsson et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hallegatte--2017">Hallegatte and Rozenberg, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al., 2018</a>).

Table 8.4 provides an overview of what is known in the literature assessed about future risks, inequalities and particularly future vulnerabilities, including potential challenges for climate justice and adaptation barriers. For example, barriers for gender, ethnicity and class have been addressed for a long time yet need substantive intervention.

There are also inequalities associated with opportunities to adapt to risks that are unevenly distributed among global regions, with richer and more equal societies in the Global North presenting superior capacities than Global South communities, sectors, ecological systems and species, where the most detrimental climate change impacts are experienced (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hoegh-Guldberg--2018">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al., 2018</a>). The climate-sensitive livelihoods of poor and vulnerable communities in the Global South, and the unprecedented ecosystems losses are examples of multiple limits of adaptation that emerge simultaneously and are also linked to the differential access to assets and resources, such as physical (propriety, income), social (health, age, education) cultural (shared community values and norms, ethnicity), ecological (linked to land use change and productivity) and institutional (market, policies and governance) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hoegh-Guldberg--2019a">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Olsson--2019">Olsson et al., 2019</a>).

However, it is also important to note that limits are associated with development, technology and cultural norms and values that can change over time to enhance or reduce the capacity of systems to avoid limits (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adger--2014">Adger et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al., 2018</a>).

For soft limits, however, adaptation options could become available in the future through changing attitudes or values or as a result of innovation or other resources becoming available to most vulnerable and poor actors, households and countries. However, when compounded with lack of finance, and high costs associated with disasters, poverty and environmental degradation, soft limits could become hard ones in the future (see Figure 8.5; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gracia--2018">Gracia et al., 2018</a>). </span></p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Table 8.6, built from SR1.5°C (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al., 2018</a>), illustrates how ecological thresholds and socioeconomic determinants are linked to soft and hard adaptation limits and what the potential and magnitude of livelihoods risks will be in the future. For instance, in the SR1.5°C (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018b">IPCC, 2018b</a>) and Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>), hard limits are expected with global warming beyond 1.5°C associated with the loss of coral reefs, that will lead to substantial loss of income and livelihoods for coastal communities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mechler--2019b">Mechler et al., 2019b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2019">Oppenheimer et al., 2019</a>). The loss of coral reefs around the remote islands of Boigu in Australia is affecting low-lying communities facing financial, institutional (<a class="reference-link" href="#Evans--2016">Evans et al., 2016</a>) and cultural place-based attachment adaptation limits (<a class="reference-link" href="#McNamara--2017">McNamara et al., 2017</a>). Another hard limit to adaptation with implications for income, and culture- and place-based livelihoods is related to the sensitivity of fish to global temperature increase, with losses in fish reproduction expected to be 10% (SSP1–1.9) to about 60% (SSP5–8.5), potentially cascading into severe risks for fisheries livelihoods (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dahlke--2020">Dahlke et al., 2020</a>). In West African fisheries, the loss of coastal ecosystems and productivity are estimated to require 5–10% of countries’ GDP in adaptation costs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zougmor%C3%A9--2016">Zougmoré et al., 2016</a>), incurring financial limits in poor countries to avoid socioeconomic risks. The SROCC (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>) showed that scientific knowledge limitations can constrain management of coastlines, mainly in the context of lack of data, affecting most of the vulnerable and poor communities in the Global South (<a class="reference-link" href="#Perkins--2015">Perkins et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sutton-Grier--2015">Sutton-Grier et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wigand--2017">Wigand et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roma%C3%B1ach--2018">Romañach et al., 2018</a>).

In this context, looking at this case study through the lenses of poverty, inequality and the SDGs, it addresses the compound effect of climate and land use change in the Amazon forest fires and its cascading impacts and risks on the social domain in the region.

The fire outbreaks intensified substantially to the point that, in August 2019, there were approximately 3500 fires in 148 Indigenous territories (DETER and INPE, 2019; ISA, 2019). Although most of the burning in the Legal Amazon in Brazil occurred on private land of medium and larger sizes (about 67%), around 33% was observed within Indigenous territories and protected areas called conservation units (UCs) (DETER and INPE, 2019; ISA, 2019). In 2019, 40% of the deforestation occurred in public forests, which encompasses undesignated forest lands, Indigenous territories and UCs. This deforestation came accompanied by fires: 18% of the 2019 fires occurred on undesignated lands, 7% on Indigenous territories and 6% on UCs, where many traditional populations live (<a class="reference-link" href="#Alencar--2020">Alencar et al., 2020</a>). During 2019, 46% of the deforestation and 52% of the fires occurred on private rural properties and settlements, respectively, where legal accountability for these crimes is possible.

At the same time, developing suitable responses to hazards for communities and users of climate services is important in ensuring the success of adaptation measures.

There is increasing evidence on the adaptation options that enhance the ability of different socio-ecological systems to become resilient in the long term in ways that do not exacerbate poverty and inequality, and on which adaptations may have little or no impact, or even adverse effects (maladaptation). Analysis of climate hazards can provide an indication of required adaptation strategies, however, most important is the focus on exposure and vulnerability. The novelty of the AR6 is the assessment of existing response capacities to cope and adapt to climate changes and associated hazards. There is increasing knowledge about the differential adaptation options within and across social groups and the influence of (enabling) conditions that enhance or limit these options.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">From the analysis in the IPCC AR5, there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span> that engineered and technological adaptation options are still the most common adaptation responses. However, there is increased recognition of the value of ecosystem-based, institutional and social measures, including the provision of climate-linked safety nets for those who are most vulnerable (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>). Climate adaptation measures are increasingly integrated within wider policy, development strategies and spatial planning frameworks. Such integration streamlines the adaptation planning and decision-making process and embeds climate-sensitive thinking in existing and new institutions and organisations across scales and levels.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In past decades, a number of categories of adaptation options have been identified and are discussed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Options and Enabling Environments for Adaptation with a Particular Focus on the Poor, Different Livelihood Capitals and Vulnerable Groups" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.5">Section 8.5</a>. Adaptation options are categorised in various ways, such as in terms of grey and green adaptation or hard and soft measures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Depietri--2013">Depietri et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chambwera--2014">Chambwera et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Grimm--2015">Grimm et al., 2015</a>). Grey measures refer, for example, to technological and engineering solutions to improve adaptation of infrastructures or to protect a specific land use or city from adverse consequences of climate hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2018">OECD, 2018</a>). Accordingly, ecosystem-based approaches, including natural infrastructure, can provide an effective complement or substitute for traditional built (or ‘grey’) infrastructure. For example, watershed restoration can protect sources of drinking water and reduce the need for subsequent treatment. Green measures often encompass ecosystem-based (or nature-based) approaches. These make use of the multiple services provided by ecosystems to improve resilience and adaptive capacity or to reduce risk. Soft adaptation measures include policy, legal, social, management and financial measures that can alter human behaviour and support adaptive governance, contributing to improved adaptation capacity, increased awareness, and change in values and actions on climate change issues.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Adaptation actions frequently include deliberate, coordinated, proactive policy decisions based on the awareness that conditions have changed or will change and that action is required to avert impacts or return to, maintain or achieve a desired state (<a class="reference-link" href="#Carter--1994">Carter et al., 1994</a>). Governance provides an important contextual framing, particularly in contexts where it is weak or contested (e.g., some of the Sahel zone). In these cases, it can mean that adaptation options stem largely from the local level. Adaptation processes can be categorised as individual, collective, proactive, reactive, autonomous, coordinated or natural (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chambwera--2014">Chambwera et al., 2014</a>). Apart from governments, other actors, organisations and institutions (including non-state agencies and private industry actors) also play an important part in adaptation processes, and consequently the discussion of enabling environments for sustainable or successful adaptation has to consider these different scales and actors. For example, while autonomous adaptations are mainly undertaken by private actors, triggered by climate change-induced market or welfare changes, planned adaptations can be carried out by both private and public actors. Natural adaptations appear within ecosystems as a reaction to climate change, as well as other factors, and incorporate innumerable possible actions that are context specific, ranging from managerial approaches to technological innovations and ecosystem-based approaches (<a class="reference-link" href="#Huq--2004">Huq et al., 2004</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Sanchez--2017">Sanchez et al. (2017)</a> draws attention to preconceived ideas about some adaptation measures that are either considered good or bad without proper evaluation. It is argued that the association ‘hard-bad’ and ‘soft-good’ is not necessarily true; the impacts of adaptation can only be established through a case-by-case assessment. The decision to select a more or less intensive adaptation measure should integrate all approaches, social, environmental, technical and economic, in a multi-criteria analysis. This analysis should value, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>inter alia</span>, social and environmental sensitivity, benefits and drawbacks or trade-offs with climate, including all the adaptation options, among them the ‘no action’ alternative.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Adaptation frequently responds to an observed or anticipated ‘trigger’ for response, such as the looming loss of land to sea level rise (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barnett--2014">Barnett et al., 2014</a>). Identifying adaptation needs stemming from climate risks and vulnerabilities provides a foundation for selecting a sequence of adaptation options that connect through time, a long-term adaptation pathway (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wise--2014">Wise et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Turnheim--2015">Turnheim et al., 2015</a>). National, sectoral or local adaptation plans are <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> to include a number of measures that are implemented jointly from across various categories, including structural, institutional and social options. While structural or physical adaptation encompasses measures for the engineered built environment it also can encompass nature-based solutions, which include ecosystem-based protection measures, for example to buffer risks and hazard exposure to extreme weather events. The category of ‘soft’ adaptation measures—changes in societal values or practices—is often linked to issues of education, information and behavioural changes to support communities within specific adaptation processes to climate change and climate hazards. Institutional adaptation deals with adaptation actions and measures introduced through new legal frameworks, laws and regulations for new institutions or policies for risk reduction and adaptation. This category can also encompass the development of new organisations that have a mandate to support adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Noble--2014">Noble et al., 2014</a>). The appropriateness and accessibility of adaptation options under these categories for supporting the poor and most vulnerable groups differs. In many cases large-scale structural measures are not affordable for many poor communities. Despite this important potential of Indigenous knowledge for disaster risk reduction of communities, it is often shunned by practitioners (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dube--2018">Dube and Munsaka, 2018</a>). It is further argued by practitioners that Indigenous knowledge lacks documentation, it is not found in all generational classes, it is contextualised to particular communities and the knowledge cannot be scientifically validated. However, there is also evidence that both local communities and disaster risk reduction practitioners can benefit from the Indigenous knowledge of communities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dube--2018">Dube and Munsaka, 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In practice, adaptation refers to initiatives such as a policy, plan, project or decision that are designed to change and/or respond to something in the context of existing risks and hazards.

It is paramount that approaches to selecting adaptation options continue to emphasise incremental change to reduce impacts while achieving co-benefits. There is increasing evidence that transformative changes may be necessary in order to prepare for climate change impacts and adaptation options in the context of climate hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Noble--2014">Noble et al., 2014</a>). Transformation for some actors at some levels may equate with incremental change and transitions for other actors and scales. While attention to flexibility and safety margins is becoming more common in selecting adaptation options, many see the need for more urgent and transformative changes in our perception and paradigms about the nature of climate change, adaptation and their relationship to other natural and human systems.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In this context, there are many potential adaptation options available for a marginal change of existing agricultural and other livelihood systems, often variations of existing climate risk management. According to <a class="reference-link" href="#Howden--2007">Howden et al. (2007)</a>, implementation of these options is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> to have substantial benefits under moderate climate change for some existing cropping systems. Apparently, there are limits to their effectiveness under more severe climate changes. Hence, more systemic changes in resource allocation need to be considered, such as targeted diversification of production systems and livelihoods. <a class="reference-link" href="#Howden--2007">Howden et al. (2007)</a> further argue that achieving increased adaptation action will necessitate integration of climate change-related issues with other risk factors, which implies integrating non-climatic factors, such as climate variability and market risk, and with other policy domains, such as sustainable development. An increasing number of research programmes seek to support adaptation to climate change through the engagement of large-scale transdisciplinary networks that span countries and continents (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cundill--2019">Cundill et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Based on analysis of different adaptation options, there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span> that the many barriers to effective adaptation will require a comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a range of geographical scales and multiple actors across scales, taking into consideration both climatic and non-climatic stress factors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eriksen--2015">Eriksen et al., 2015</a>). For instance, from the agricultural perspective, this could imply the understanding by farmers of change in risk profiles to the establishment of efficient markets that facilitate response strategies. It is also important to note that science, too, has to adapt employing a range of approaches, based on the fact that multidisciplinary problems require multidisciplinary solutions. Towards enhancing resilience, a focus on integrated rather than disciplinary science alone could be of utmost importance as well as strengthening of the interface with key stakeholders, ranging from decision makers, practitioners, policymakers and scientists.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="8.5.2"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">8.5.2 Enabling Environments for Adaptation in Different Socioeconomic Contexts <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-15-siblings"><div class="h3-container" id="8.5.2.1"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">8.5.2.1 Factors that Support Enabling Environments for Adaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-28-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This section assesses the literature on components of the enabling environment for adaptation.

A range of economic and non-economic impacts can be experienced.

In terms of international law, the human rights obligations of states have been subject to multiple recommendations relating to climate change by United Nations treaty bodies in the reporting period. More broadly, rights-based approaches rely on the normative framework of human rights, requiring adaptation to be non-discriminatory, participatory, transparent and accountable in both formal (e.g., legal and regulatory) and informal (e.g., social or cultural norms) settings and at international, national and sub-national scales (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ensor--2015">Ensor et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Arts--2017">Arts, 2017</a>).

At a national scale, it is well established that low-income countries are less well positioned to manage climate change impacts, being variously attributed to a lack of institutional, economic or financial capacity to adapt effectively (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tol--2007">Tol and Yohe, 2007</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Barr--2010">Barr et al., 2010</a>). It can be particularly difficult to adapt to drought, for example, when it occurs in the pre-conditions of poor water supplies and sanitation (see Box 8.5; <a class="section-link" data-title="Global Hotspots of Human Vulnerability to Climate Change" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.3.2">Section 8.3.2</a>), and in a context of corruption, governance failure and a lack of accountability. Adaptation productivity in higher-income countries is further supported by better infrastructure and stronger institutions—low adaptation efficiency is linked to lower government spending, higher inequalities in income distribution and poor governance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fankhauser--2014">Fankhauser and McDermott, 2014</a>). At smaller scales, even within a single socioeconomic setting, different groups require different kinds of adaptation support and exhibit different vulnerabilities to climate change impacts. Huynh and Stringer (2018) found that households vulnerable to climate change impacts linked to sea level rise and flooding in Da Nang City and Ngu Hanh Son district, Vietnam, had limited access to human, natural, physical, financial and social assets, and lacked a diversified livelihood portfolio. An enabling environment for household-level adaptation would need to address these factors in this context. However, the same authors found that at district scale, different challenges persisted, including obstacles to multidirectional flows of climate information, poor vertical interplay both upward and downward, and a lack of citizen participation in the governance of climate change.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Acknowledging that context and scale matter, it is nevertheless possible to set out the core components of a generic enabling environment (Figure 8.12), linking them to the literature on climate change and recognising how they can support adaptation in different socioeconomic and environmental settings in which different emphases are required. This broad set of enablers requires different emphases according to the specific context, yet the interdependence between them is universally applicable.</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer045"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-13" id="figure-8-012" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_8_012.png"></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 8.12 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Core components of the enabling environment for adaptation to climate change</span><span lang> (key interactions are illustrated but there are overlaps, interactions and feedbacks both within and between each item; and different countries have different capacities and starting points in addressing these enablers and the interlinkages between them). </span></p></div><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The specific political economy of each country and its underpinning philosophies shape the national political context in which public policy supporting adaptation is developed and implemented. It further shapes the context for private adaptation. Public policy targeting climate change seeks to address market failures, amend policy distortions and offer incentives for private adaptation, as well as provide climate-resilient public goods, climate services and safety nets for the poor and vulnerable (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fankhauser--2017">Fankhauser, 2017</a>). In some countries that have a more stable institutional context, such policies are more straightforward to develop and implement; while in countries with weaker institutions (e.g., those emerging from conflict), a larger role may be needed for regional economic commissions and transnational networks to support the governance of ‘borderless climate risks’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Benzie--2019">Benzie and Persson, 2019</a>), particularly where these countries also are most vulnerable to climate change (see also Figure 8.6). To support enabling conditions in highly vulnerable countries that are also characterised by state fragility (see Figure 8.8), funding and projects designed to support adaptation may need to be modified to effectively promote regional cooperation and transboundary adaptation. Nevertheless, such interventions can also reinforce particularly powerful agendas and fail to assist and empower those with the greatest need to adapt (<a class="reference-link" href="#Biermann--2010">Biermann et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Burch--2019">Burch et al., 2019</a>) neglecting community voices and sovereignty (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schlosberg--2014">Schlosberg and Collins, 2014</a>). It is therefore important that the relevance of people and community empowerment to effectively achieve vulnerability reduction and climate change adaptation is recognised.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">It is also insufficient to consider countries as stand-alone entities, due to links such as those provided by international trade. Taking Europe as an example, the continent has strong links to major trade partners such as India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Vietnam, so failure to assist adaptation in other locations opens up important vulnerabilities through supply chains (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lung--2017">Lung et al., 2017</a>). Policies seeking to protect national interests alone (e.g., in terms of food security) are seen as causes of negative impacts at a global scale (<a class="reference-link" href="#Puma--2015">Puma et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Challinor--2017">Challinor et al., 2017</a>), with those nations and individuals least able to adapt to evolving climate changes experiencing exacerbation of existing imbalances (<a class="reference-link" href="#Elbehri--2015">Elbehri et al., 2015</a>). LDCs are projected to suffer greater import losses in more connected networks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Puma--2015">Puma et al., 2015</a>).

The IPCC has estimated that limiting the rise in global average surface temperatures to 1.5°C would require between USD 1.6 trillion to USD 3.8 trillion of annual investment in supply-side energy systems (those that generate energy) between 2016 and 2050 (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018b">IPCC, 2018b</a>). Resource allocations, however, are shaped by perceptions of the risks of climate change and the urgency of actions, as well as other motivational factors such as descriptive norms and perceived self-efficacy (<a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Valkengoed--2019">van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019</a>) and the underlying approaches taken to valuing human well-being (e.g., see work from Bhutan on Gross National Happiness and climate change actions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kamei--2021">Kamei et al., 2021</a>)).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">An increase in finance mobilised, however, does not automatically equate to adaptation interventions on the ground, nor does it guarantee the effectiveness of those adaptations deployed (<a class="reference-link" href="#Berrang-Ford--2021">Berrang-Ford et al., 2021</a>). Unintended negative consequences may arise due to lack of understanding of the drivers of vulnerability (such as gender inequality or inequitable access to natural resources), non-involvement of marginalised local groups, retrofitting adaptation into existing development agendas, and insufficiently defining adaptation success (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eriksen--2021">Eriksen et al., 2021</a>). A 2017 study estimated that less than 10% of climate finance committed from international, regional and national climate funds to developing countries between 2003 and 2016 went to locally focused projects, suggesting a need to rethink approaches if the most affected groups are to build sufficient resilience to the impacts of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Soanes--2017">Soanes et al., 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The literature shows with <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> that the poorest groups in society often lose out, and require greater planned adaptation support, having less capacity to adapt than better off groups with easy access to assets (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barbier--2018">Barbier and Hochard, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ziervogel--2019b">Ziervogel, 2019b</a>; Box 8.5). Developing countries such as Burkina Faso, Mali and Zambia are not only among the most vulnerable to climate change, they are also the least able to mobilise the finance needed to adapt to its impacts (ND-GAIN, 2019). Women and girls are often most heavily burdened. When building adaptive capacity, these groups can require different support such that their knowledge, capacities and skills can be harnessed, in such a way that does not feminise responsibility and add to their burdens (<a class="reference-link" href="#Clissold--2020">Clissold et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McNamara--2021a">McNamara et al., 2021a</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There is broad support for the notion, enshrined in the Paris Agreement, that adaptation finance flowing to developing countries of the Global South should primarily benefit the most climate-vulnerable among them due to their limited technical capacity and financial capabilities, yet such countries are often insufficiently considered in funding decisions. There are nevertheless concerns regarding institutional fit: that foreign funding regimes may not map onto more recently developed administrative traditions, leading to dominance of governance models emanating from donors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vink--2018">Vink and Schouten, 2018</a>). Research has found multilateral donors do not prioritise vulnerable developing countries at the project selection stage and they have received smaller allocations of adaptation finance from bilateral donors than less vulnerable countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Saunders--2019">Saunders, 2019</a>), leaving the poor vulnerable to climate impacts. The lack of climate finance flowing to LDCs and SIDs (currently 14% and 2% of the total, respectively) is compounded by access issues due to the inability of domestic institutions to meet specific fiduciary standards and other access requirements, insufficient human resource support and the inflexibility of current approaches, which are biased in favour of governments and against non-traditional actors, such as local enterprise and grassroots organisations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shakya--2021">Shakya et al., 2021</a>). Further, vulnerable developing countries shoulder additional financial burden, embodied in higher interest payments to service public and private debt, due to the increased cost of capital brought about by greater exposure to climate risks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Buhr--2018">Buhr et al., 2018</a>). This has been further exacerbated by the recession and debt distress accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kose--2021">Kose et al., 2021</a>). A range of reforms, including comprehensive debt relief by public creditors, green recovery bonds, debt-for-climate swaps and new SDG-aligned debt instruments may address unsustainable debt burdens, freeing up investment in climate adaptation and a green economic recovery (<a class="reference-link" href="#Volz--2020">Volz et al., 2020</a>; see <a class="section-link" data-title="Coverage of Adaptation Finance" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.6.3.1">Section 8.6.3.1</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Greater investment is also needed in the developed countries of the Global North. For example, the 2018 forest fires in Sweden, the 2019–2020 Australian bushfire season and the 2020 forest fire season along the US West Coast were unusually long and severe, resulting in unprecedented damage to natural habitats and human livelihoods and, relatedly, significant economic cost, particularly given interlinkages with other stressors such as COVID-19. While a range of drivers underpin annual fire seasons, including greater water withdrawal and years of fire suppression, early research indicates that climate change increases their likelihood due to long-term warming trends (<a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Oldenborgh--2021a">van Oldenborgh et al., 2021a</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">However, investing in poverty reduction does not necessarily lead to climate change adaptation and where adaptation does result, it does not always reduce vulnerability of the most marginalised, as documented in case studies from northeast Brazil (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nelson--2016">Nelson et al., 2016</a>). Poverty also affects private adaptation options. For example, research from Portugal highlights the importance of private financial assets in helping older adults to adapt to extreme temperatures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nunes--2018">Nunes, 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Policies and investments that are adopted are embedded within the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks, which extend beyond national jurisdictions upward to the regional scale (such as the Southern Africa Development Community’s Southern Africa Regional Framework of Climate Change Programmes, 2010) and international scale, for example, UNFCCC, the 2015 Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the New Urban Agenda and the SDGs. Legal and regulatory concerns also extend downward to shape local- and city-scale adaptation efforts (e.g., Sao Paulo’s municipal policy and new master plan). Nevertheless, only a minority of countries have dedicated legal frameworks supporting adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lesnikowski--2017">Lesnikowski et al., 2017</a>) and these often lack in both precision and obligation—largely because adaptation is a contested global public good but also because adaptation is commonly bundled in with mitigation commitments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hall--2018">Hall and Persson, 2018</a>). Coherence, horizontally and vertically in both policy and law is often lacking. At the same time, bottom-up, private, autonomous adaptation efforts are being better tracked, with different actors motivated by growing experiences of local climate change impacts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Berrang-Ford--2014">Berrang-Ford et al., 2014</a>). While the emergent polycentricity of adaptation governance is beginning to take shape, wherein both state and non-state actors share a common adaptation goal and interact coherently, yet often independently, to advance progress towards it (<a class="reference-link" href="#Morrison--2019">Morrison et al., 2019</a>), understandings of how various centres of decision making with different degrees of autonomy support an enabling environment for adaptation, remain at a nascent stage. Multiple scales and forms of adaptation occur, with attributes such as self-organisation, appreciation of site-specific conditions, and the need for learning and experimentation, alongside building of trust, increasingly shown to be vital (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dorsch--2017">Dorsch and Flachsland, 2017</a>). Literature indicates that professional and learning networks are important groups supporting adaptation in cities and can help harness resources (<a class="reference-link" href="#Woodruff--2018">Woodruff, 2018</a>); while the research of (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hauge--2019">Hauge et al., 2019</a>) in Norway underscores the importance of working across multiple disciplines and the inclusion of actors from different levels of authority in multi-level municipal networks. They found that these factors can help to identify specific adaptation actions as well support knowledge sharing within participating organisations, which in turn helps garner commitment to adaptation and its implementation. They also found that it is important to involve local leaders in polycentric adaptation networks.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Among the many institutions, actors and roles associated with successful adaptation, two play an increasingly important role: local governments and the private sector (<a class="reference-link" href="#Noble--2014">Noble et al., 2014</a>). These groups often define the flows of information and finance from the top down, as well as supporting the scaling up of community and household adaptation. In some countries, for example, in South America (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay) vocational agricultural schools, often in remote rural locations, play a key part in knowledge-sharing activities that support adaptation. Similar valuable contributions are made by universities through their outreach activities, particularly those offering programmes in environmental and agricultural fields. Many actors face a lack of resources and capacity, particularly at the local level. Local institutions, including local governments, NGOs and civil society organisations, are hampered by ongoing challenges in gaining support from higher governance levels—from national government or the international community—particularly in developing countries. At the same time, private sector actors, from individual farmers and small/medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as large multinational businesses, will seek to protect and enhance their production systems, supply chains and markets by pursuing adaptation-related opportunities. Yet, while these goals will help expand adaptation activities, they may not align with government or community objectives and priorities without coordination and incentives, and in the process, can reinforce existing capacities, inequalities and power relations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sovacool--2015">Sovacool et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, an enabling environment for businesses’ adaptation is highly differentiated and often requires structural deficits (such as limited market access, finance and transport and communications infrastructure) to be tackled (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gannon--2020">Gannon et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The challenges of climate change have driven governments around the world to emphasise climate services as a route to enhance decision making and reduce climate-related risks, as well as inform adaptation, supporting calls for the right to information (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tall--2013">Tall and Njinga, 2013</a>). While there have been some efforts to evaluate the economic impact of climate services alongside other impacts (e.g, <a class="reference-link" href="#Tall--2018">Tall et al., 2018</a>), little is known about the institutional contexts in which investments in climate services have taken place, nor those groups that are most vulnerable or marginalised in relation to specific climate risks. <a class="reference-link" href="#Vincent--2017">Vincent et al. (2017)</a> offer preliminary insights from Malawi, identifying that barriers to improved integration of climate services in national policy planning include factors relating to spatial and temporal scale, accessibility and timing of information provision, credibility and mismatches in time frames between planning cycles and climate projections. An understanding of the factors that enable climate service investment is important for the development of climate services at local, national and international levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vaughan--2017">Vaughan et al., 2017</a>) but this area of literature is not yet well developed.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Overall, adaptation entails financial (and non-financial) costs not just in implementing adaptation actions, but also in designing, facilitating and preparing for actions—costs to create and maintain an enabling environment (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Detection and Attribution of Observed Impacts and Responses" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.2">Section 8.2.2.3</a>; Cross-Chapter Box LOSS in Chapter 17).

Costs may be borne when gaining information (e.g., investments in climate services), while adjustment costs are incurred as adaptations take place. Nevertheless, to enable adaptation, investment is needed in various natural, human, physical and social assets, as considered below. The importance of investment in each of these different types of asset varies according to the scale and livelihood system in need of adaptation and the ways in which livelihood resilience is framed and power is distributed, within each specific setting (<a class="reference-link" href="#Carr--2020">Carr, 2020</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="8.5.2.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">8.5.2.2 Natural Capital <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-29-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">It is well established that climate change compounds the impacts of pressures that humans place on the environment (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) and that environmental degradation can undermine options for adaptation and an enabling environment, with poor and natural resource-dependent groups most acutely affected (see e.g., <a class="section-link" data-title="Deserts, semi-arid areas, and desertification" href="/chapter/cross-chapter-paper-3"> Cross-Chapter Paper 3</a> for insights from deserts and semiarid areas). Sustainable management of natural capital contributes to building resilience and the natural ability of ecosystems to adapt to climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>; see also IPCC SROCC, <a class="section-link" data-title="Methodologies for Assessing Vulnerabilities and Adaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-5#5.3.2">Section 5.3.2</a>, <a class="reference-link" href="#Bindoff--2019">Bindoff et al., 2019</a>). Some systems like mangroves (found in 123 countries, many of which are in the Developing World) offer a broad range of vital ecosystem services (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hamza--2020">Hamza et al., 2020</a>). Mangroves provide regulating services by acting as a natural defence against sea level rise and storm surges; and by sequestering carbon in both the trees and sediments they capture. Provisioning services (e.g., fish, crabs, timber and fuelwood) from mangroves support livelihoods and livelihood adaptation options, especially for those with few other livelihood opportunities, while these systems also provide important habitat (breeding, spawning and nursery grounds for fish) and biodiversity, and offer cultural services in the forms of education, recreation and spiritual benefits (<a class="reference-link" href="#Quinn--2017">Quinn et al., 2017</a>). As the frequency of events such as hurricanes, storms and typhoons rises with climate change, natural capital assets like mangroves become increasingly important in protecting coastlines and supporting adaptation. While not reducing the hazard itself, the mangroves reduce exposure and, in some cases, also vulnerability. The literature shows with <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> that environmental assets support both climate change mitigation (at a large scale) and adaptation (at a smaller scale), particularly for the poorest groups in society, who directly depend upon natural capital for their subsistence (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Angelsen--2014">Angelsen et al., 2014</a>). In turn, the legal and regulatory context and institutional set up determines who has access rights to different aspects of the natural resource base. This shows how different aspects of the enabling environment work in tandem to constitute one another.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In a market economy, human activities tend to exacerbate degradation of natural capital, despite its role in buffering climate change impacts, supporting mitigation and providing adaptation options. Economic agents base their decisions on market prices, even though market prices do not incorporate the costs of deteriorating natural capital because of externalities and other market failures, that is environmental degradation is not internalised (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bowen--2012">Bowen et al., 2012</a>). At the same time, expanding populations, capitalism and consumption choices affect the condition of natural capital, alongside short-termism stemming from poverty, linked to the need for survival. All these factors therefore interact, with the aggregate effect of worsening the impacts of climate change, while also undermining future adaptation options, particularly for the poor. Adaptation policies should, but do not always, compensate for the prevalent market failures. For example, in Melanesia, sea walls have been built out of coral by local people in an attempt to reduce the impacts of rising sea levels, leading to outright destruction of some of the world’s most productive and biodiverse coral reefs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Martin--2016">Martin and Watson, 2016</a>). Similarly, in the Congo Basin, farmers are adapting to increasingly variable rainfall by expanding their cropping activities into forested areas, releasing carbon into the atmosphere through forest clearance activities and threatening biodiversity. Agricultural land is also being degraded globally (see <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019a">IPCC, 2019a</a>), and this too closes down adaptation and livelihood options for the poorest, natural resource-dependent populations, while jeopardising food security, biodiversity and human health at wider scales. An enabling environment for adaptation therefore demands investment in sustaining natural capital at multiple scales, internalising the costs of degradation, as well as establishing the necessary legal and regulatory frameworks (and associated enforcement) to reduce its degradation (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPBES--2018">IPBES, 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The literature increasingly shows that approaches such as nature-based solutions (NBS) and ecosystem-based adaptation (see Chapters 2; 6) can offer value for money in tackling climate change from both a mitigation and adaptation standpoint (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seddon--2020">Seddon et al., 2020</a>). According to the Global Commission on Adaptation, a global investment of USD 1.8 trillion between 2020 and 2030 into adaptation measures such as early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved dryland agriculture, mangrove protection, and resilient water resources can yield USD 7.1 trillion in total net benefits (<a class="reference-link" href="#Global%20Commission%20on%20Adaptation--2019">Global Commission on Adaptation, 2019</a>). NBS operate by harnessing natural processes, sometimes in combination with technological or engineered solutions. Examples encompass green public spaces and parks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sahakian--2020">Sahakian and Anantharaman, 2020</a>), green infrastructure, such as urban forests and street trees (<a class="reference-link" href="#Richards--2017">Richards and Edwards, 2017</a>), which create shade and reduce urban heat island effects whereby urban areas are warmer than their surroundings (<a class="reference-link" href="#Depietri--2013">Depietri et al., 2013</a>), and support human health and well-being by keeping people in cities more closely linked with nature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gulsrud--2018">Gulsrud et al., 2018</a>).

Impacts on health are also experienced, through food insecurity resulting from climate change, including malnutrition, as well as through loss of livelihoods, making it more difficult to afford and to access health services.

For millennia, local communities have relied heavily upon culturally accumulated Indigenous knowledge, participating in landscapes as stewards of their environment, engaged in profoundly detailed livelihood strategies that deal with natural hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ajayi--2017">Ajayi and Mafongoya, 2017</a>). Indigenous knowledge systems are embedded in culture, and are passed from generation to generation in various ways: livelihoods, traditions, spiritual practices and oral tradition, cultural identity and historical memory. Indigenous knowledge is known or learnt from experience, or acquired through observation and practice, and handed down from generation to generation. It is acknowledged that Indigenous communities, particularly those in hazard-prone areas, have developed a profound understanding and knowledge of disaster prevention and mitigation, early warning, preparedness and response, and post-disaster recovery. Indigenous knowledge systems, themselves, are an indispensable dimension of capacity for adaptation, and where threatened represent a major risk to Indigenous communities. While still robust among Indigenous Peoples in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, Indigenous knowledge is not well reflected or incorporated in assessments such as this, and stands in danger of being lost as its custodians are passing away. </span></p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Indigenous knowledge about natural hazards enables communities at risk to take steps to reduce climate risk. Indigenous knowledge systems are locally indispensable resources for adaptation to climate change, yet are often misunderstood and undervalued. Generally, Indigenous Peoples and other local groups hold relevant local-scale knowledge about environmental change, the impacts of those changes on ecosystems and livelihoods at local scales, and possible locally effective adaptive responses. However, it is important that IKLK is situated within knowledge from other scales in order to assess its broader relevance and applicability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ahlborg--2012">Ahlborg and Nightingale, 2012</a>). Some authors suggest including Indigenous knowledge in the IPCC assessment process should be of high priority, as it is becoming increasingly relevant for climate services (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Strauss--2003">Strauss and Orlove, 2003</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Crate--2009">Crate and Nuttall, 2009</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Crate--2011">Crate, 2011</a>). Their knowledge can draw attention to climate baselines and change, and identify adaptation priorities, such as plant and animal species that should be protected given local contextual environmental considerations. For example, using Indigenous knowledge in weather and climate prediction, local communities in different parts of Tanzania have been coping with, and adapting to, increased climate variability normally manifested in the form of increased frequency and magnitude of various exigencies, including droughts and floods, and outbreak of pests and diseases (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kijazi--2013">Kijazi et al., 2013</a>). Prediction of impending hazards has been an integral part of Indigenous Peoples’ adaptation strategies. Various environmental and astronomical indicators are used to predict rainfall, including plant phenology, behaviour and movement of birds, animal and insects, in many parts of Tanzania (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kijazi--2013">Kijazi et al., 2013</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There are efforts in developing adaptation plans that utilise local knowledge. Local knowledge-based adaptation is focused primarily on the use of traditional knowledge to increase adaptive capacity at the community level and less on integration (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mimura--2014">Mimura et al., 2014</a>). Hence, there is need to increase effectiveness of policy processes that work towards integration of local and scientific knowledge (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nakashima--2013">Nakashima et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="8.5.2.4"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">8.5.2.4 Physical Capital <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-31-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Ensuring sufficient investment in physical capital is vital to support development pathways at the national level, but for the poorest and most marginalised in society, physical capital represents an invaluable source of adaptation options (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hallegatte--2019">Hallegatte et al., 2019</a>). Physical capital constitutes assets such as land, roads and other infrastructure (e.g., water supplies, electricity, mobile phone connectivity), housing and other buildings, as well as the materials and tools needed to make a living (e.g., farming, forestry and fishing equipment, transportation vehicles, technology). It can also help to foster a sense of place, and can support well-being. Climate change impacts on physical capital are often widespread, as well as economically and emotionally costly, particularly when communities are afflicted by hardship (inadequate levels of sustainable human development through access to essential public goods and services and access to income opportunities) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Abbott--2004">Abbott and Pollard, 2004</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Given the massive scale of investments required to build and sustain physical capital at the state level, it is imperative to ensure physical capital decisions consider climate resilience; not least because retrofitting and replacing are both highly costly. The World Bank estimates that adapting over the period 2010–2050 to a world that is 2°C warmer by 2050 will cost USD 70 billion to USD 100 billion per annum, with the infrastructure sector accounting for the largest share of costs (<a class="reference-link" href="#World%20Bank--2010">World Bank, 2010</a>). At the same time, every USD 1 invested in preventive measures can save USD 5 of repairs (<a class="reference-link" href="#PRIF--2013">PRIF, 2013</a>). While adequate financing and technical expertise are required, as well as foresight in planning and design and climate risk screening, successful adaptation relating to physical capital also demands legal and institutional enablers (e.g., development and enforcement of building codes and regulations; roll out of insurance options; planning restrictions to reduce construction in locations that are highly exposed to climate hazards, etc). In some situations, these are lacking. For example, low-lying LDCs, such as Bangladesh, as well as SIDS, regularly suffer from climate events such as floods, typhoons, cyclones, hurricanes and saline intrusion (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Small Islands" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-15">Chapter 15</a> on small islands). Hazards such as typhoons cause substantial damage and destruction, impede mobility, reduce connectivity, disrupt communications, food, water and energy supplies, and render people homeless and without the assets they rely on to make a living. In the absence of adequate legal and institutional enablers, as well as livelihood assets, the maintenance of physical capital is far more challenging, as the case of Cyclone Aila in Box 8.8 demonstrates.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Physical capital in the form of technology is increasingly supporting climate change adaptation, despite that innovations can be rolled out under high uncertainty, opening up new risks (e.g., hacking). Moreover, deployment of technology is closely tied to other forms of capital, especially human capital, and innovations cannot just be rolled out in the absence of suitable institutional and technical support and training. Similarly, access to finance is vital. Some technological adaptations require a pre-existing level of infrastructure and literacy, raising important questions about inequality (<a class="reference-link" href="#Taylor--2018">Taylor, 2018</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Rotz--2019">Rotz et al.

Adequate testing of technologies in terms of their applicability to different contexts is also required, ensuring they do not become maladaptive when applied at scale.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Similarly, technology must always be grounded in an appreciation of the cultural context. Research in the European Arctic with the Indigenous Sami Peoples found that use of GPS technology on reindeer, together with supplementary feeding, offered useful adaptations for some herders. However, there are fears such technologies may, over time, reduce the skills, cultural knowledge and Indigenous adaptations of the Sami (<a class="reference-link" href="#Andersson--2017">Andersson and Keskitalo, 2017</a>), as, for example, reindeer become tamer through supplementary feeding, affecting their range selection.

There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span> but <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span> about the importance and role of social and cultural factors in shaping adaptation, in terms of both the need to adapt and the way it is presented and communicated, although evidence is somewhat mixed in terms of how experiences of weather affect opinions and perceptions of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Howe--2019">Howe et al., 2019</a>). Research also highlights the importance of context in understanding relations between perceptions of risks and behaviour, arguing that power relations and other obstacles and opportunities play a vital role in shaping actions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rufat--2020">Rufat et al., 2020</a>). In general, nonetheless, adaptation is spurred when people perceive that there is an action they can take to make a difference (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kuruppu--2011">Kuruppu and Liverman, 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mayer--2019">Mayer and Smith, 2019</a>), although it cannot be assumed that action will be taken if the socio-cultural setting is not amenable and it contravenes the values underlying people’s perceptions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kwon--2019">Kwon et al., 2019</a>). Research testing for the effect of beliefs on behavioural change from 48 countries highlighted the need for policy leaders to present climate change as solvable yet challenging, if fatalistic beliefs that act as barriers to adaptation were to be reduced (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mayer--2019">Mayer and Smith, 2019</a>). This demonstrates how beliefs do not always reinforce actions, even when risks are perceived. Similarly, research from Burkina Faso working with the Fulbe ethnic group found that cultural norms restricted engagement in four of the most successful livelihood strategies that support adaptation to climate change (labour migration, working for development projects, gardening and female engagement in economic activities) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nielsen--2010">Nielsen and Reenberg, 2010</a>). Cultural factors therefore play an important but under-researched role in adaptation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Social factors in the context of adaptation, by contrast, are more widely studied. The literature on adaptation and the role of social capital as an enabler is diverse. There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> that during disasters, social capital plays an important role in linking those who are affected to external supports and resources. On small islands, social networks can be dense and support adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Petzold--2015">Petzold and Ratter, 2015</a>), with traditional knowledge and societal cohesion helping small island communities to have self-belief and build resilience even in the absence of external interventions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nunn--2018">Nunn and Kumar, 2018</a>). Even the development of weak ties (e.g., one-way information transfer) can lead to the establishment of mutual collaboration relations that can be more easily drawn on in times of climate change-related shocks and stresses (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ingold--2017">Ingold, 2017</a>), while collective shared disaster experiences can cause new social groups to emerge and spur action, linked to a perceived common fate (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ntontis--2020">Ntontis et al., 2020</a>). However, this can exacerbate inequalities and create new ones, with those who are more connected having enhanced access to, for example, shelters following storm evacuations or earthquakes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rahill--2014">Rahill et al., 2014</a>). In adapting to more incremental changes, social capital has been shown to increase shared local knowledge and awareness, support participatory processes and strengthen ties to corporate and political institutions, increasing their responsiveness to local concerns, as shown by examples from Aldrich et al. (2016). They describe how in Houma, Louisiana, located west of New Orleans, rising sea levels and hurricane risks have drawn on and built social capital at the community level. Having what was perceived locally as insufficient federal government support, residents, church groups and town council members collaborated to spur adaptation. Community mobilisation led to construction of self-funded levees and water projects to protect 200,000 residents from storm surges. Projects include marshland restoration, the elevation of existing housing, improved pumping systems and canal drainage, as well as buyouts and relocations of businesses and housing that has been repetitively damaged. Funds were raised from households through donations via a self-imposed sales tax. While this example paints a positive picture of the role of social capital and collective action in adaptation activities, it also raises questions about the coherence of actions across levels, again, highlighting a role for polycentric governance if risks of maladaptation are to be reduced. The danger in the example presented here is that should federal plans conflict with the community level work in the future, local efforts may have been in vain if installations have to be removed. This highlights the importance of careful evaluation of all adaptation options on an ongoing basis.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Further warnings about social capital as an adaptation enabler come from <a class="reference-link" href="#Acosta--2016">Acosta et al. (2016)</a> who recognise that it may be detrimental to private adaptation in some cases. Their research in rural Ethiopia found that qualitative measures of trust predict contributions to public goods, supporting theories about collective action, but that the effects of social capital are not homogenous: it can be helpful in some contexts, but unhelpful, or even detrimental in others. This led them to highlight the need for policymakers to consider these potentially different outcomes. Other research, also from Ethiopia, suggested that households with more social capital are more specialised in their livelihood strategies. This could leave them more vulnerable to climate change impacts (as per the Cyclone Aila example where shrimp farmers were specialised and hit hardest by the cyclone’s impacts), though social capital acts as a kind of informal insurance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wuepper--2018">Wuepper et al., 2018</a>).</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-8.7"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 8.7 | Addressing inequalities in national capabilities: common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities relating to adaptation and the Paris Agreement</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-26-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC) is a key principle within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and attempts to acknowledge countries’ diverse development situations.

It calls for a balance between mitigation and adaptation funding and emphasises the need to provide developing country parties, especially the most vulnerable, with ‘[c]ontinuous and enhanced international support’ for adaptation. The basis for differentiation under Article 7 therefore relies mostly on diverse national circumstances, capabilities and vulnerabilities.

Article 7 is interpreted here as a breakthrough, containing unprecedented provisions that give adaptation prominence and which elevate the importance of undertaking adequate action to cope with current and future climate change impacts. A second view argues that the Article 7 marks little departure from previous efforts to support adaptation efforts in developing countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Doelle--2016">Doelle, 2016</a>) or that it could have included stronger provisions, such as a quantitative goal with respect to adaptation needs and costs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bodansky--2016">Bodansky, 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">The literature nevertheless shows <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span> that other parts of the Paris Agreement do contain consequential provisions on adaptation and the operationalisation of the CBDR-RC principle.

While provision of support from developed parties continues to be mandatory, these ‘other parties’, apparently developing country parties, are ‘encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily’ (Article 9.2). Parties themselves determine whether they belong to this category. So far, several developing countries have made contributions to the Green Climate Fund, ranging from Indonesia and Mexico to Mongolia and Panama (Green Climate Fund, 2017).

Suggestions of physical interventions that are needed include higher and stronger dykes, cyclone-resistant housing, active maintenance and strict policing of embankment use and good governance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Abdullah--2016">Abdullah et al., 2016</a>). Enabling formal institutions could help, for instance, by improving the climate resilience of physical capital (e.g., by developing and enforcing building codes for houses). Other institutional mechanisms could help to improve access to low interest credit, prevent maladaptation, improve enforcement of laws, and provide insurance. However, such institutional reforms need to be co-developed with local people and incorporate local cultural mechanisms (<a class="reference-link" href="#Islam--2017">Islam and Nursey-Bray, 2017</a>). Future adaptation strategies also need to consider the limits to autonomous adaptation (i.e. that without external intervention) and differential level of impacts and adaptive capacities among different groups of households in the Aila-affected areas. This example illustrates the importance of a more comprehensive approach to resilience building, and the need to better understand the interlinkages between the core components of an enabling environment for adaptation (see Figure 8.12).</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1"><div class="Box_Header-continued" id="_idContainer046"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_continued-subhead" lang="en-GB">Box 8.8</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="8.6"><h1 class="Headings_H1-numbered" lang="en-GB">8.6 Climate Resilient Development for the Poor and Pro-poor Adaptation Finance: Ensuring Climate Justice and Sustainable Development </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-7-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This section evaluates climate resilient development (CRD) focusing on potential synergies between adaptation and mitigation in different sectors, decision-making approaches and adaptation finance, especially for the poor.

Where development is not sustainable, especially if it is not equitable, capacity for adapting is greatly reduced—a phenomenon known as the adaptation gap (Figure 8.14; <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2021a">Birkmann et al., 2021a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2021">UNEP, 2021</a>). Figure 8.14 depicts the effect of development trajectories (as described in the SSPs framework) on capacity for adaptation, a key determinant of eventual outcomes. Achieving CRD through coupling adaptation with equitable sustainable development under and low emissions profiles that limit warming to 1.5°C (i.e., sustainability scenario) is necessary to close the adaptation gap. Even if emissions are kept low and 1.5°C emissions targets are achieved, if poverty and inequality remain high, then impacts are expected to remain high and may overwhelm capacity for adaptation. High poverty and high inequality in a society (i.e., inequality scenario) reduce the likelihood that countries are able to manage risk and avoid residual impacts, such as also documented in the assessment above (see Sections 8.2; 8.3; 8.4). Unsustainable development trajectories reduce capacity for adaptation and may result in highly unequally distributed residual impacts from climate change. Even despite rapid, equitable development and modest emissions reductions efforts necessary to limit warming to 2°C (i.e., the middle of the road scenario), there is still risk of unequal distribution of impacts. Under all high emissions scenarios (&gt;3°C warming), universal residual impacts are unavoidable.</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer051"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-15" id="figure-8-014" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_8_014.png"></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 8.14 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Conceptual figure illustrating the link between sustainable development and the adaptation gap. </span>Even if emissions are kept low, if poverty and inequality remain high, then impacts are expected to remain high and may overwhelm capacity for adaptation.</p></div><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Mitigation planning has not sufficiently considered poverty reduction policies, the basis for narrowing the adaptation gap (see also Figure 8.14). Many synergies between climate change mitigation and poverty reduction have been identified, although sometimes with <span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>. The mitigation measures that have been most evaluated include clean development mechanisms (CDM), programmes aimed at reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), voluntary carbon offsets and biofuel production. However, while these mitigation programmes stimulate economic growth, they may contribute to processes that trade-off against equitable development and threaten to further impoverish forest communities, such as large-scale land acquisitions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Carter--2017">Carter et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schaafsma--2021">Schaafsma et al., 2021</a>) and fortress conservation (see IPCC SR 1.5°C, <a class="section-link" data-title="Food, fibre, and other ecosystem products" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-5">Chapter 5</a> (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al., 2018</a>); and see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Cities, settlements and key infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6">Chapter 6</a> of this report).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019a">IPCC, 2019a</a>) states that agriculture, food production and deforestation are major drivers of climate change and calls for coordinated action to tackle climate change that can simultaneously improve land, food security and nutrition, and help to end hunger. There are five land challenges identified including climate change mitigation, adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security. This report identified three major categories of climate response options that show promise for achieving mitigation and increasing capacity for adaptation while addressing poverty: SLM options, value chain management and risk management options (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019a">IPCC, 2019a</a>). For example, programmes supporting no-till agriculture and residue retention allow small-scale farmers to participate in mitigation and adaptation activities, with long-term benefits to soil health and food, energy and water security (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wright--2014">Wright et al., 2014</a>). Likewise, the installation of a solar powered drip irrigation system simultaneously reduces emission, improves water security and increases farmers’ income (<a class="reference-link" href="#Locatelli--2015">Locatelli et al., 2015</a>). Response options in terms of SLM options, and value chain and risk management involve interlinkages between land-based climate strategies, synergies and trade-offs (see Chapter 6). On the other hand, a key trade-off is the potential for maladaptation, where one adaptation intervention at one time, location or sector could increase the vulnerability at another time, location or sector, or increase the vulnerability of the target group to future climate change (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence, high agreement </span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eriksen--2011">Eriksen et al., 2011</a>). A cause of increasing concern to adaptation planners is the understanding of maladaptation has changed subtly to recognise that it arises inadvertently, from poorly planned adaptation actions, but also from carefully deliberated decisions where wider considerations place greater emphasis on singular or short-term outcomes ahead of broader, longer-term threats, or discount, or fail to consider, the full range of interactions arising from the planned actions across scales (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eriksen--2021">Eriksen et al., 2021</a>). Research identifies the challenge of avoiding maladaptation as one of reducing long-term structural vulnerability. Accordingly, one can consider CCD and maladaptation as two sides of the same coin. Scholars of ‘sustainable adaptation’ define it as adaptation that contributes to socially and environmentally sustainable development pathways, which takes into account both social justice and environmental integrity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eriksen--2011">Eriksen et al., 2011</a>). The parallels in maladaptation include the underlying drivers of vulnerability, namely socio-environmental processes such as conflict, marginalisation, economic restructuring, exploitation, institutional fragility and so forth (<a class="reference-link" href="#Antwi-Agyei--2018b">Antwi-Agyei et al., 2018b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Neef--2018">Neef et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Harnessing opportunities for mitigation, adaptation and development in an effective manner may lead to ‘triple wins’ under CRD, though empirical evidence is extremely rare for such triple win strategies that address mitigation, adaptation and development in an effective manner (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tompkins--2013">Tompkins et al., 2013</a>). Integration of mitigation, adaptation and development is being initiated and operationalised through projects by several developing countries to achieve main national development priorities, such as poverty reduction, increased employment opportunities, energy security and transportation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Denton--2014">Denton et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Stringer--2014">Stringer et al., 2014</a>). Important follow-on questions are pressing social questions about how trade-offs are deliberated, who wins and loses and who decides (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Future Vulnerabilities, Risks and Livelihood Challenges and Consequences for Equity and Sustainability" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.4">Section 8.4</a> and <a class="reference-link" href="#Ellis--2019">Ellis and Tschakert, 2019</a>). Likewise, the efficiency, effectiveness and feasibility trade-offs of climate policies must be considered (i.e., can programmes in developing countries be economically efficient and provide opportunities to achieve sustainable development targets for developing countries?) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dang--2003">Dang et al., 2003</a>). Moreover, questions about co-benefits must consider the benefit–cost ratio of mitigative versus adaptive action for assets saved from destruction by climate impacts, for example (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stadelmann--2014">Stadelmann et al., 2014</a>). Implementing a mitigation or adaptation option may positively or negatively, directly or indirectly, affect the feasibility and effectiveness of other options, such as soil management leading to soil organic carbon (<a class="reference-link" href="#Locatelli--2015">Locatelli et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Coninck--2018">de Coninck et al., 2018</a>). Farmers and local people are often also being encouraged to undertake mitigation and adaptation activities leading to long-term benefits, such as cultivation of no-till wheat with residue retention leading to low emissions along with saving energy and water (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wright--2014">Wright et al., 2014</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Moreover, a regulatory structure for evaluation of mitigation and adaptation actions is required to understand the co-benefits of these two actions.

The increasing access to electricity facilitates SDG 7 coupled with other SDGs and societal goals, including mitigation of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Vuuren--2018">van Vuuren et al., 2018</a>) through reducing energy consumption by the use of efficient technology and appliances.

Bioenergy can contribute to reducing emissions and energy inefficiencies in agricultural food and bioenergy sectors, while safeguarding food and energy security. However, recent literature also points towards significant tensions and mismatches between increasing bioenergy on agricultural land and local livelihoods and food security (<a class="reference-link" href="#Yildiz--2019">Yildiz, 2019</a>).

Nevertheless, synergies between bioenergy and food security can be promoted by integrated resource management designed to improve both food and water security and access to bioenergy; investments in technology, rural extension, promotion of stable prices to incentivise local production; and use of double cropping and flex crops to provide food and energy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Souza--2017">Souza et al., 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Trade-offs of bioenergy can be minimised by replacing land-intensive first-generation biofuels (e.g., oil palm) with second and subsequent generations (e.g., microalgae).

Contrasting impacts on environmental, economic and social sustainability are reported for production and use of biofuels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Azapagic--2011">Azapagic and Perdan, 2011</a>), ranging from positive impacts, such as reduction in GHG emissions, energy security and rural development, to negative impacts, such as risks of increasing food prices, increasing GHG emissions through direct and indirect land use change from production of biofuel feedstocks, and degradation of land, forests, water resources and ecosystems (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2009">UNEP, 2009</a>). Biofuel production may cause loss of biodiversity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jeswani--2020">Jeswani et al., 2020</a>) and may also impact various ecosystem services, such as land, water and food, and may pollute air, water and soil (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scovronick--2014">Scovronick and Wilkinson, 2014</a>).

Overall, the increased use of thermal solar panels contributes to reducing GHG emissions and improves air quality, as well as providing benefits to the community and the environment. The differential adoption of solar panels can be managed by simultaneous investment in other technologies that utilise renewable energy along with investment in solar panels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kaya--2019">Kaya et al., 2019</a>). Development of a smart electricity grid connected to a renewable energy source reduces GHG emissions and decreases vulnerability to climate change by enhancing the response to changing conditions and providing a more reliable service to the population (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hennessey--2017">Hennessey et al., 2017</a>). Moreover, development of policies for a low-carbon and climate-resilient power system, a local nexus between mitigation and adaptation could be explored (<a class="reference-link" href="#Handayani--2020">Handayani et al., 2020</a>). For example, use of efficient fuel in urban areas facilitates air pollution reduction and also provides health benefits for urban populations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ramaswami--2017">Ramaswami et al., 2017</a>). Green buildings substantially reduce energy consumption and also improve indoor environmental quality and thus contribute to mitigation and provide societal value in terms of health (<a class="reference-link" href="#MacNaughton--2018">MacNaughton et al., 2018</a>). In addition, green-roofed buildings contribute to keeping local temperatures cooler during hot days and thereby reducing energy use for air conditioning and thus contributing to both mitigation and adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sharma--2016">Sharma et al., 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation in the energy sector can include changes in production technologies and utilisation of technologies by various industries, changes in consumer or corporate behaviour, and the development of policies that alter the energy sector activities sufficiently to achieve a combination of reduced GHGs emissions and increased benefits for communities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Morand--2015">Morand et al., 2015</a>).

There are also tools to assess uncertainty (e.g., iterative risk management) and to guide decision making under uncertainty over longer time frames (through, e.g., real options analysis, robust decision making involving substantial numbers of scenarios, portfolio analysis and rule-based decision support for uncertainty where maximum regrets are minimised). Use of these tools nevertheless requires human capital and skills, and more commonly they are applied to public rather than private (individual/ household) adaptation decision processes.

Institutional incoherence has led to inefficiency and ineffectiveness (<a class="reference-link" href="#Di%20Gregorio--2017">Di Gregorio et al., 2017</a>). To achieve more coherent institutions and synergies, four major enabling conditions have been identified: (a) planned and/or existing national laws, policies and strategies, (b) existing and planned financial means and measures, (c) institutional arrangements in the country with specific reference to climate change issues and (d) planned and/or existing programmes and initiatives in the country (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kabisch--2016">Kabisch et al., 2016</a>).

This can lead to effective implementation of climate actions and diffusion of climate issues into local sector policies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Reckien--2019">Reckien et al., 2019</a>).

As reviewed by <a class="reference-link" href="#Wiegleb--2018">Wiegleb and Bruns (2018)</a>, early use of the concept was by the World Economic Forum in 2008 where it was emphasised that issues of economic growth need to be considered within water, energy and food resource systems.

UN Water underscores the water–energy–food nexus as central to development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Newell--2019">Newell et al., 2019</a>). It notes that demand for water, food and energy are rising due to a growing population, rapid urbanisation, changing diets and economic growth, and in most cases, the lack of knowledge on the water–energy–food nexus has often led to mismatches in prioritisation and decision making which hinders sustainable development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mitra--2020">Mitra et al., 2020</a>).

Studies utilising the nexus approach to climate change in different places show considerably different results. In the southern African region, climate change is already affecting water–energy–food resources and exerting further pressure on already scarce resources. It is proposed that adaptation can be achieved through cross-sectoral management of resources, by adopting water management practices, aiming to produce more food and energy with less water resources and adopting cleaner and renewable sources of energy. This will result in saving water and ensuring energy security in a region that depends on hydro and coal energy sources (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mpandeli--2018">Mpandeli et al., 2018</a>).

According to the Climate Policy Initiative, adaptation finance is ‘finance with the aim of improving preparation and reducing climate-related risk and damage, for both human and natural systems, as short-term climate impacts will continue to exact economic, social, and environmental costs even if appropriate mitigation actions are taken’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#CPI--2019">CPI, 2019</a>). According to UNEP, the annual costs of adaptation in developing countries could range from USD 140 billion to USD 300 billion by 2030.

Looking only at climate finance flows from developed to developing countries, the OECD estimates a total of USD 78.9 billion mobilised in 2018, with mitigation accounting for 70% (USD 55 billion) of the total, adaptation 21% (USD 16.8 billion) and cross-cutting finance making up the remainder (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2020a">OECD, 2020a</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Adaptation finance funds actions to adapt to the impacts of climate change, yet such actions are heavily context, scale and time specific. Many mitigation actions in the energy sector can be easily quantified and employed across different jurisdictions. For example, solar photovoltaic (PV) presents an established way across a multitude of countries to produce low-carbon energy at a profit and reduce global GHG emissions. Adaptation needs, however, vary greatly from location to location and short-term solutions, for example investments in irrigation technologies to improve water availability for specific crops in a growing season, may differ from longer-term solutions, for example, switching to different crops altogether. Benefits are not always easily quantified and often accrue to local communities over time rather than to investors looking for the kind of returns realised in mitigation actions.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Development finance institutions mainly draw on market-rate loans and, to a lesser extent, concessional lending and grants to finance adaptation actions.

Most green bonds focus on energy, buildings and transport infrastructure but green bond issuance to support sustainable agriculture and forestry has grown from USD 208 million in 2013 to USD 7.4 billion in 2018 (Wilkins, 2019). The Seychelles issued the world’s first ‘blue’ bond in 2018 with the support of the World Bank. Similar to green bonds, blue bonds earmark the use of bond proceeds for specific purposes, here the sustainable use of marine resources (World Bank, 2018). In 2019, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development issued the world’s first ever dedicated climate resilience bond, raising USD 700 million. The 5-year bond will be used to finance the Bank’s projects in climate-resilient infrastructure (e.g., water, energy and transport), climate-resilient business, commercial operations, climate-resilient agriculture and ecological systems (Bennett, 2019). While these issuances are still small compared to the overall green bond market, their rapid growth points to enormous opportunities for ecosystem-based adaptation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Despite the growth of official adaptation funding at international and national levels, for the world’s poorest, adaptation to the impacts and opportunities of climate change frequently occurs in response to L&amp;Ds at the individual or household scale, without coordination at larger institutional scales (<a class="section-link" data-title="Human Vulnerability, Spatial Hotspots, Observed Loss and Damage, and Livelihood Challenges" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.3">Section 8.3</a>, 8.4; <a class="reference-link" href="#Barrett--2014">Barrett, 2014</a>).

In many poor, vulnerable countries, complex governance challenges, such as budget austerity or corruption, hamper the provision of such support. In the absence of adaptation funding for the poor, coordinated at higher scales, the costs of adaptation are borne by the poor at community, kin-group and household scales. Bearing the cost of adaptation, thus, can become, in the short term, an erosive process of coping that ultimately increases the likelihood that communities and households will remain trapped in poverty (<a class="reference-link" href="#Antwi-Agyei--2018b">Antwi-Agyei et al., 2018b</a>). In the long term, measures financing adaptation may be maladaptive, meaning they ultimately leave the poor at greater risk of experiencing climate change impacts (<a class="section-link" data-title="Projected Risks for Livelihoods and Consequences for Equity and Sustainability" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.4.5">Section 8.4.5</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rahman--2019">Rahman and Hickey, 2019</a>).

In general, the antidote to this emerging problem is access to living wages that the poor can rely on to finance adaptation. There are few examples of pro-poor mechanisms, programmes or institutions that prioritise coordinated, access to credit for proactively adapting livelihoods of the poor (<a class="reference-link" href="#Agrawal--2009">Agrawal and Perrin, 2009</a>). Institutions can reduce incentives for vulnerable people to engage in high-risk activities by including them in the process of adaptation governance, which aims not only to support sustainable livelihood practices (such as farming, fishing and forestry), but also to guarantee land tenure (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wrathall--2019">Wrathall et al., 2019</a>).

International governance arrangements, such as the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage, might aim primarily to clear the financing gap between global financial and risk management institutions and the pocketbooks of the poorest (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wrathall--2015">Wrathall et al., 2015</a>).</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="8.7"><h1 class="Headings_H1-numbered" lang="en-GB">8.7 Conclusion </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-8-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The chapter has moved beyond the IPCC WGII AR5 in that it lays out structural elements of vulnerability and provides quantitative information about climate-related vulnerability hotspots globally complemented by the assessment of poverty, local livelihood vulnerability and sustainable development. The assessment of non-economic losses, and enabling and supportive environments for adaptation are also new aspects.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The chapter provides additional evidence on livelihood resources at local levels that have been impacted by different climate hazards and, globally, that specific hazards (namely, drought and rising temperatures) are more threatening and destabilising to livelihoods than others. There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span> that coping and adaptive capacities erode with increasing GMT—substantial differences are expected between a GMT increase of less than 1.5°C compared to an increase of more than 3°C—and the frequencies of climate hazards, such as heat waves, droughts or floods is likely to increase substantially. Nevertheless, this assessment also revealed that the adverse impacts of climate change for livelihoods and multidimensional poverty differ substantially between different population groups exposed to climate hazards, based on the socioeconomic and governance context. Consequently, societal impacts of climate change need to be understood in the broader context of development and the development challenges that influence exposure, vulnerability and adaptation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span> of the impacts of all climate hazards on the key livelihood resources that the poor depend on. There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> that two climate hazards pose high risk to a broad range of livelihood resources: warming trends and droughts. Meanwhile, the livelihood resources that are globally at greatest risk include people’s bodily health, food security and agricultural productivity (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Evidence suggests that the fundamental challenge of climate change to livelihoods is that rising temperatures, drought and other hazards endanger human life, and the lives of plants and animals that humans rely on to survive (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). There is now <span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span> that the impacts of climate change on livelihoods are driving people to migrate in search of alternative incomes, and this tendency will increase with rising temperatures. Of greatest concern are people whose development context is compromised by war, conflict and extreme poverty and inequality, such as refugee populations and displaced people.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This chapter reports quantitative evidence of human vulnerability and therefore identifies various spatial hotspots of vulnerability emerging in regional clusters. It reports that significantly more people are living in highly vulnerable context conditions compared to those living in low vulnerability contexts. The assessment revealed that more than 3 million people are living in countries classified as very highly or highly vulnerable (depending on the assessment method and the number of classes used, and countries included). In contrast, approximately 1.8 billion people reside in low or very low vulnerable country contexts. Studies estimate the population in the most vulnerable regions to almost double by the year 2100 (<a class="section-link" data-title="Future risks, vulnerabilities, differentiated inequalities and livelihood shifts" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.4.5.2">Section 8.4.5.2</a>). When near-term estimates are used, the population growth in highly vulnerable countries is still significantly higher compared to less vulnerable countries. Consequently, this assessment points towards the fact that even if we do not know how societal or community vulnerability will develop in specific areas, it is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>very likely </span> that in the future, more people will live in destabilised and highly vulnerable country contexts compared to the population today. However, it is important to note that the scientific literature also underscores that trends in vulnerability differ significantly between different world regions and within countries.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The chapter also advances knowledge in terms of the interconnections between human vulnerability, observed losses and adverse consequences. The assessment shows that statistically relevant differences in observed fatalities per hazard event can be explained by hazard intensity and frequency, and are also linked to different levels of vulnerability of a region exposed. Despite all uncertainties about future change, the assessed literature clearly provides an accurate picture of the expected societal impacts of climate change, the requirements for successful adaptation and the need to address the adaptation gap from the perspective of vulnerability.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The chapter shows that intersectionality approaches are becoming increasingly central to grasping how differential vulnerability to climate hazards is experienced by different social groups. Intersectionality recognises that age, gender, class, race and ethnicity are reinforcing social phenomena, shaping social inequalities and experiences of the world, and also intersect with climate hazards and vulnerability. Our assessment reveals the central role of maladaptation with <span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust new evidence</span> on negative consequences of interventions on different social groups. Well-intentioned adaptation can exacerbate past and existing vulnerabilities and undermine livelihoods. There is also evidence that, despite maladaptation, inclusive and sustainable development at the local level can reduce vulnerability.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Since AR5 L&amp;D has taken much more central stage in sustainable development, policy, and poverty and livelihoods discourse. While there is ambiguity about what constitutes L&amp;D, the chapter highlights new evidence of observed L&amp;Ds, including slow-onset impacts (e.g., sea level rise and drought). Our assessment reveals that there is a body of literature that explicitly addresses non-economic losses and that these are experienced everywhere now due to human-induced climate change. These are coupled with advancements in the science of extreme event attribution with new focus on adaptation metrics and vulnerability assessments.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This assessment also identifies emerging evidence of linkages between extreme and slow-onset events, NELD and livelihood shifts. This suggests that losses are leading to a range of shifts in livelihoods, which may be easier for some social groups than others, and which have implications for livelihoods security across transboundary scales. Yet, climate change is only one driver. Untangling the drivers of vulnerability using intersectionality approaches is also critical. Our quantification of vulnerability hotspots supports this concern. It is critical to seek further knowledge on the extent of livelihood shifts among the most vulnerable resulting from specific NELD, for whom, where and at what scale. Gaps in knowledge highlight this as an area that needs further work in order to develop and understand further the full extent and reach of the relationships between extreme and slow-onset climate events, non-economic losses and shifting livelihoods.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This chapter builds on AR5 and the IPCC SR 1.5°C on key limits to the adaptation of natural and social systems that are compounded by the effects of poverty and inequality, such as on water scarcity, ecosystems alteration and degradation, coastal cities in relation to sea level rise, cyclones and coastal erosion, food systems and human health (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Climate change risks could have substantial negative impacts on climate-sensitive livelihoods of smallholder farmers, fisheries communities, Indigenous People, urban poor and informal settlements, with limits to adaptation evidenced in the loss income, ecosystems, health and increasing migration (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). The chapter also addresses how ecological thresholds and socioeconomic determinants of vulnerabilities are linked to soft and hard adaptation limits, including the potential and magnitude of livelihood risks in the future. For instance, a hard limit associated with losses of coral reefs in a 1.5°C warmer world will lead to substantial loss of income and livelihoods for coastal communities (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>), including loss of culture- and place-based attachment (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>). Hard adaptation limits are expected for the Arctic ecosystem. Their threshold will affect residents of Arctic regions dependent on hunting and fishing livelihoods (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). New emerging considerations to ecological limits to adaptation, such as severe glacier retreat and Amazon forest dieback, is expected to affect the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and Indigenous People through crop yield failures, biodiversity loss, reduced hydropower capacity and health (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>). While a knowledge gap remains on the projected risks of increasing global temperature to climate-sensitive livelihoods among Global South countries and specific groups of people, current observations show negative impacts to livelihoods for tens to hundreds of millions of people. Thus, without sustainable, equitable and urgent adaptation measures, maladaptation risks are <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> to further increase vulnerability, marginalisation and ecological tipping points among the poor within countries (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span lang="en-US">Evidence on the kinds of enabling environment required paints a complex picture. The assessment highlights the interaction of different capital assets within the broader context of key enablers in shaping the overall enabling environment for adaptation, which itself is highly context dependent. In this regard, countries present different starting points for adaptation, with some requiring, for example, more of an emphasis on institutional capacity building; others requiring transformation to the broader legal and political conditions. Capitals are not necessarily substitutable but rather act as an assemblage in shaping both perceptions of climate risk and the necessity and appropriateness of actions. At the same time there is</span><span class="condensed_italic" lang="en-US">robust evidence</span><span lang="en-US">that livelihoods that depend strongly on natural capital for both subsistence and as a source of income are particularly sensitive to climate risks; and are where perhaps adaptive actions are most urgently needed, even with smaller rises in temperature under the most optimistic scenarios. This applies to both the Global South and the Global North. Investments in any form of capital asset to support adaptation need to be mindful of reinforcing existing inequalities and introducing new ones, particularly if transformation takes place. This also underscores the importance of inclusive, polycentric governance in ensuring the voices of all groups are heard and that wide-ranging knowledge types are incorporated in decision making, nevertheless recognising that trade-offs are inevitable. </span></p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The chapter also highlights and provides quantitative evidence that adaptation strategies need to go beyond the idea of adapting to warming levels only. Adaptation strategies have to reduce the adaptation gap and therewith reduce human vulnerability independent of a specific climatic hazard. It has been shown that adaptation strategies that explicitly address poverty and inequities, and also consider rights-based approaches can generate co-benefits for resilience building of most vulnerable groups and for sustainable development.</p></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="frequently-asked-questions"><h1 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_head" lang="en-US">Frequently Asked Questions </h1><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 8.1"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 8.1 | Why are people who are poor and disadvantaged especially vulnerable to climate change and why do climate change impacts worsen inequality?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-29-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Poor people and their livelihoods are especially vulnerable to climate change because they usually have fewer assets and less access to funding, technologies and political influence. Combined, these constraints mean they have fewer resources to adapt to climate change impacts. Climate change impacts tend to worsen inequalities because they disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups. This in turn further increases their vulnerability to climate change impacts and reduces their ability to cope and recover. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Climate change and related hazards (e.g., droughts, floods, heat stress, etc.) affect many aspects of people’s lives—such as their health, access to food and housing, or their source of income such as crops or fish stocks—and many will have to adapt their way of life in order to deal with these impacts. People who are poor and have few resources with which to adapt are thus much more seriously negatively affected by climate-related hazards. ‘Vulnerability’ is when a person or community is not able to cope and adapt to climate-related hazards. For example, if someone who is very rich has their house washed away in a flood, this is terrible, but they often have more resources to rebuild, have insurances that support recovery and maybe even build a house that is not in a flood-prone area. Whereas for someone who is very poor and who does not live in a state that provides support, the loss of their house in a flood could mean homelessness. This example shows that the same climate hazard (flood) can have a very different impact on people depending on their vulnerability (their capacity to cope and adapt to hazards).</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">It is not just poverty that can make people more vulnerable to climate change and climate-related hazards. Disadvantage due to discrimination, gender and income inequalities and lack of access to resources (e.g., those with disabilities or of minority groups) can mean these groups have fewer resources with which to prepare and react to climate change and to cope with and recover from its adverse effects. They are therefore more vulnerable. This vulnerability can then increase due to climate change impacts in a vicious cycle unless adaptation measures are supported and made possible.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 8.2"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 8.2 | Which world regions are highly vulnerable and how many people live there?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-28-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>A mix of multiple development challenges, such as poverty, hunger, conflict and environmental degradation, make countries and whole regions vulnerable to climate change. Many of the people in the most vulnerable situations and in the most vulnerable regions are also highly exposed to climate hazards, such as droughts, floods or sea level rise at present and will become increasingly so in the future. Studies estimate that around 3.3 to 3.6 billion people are living in regions classified as highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, which is significantly higher than the number of people who reside in regions classified as least vulnerable. The most vulnerable regions include East, Central and West Africa, South Asia, Micronesia and Melanesia, and Central America. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">When a country or region is considered ‘vulnerable’ to climate change this means that climate hazards (e.g., drought, flood, heatwaves) have a very negative impact because there is a high number of people in these areas that lack the ability or opportunity to cope and adapt to such events, due to, for example, high average poverty, inequality and lack of institutional support. This vulnerability could be due to many different development challenges that all come together and influence each other, such as poverty, lack of access to basic infrastructure services, high numbers of uprooted people, state fragility, low or below average life expectancy and biodiversity degradation. These structural social issues often affect regions for many decades and make it difficult for the state and for individuals to respond to climate change and climate-related hazards.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">For example, if a region is already characterised by poverty and struggling to feed its population and provide adequate access to basic infrastructure services, such as water and sanitation, this makes them vulnerable. If this region is then faced with an increased number of extremely dry years, this exposes them to drought and will make things even harder causing more hunger, poverty and worsened health—these are climate impacts.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Most vulnerable regions are in Africa, as well as in South Asia, the Pacific and the Caribbean. In these regions, there are often multiple neighbouring countries that all are highly vulnerable, for example in Central and West Africa. These regional clusters require special attention.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">There are also highly vulnerable groups and individuals within less vulnerable regions. For example, marginalised, disadvantaged and poor minorities within highly affluent cities. Programmes that aim to support adaptation to climate change need to focus on reducing the vulnerability of individuals, groups, countries and regions.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 8.3"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 8.3 | How does and will climate change interact with other global trends (e.g., urbanisation, economic globalisation) and shocks (e.g., COVID-19) to influence livelihoods of the poor?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-30-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>A range of local, regional and global economic and political processes already underway have put the livelihoods of the poor at risk. These processes include urbanisation, industrialisation, technological transformation, monetisation of rural economies, increasing reliance on wages, and inequality at national and international levels. Climate change intersects with these processes. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The world’s poorest already struggle to provide for themselves and their families in their pursuit of livelihoods. Despite hard work there are many factors beyond an individual’s control that can make earning a living very difficult. Climate change is one problem among many that puts stress on livelihoods. Poor and marginal groups disproportionately bear impacts of climate change, in ways that accelerate transitions from traditional livelihoods, such as rural farming, to wage jobs in urban areas. Where adaptation measures are insufficient and where the poor are excluded from decision making, these livelihood transitions can be severely destabilising.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">For example, climate change may alter the frequency or intensity of hazards that threaten the viability of a community’s traditional farming or fishing livelihoods. Local farmers or fishers are then forced to adapt how they farm or fish or abandon livelihood practices entirely. The latter may mean migrating to a city to find work. As many communities face the same challenge, this intersects with a global trend that is affecting billions of lives and livelihoods—urbanisation—as seen in the rapid growth of informal settlements at the peripheries of cities around the world, particularly rapidly growing mega-cities in Africa, Asia and Latin America. These developments will be accelerated by negative impacts of climate change and increase risks that larger segments of the population enter conditions of persistent poverty.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">At the same time, people whose livelihoods have been upended by climate change are subject to new threats, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has shone a light on the plight of the most vulnerable people. For example, the elderly, Indigenous Peoples and Communities of Colour were disproportionately severely impacted by COVID-19; also the indirect economic consequences particularly hit the poor. Hence, COVID-19 demonstrates that the livelihoods of the poorest and most marginalised are vulnerable to other global trends beyond climate change. Also, most severe impacts are expected in regions that are already characterised by high levels of systemic human vulnerability.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 8.4"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 8.4 | What can be done to help reduce the risks from climate change, especially for the poor?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-31-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Public and private investment in different types of assets can help reduce risks from climate change. Exactly which assets require investment depends on the specific situation. However, the provision of access to basic services, such as water and sanitation, education and health care as well as the importance of reducing inequity is shown within the assessment for many regions. The poor have fewer resources to invest, so in poorer countries greater public investment is needed. Legal, social, political, institution and economic interventions can alter human behaviour, though care must be taken that these do not amplify existing inequalities, create new inequalities or reduce future adaptation options. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Adaptation can help to reduce risks for the poor and requires both public and private investment in various natural assets (e.g., mangroves, farmland, wetlands), human assets (e.g., health, skills, Indigenous knowledge), physical assets (e.g., mobile phone connectivity, housing, electricity, technology), financial assets (e.g., savings, credit) and social assets (e.g., social networks, membership of organisations such as farmer cooperatives). Often, the poor have the least to invest, so poverty can reduce adaptation options. Sometimes people migrate as a reaction to floods or droughts, though the poorest groups often lack the resources to move. Exactly what needs investing in to reduce risks varies according to the scale and livelihood system in need of adaptation. In general, risks can be reduced through a range of different technological and engineering approaches (for example, building sea defences to reduce storm surge impacts), as well as ecosystem-based approaches (such as replanting mangroves, altering the types of crops grown, changing the timing of farming activities, or using climate-smart agriculture or agroforestry approaches).</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">At the same time, legal, social, political, institutional and economic solutions can alter human behaviour (e.g., through enforcement of building codes to prevent construction on low-lying land prone to flooding, timely provision of weather information and early warning systems, knowledge-sharing activities, including adaptation strategies grounded in Indigenous knowledge, crop insurance schemes, incentives such as payments to stop people cutting down trees or to enable them to plant them and social protection to provide a safety net in times of crisis).</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The poorest groups often require greater public adaptation investments. Efforts to support adaptation need to be mindful of reinforcing existing inequalities and introducing new ones, making sure they are inclusive, culturally sensitive and that the voices of all groups of people are heard. It is also important that adaptations which reduce immediate risks for the poor do not rule out adaptation options that could help them later on or which could cause them to increase their emissions. Political will is needed to put people at the centre of climate change risk reduction efforts, including support for their livelihoods.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 8.5"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 8.5 | How do present adaptation and future responses to climate change affect poverty and inequality?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-32-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Present adaptation can help to reduce the current and possibly future impacts of climate change.

The livelihood sources of the poor are likely to be affected and cumulative effects of losses and damages, and may influence future poverty. There are cases when present adaptation worsens future poverty and exacerbates inequality—this is called maladaptation. The risks of maladaptation are greater in societies characterised by high inequality, and in many cases the poor and most vulnerable groups are the ones most adversely affected.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Effective decision making in adaptation should be informed by past, present and future climate data, information and scenarios to cater for reliable plans and actions for climate-resilient livelihoods. Adaptation lessons from the past play an important role in decision making regarding responses to climate change. There is an emerging debate on the role of learning, particularly forward-looking (anticipatory) learning, as a key element or important aspect for adaptation and resilience in the context of climate change. Memory, monitoring of key drivers of change, scenario planning and measuring anticipatory capacity are seen as crucial ingredients for future adaptation and resilience pathways, and, hence overcoming maladaptation. Moreover, climate resilient development calls for ensuring synergies between adaptation, mitigation and development are maximised, while trade-offs, especially those affecting the poor, are minimised.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_References_head" lang="en-GB"><span>References</span> </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-9-siblings"><p class="References_References_body" id="Abbott--2004" lang="en-GB">Abbott, D. and S.

The WorldRiskIndex (WRI) conceptualizes vulnerability as having susceptibility, lack of coping capacity and lack of adaptive capacity components. It is based on 28 indicators (23 vulnerability indicators) for 171 countries. It uses different weights based on statistical tools complemented by expert judgements and equal weights for the three components. The index is composed of additive functions for vulnerability <span class="NOTE-TS" lang></span> components (Welle and Birkmann_2015). <span class="NOTE-Intern" lang></span>The INFORM Risk Index conceptualizes vulnerability as having two components namely socioeconomic vulnerability and vulnerable groups while lack of coping capacity is considered as a separate component. The INFORM index consists of 18 indicators to assess vulnerability and 14 indicators for measuring lack of coping capacity. It analyses risk and vulnerability for 191 countries. It uses equal weights for indicators and components and uses a multiplicative function for aggregating components to compose the final index (<a class="reference-link" href="#Marin-Ferrer--2017">Marin-Ferrer et al., 2017</a>). In this chapter, the lack of coping capacity component of INFORM is included in vulnerability calculations in line with the IPCC framing of vulnerability. The vulnerability map presented in this report is based on both WRI and INFORM indices (see <a class="reference-link" href="#Birkmann--2022">Birkmann et al.
