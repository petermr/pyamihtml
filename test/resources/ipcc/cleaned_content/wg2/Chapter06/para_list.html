Projections of the number of people expected to live in urban areas highly exposed to climate change impacts have also increased, exacerbating future risks under a range of climate scenarios.

In AR5, the section on &#8216;human settlements, industry, and infrastructure&#8217; contained three chapters: urban areas; rural areas; and key economic sectors and services. This chapter covers the full range of human settlements: from small settlements in predominantly rural areas, to large metropolises in both high-income and low-income countries. It also assesses evidence of climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation on a range of urban infrastructures, including infrastructure that incorporates socio-economic and ecosystem dimensions (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Terminology and Definitions" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.1.3">Section 6.1.3</a>).</p></li><li><h2>6.1.1_p8</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.1_p8">This assessment also considers new literature about how enabling environments can support adaptation in ways that are also sensitive to Indigenous knowledge and Local knowledge (see below <a class="section-link" data-title="Introduction and Points of Departure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.1">Section 6.1</a>), social justice (6.4.3.4)) and climate mitigation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Building Design and Construction" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3.5.2">Section 6.3.5.2</a>). It builds on the findings of AR5 which highlighted the concentration of global climate risks in urban areas, the complex causal chains that mediate climate impacts for smaller settlements and rural areas, and the multiple issues shaping and influencing economic sectors and infrastructure. This integrated chapter enables a more detailed analysis of the inter-connected drivers of risk that affect urban people and settlements of different sizes. This discussion also highlights the inter-connections within and between urban areas, and between different types of infrastructure and how these complex relationships accentuate or limit the effects of climate change and the institutional structures that play a critical role in mediating and govern these relationships.</p></li><li><h2>6.1.1_p9</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.1_p9">This chapter has five main sections.

Effective municipal governance systems and cooperative multi-level governance supported adaptation action. The AR5 report expressed <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span> that governance interventions can help develop synergies across geographical and institutional scales. Urban areas face challenges of infrastructure investment and maintenance, land use management, livelihood creation and ecosystem services protection. AR5 also considered how urban localities can encourage incremental and transformative adaptation, build resilience and support sustainable development. The assessment identified the need for multi-level and multi-partner action in rapidly growing cities where institutions and infrastructure are still not established to meet the growing demands of the cities. However, there was only <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span> that adaptation action was happening in the AR5 review period.</p></li><li><h2>6.1.2_p2</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.2_p2">The framing of &#8216;key economic sectors and services&#8217; in AR5 focused primarily on three infrastructural areas (energy, water services, transport) and on primary and secondary economic activities (including recreation and tourism, insurance and financial services). Cities, settlements and key infrastructure are also referred to in the IPCC special reports released since AR5. The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC, 2018</a>) examines impacts of global warming on urban systems and infrastructure in the context of advancing sustainable development and eradicating poverty. It highlights the risks facing residents of unplanned and informal urban settlements, many of which are exposed to a range of climate-related hazards (Sections 3.4.8 and 4.4.1.3). The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C also identifies green infrastructure, sustainable land use and planning, and sustainable water management as key adaptation options that can reduce risks in urban areas (SPM C2.4; C2.5), and highlights &#8216;urban and infrastructure&#8217; as one of four system transitions required to limit warming to 1.5&#176;C to create an enabling environment for adaptation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Observed Impacts on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH)" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.3.3">Section 4.3.3</a>). Innovative governance arrangements that go beyond formal &#8216;government&#8217; and political arrangements and that include non-state actors, networks and informal institutions were identified as important in addressing climate change and implementing responses to 1.5&#176;C-consistent pathways (Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C [Sections 4.4.1 and 5.6.2]). In addition, the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C mentions, with <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>, the climate-related health effects of urban heat islands, urban heatwaves and increasing risks from some vector-borne diseases (illnesses caused by pathogens and parasites in human populations) (SPM B5.2). The report also notes both trade-offs and important co-benefits of sustainable development in pursuit of climate resilient development pathways that achieve ambitious mitigation and adaptation in conjunction with poverty eradication and efforts to reduce inequalities (SPM D6).</p></li><li><h2>6.1.2_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.2_p3">The Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere (SROCC) similarly emphasizes the role governance plays in reducing disaster risk, through planning, and zoning (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>). It identifies vulnerability factors such as poverty, which can undermine resilience and sustainable development in urban communities (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a> SPM C3.1,and <a class="section-link" data-title="Hazards and Exposure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.3">Section 2.3.2</a>) The SROCC report shows that the emerging climate-related challenges are impacting the accessibility and availability of vital resources and blurring the public and private boundaries of risk and responsibility (Cross-Chapter Box 3). According to the SROCC report, new governance arrangements are emerging to address these challenges, including participatory and networked structures, and institutions linking formal and informal networks involving state, private sector, Indigenous and civil society actors (Cross-Chapter Box 3). The SROCC report calls for place-specific action because there is no single climate governance panacea for the ocean, coasts and cryosphere (Cross-Chapter Box 3). The SROCC report highlights evidence of the importance of inclusivity, fairness, deliberation, reflexivity, responsiveness, social learning, the co-production of knowledge, and respect for ethical and cultural diversity in climate-related urban decision making (Cross-Chapter Box 3). In addition, the Special Report on Climate Change and Land notes that urbanisation can intensify extreme rainfall events over the city or downwind of urban areas and have can significant consequences for heat island effects on loss of food production, posing additional risks to the food system (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a> SPM A5.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2).</p></li><li><h2>6.1.3_p2</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.3_p2">Definitions of &#8216;urban&#8217; have become more nuanced since the AR5 review with the publication of the OECD report &#8216;A new perspective on urbanisation&#8217; (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD%20and%20European%20Commission--2020">OECD and European Commission, 2020</a>). This report presents two new global definitions of urbanisation reflecting the degree of urbanisation on a continuum of cities, towns and semi-dense areas, and rural areas. The OECD estimates almost half the world&#8217;s population (48%) live in cities, while just 24% live in rural areas and 28% live in towns and semi-dense areas (28%). In addition, the OECD report defines metropolitan areas as functional urban areas together with their surrounding commuting zones &#8216;to capture the full extent&#8217; of a city&#8217;s working population. Metropolitan areas account for 54% of total world population, with the OECD estimating that commuting zones representing 17% of the overall metropolitan population, rising to 31% in high-income countries. In the context of these global definitions, this chapter identifies &#8216;cities and settlements&#8217; as concentrated human habitation centres (along a dynamic continuum from rural to urban) (Murali <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ward--2016">Ward and Shackleton, 2016</a>) (Figure 6.1) that are fundamentally inter-connected to other urban centres and rural areas as nodes within broader networks.</p></li><li><h2>6.1.3_p4</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.3_p4">Key infrastructure is used here to refer to &#8216;critical nodes and arteries&#8217; that comprise urban energy, food, water, sewerage, health, transport and communication systems (<a class="reference-link" href="#Steele--2017">Steele and Legacy, 2017</a>; Maxwell <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Bassolas <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Key or critical infrastructure provides much of the material basis of cities and settlements, as well as the mechanisms for enabling flows of people, goods, data, waste, energy (through urban metabolism processes of consumption and production) and capital, between urban regions and rural areas (Blay-Palmer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Dijst <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). An overview of this process of &#8216;planetary&#8217; urbanisation is provided in Box 6.1. The balance of accumulated scientific knowledge on climate risks, impact and adaptation has been generated from studies in large and medium-sized cities of 1 million or more. While these larger cities continue to grow rapidly (UNDESA 2018), settlements of more than 5 million people contain less than a quarter of the world&#8217;s urban population, and more than half of the world&#8217;s urban residents live in settlements of 1 million or less (Table 6.1). There is a key gap in knowledge, especially concerning urban enabling environments and how smaller settlements can be supported to accelerate equitable and sustainable adaptation in the face of financial and governance constraints (Birkmann <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Shi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dulal--2019">Dulal, 2019</a>; Rosenzweig <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b).</p></li><li><h2>6.1.3_p5</h2><p class="Body_Tables_Table_title" lang="en-US" id="6.1.3_p5"><span class="table_number" lang>Table 6.1 | </span>Proportion of the urban population in different size class urban areas (UN-DESA 2018).

Social infrastructure includes the social, cultural, and financial activities and institutions, as well as associated property, buildings and artefacts and policy domains such as social protection, health and education that support well-being and public life (Frolova <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Latham--2019">Latham and Layton, 2019</a>). Nature-based infrastructure focuses on solutions to risk, applying natural assets such as trees or open water, physical infrastructure describes engineering approaches and grey/physical infrastructure refers to engineered assets that provide one or multiple services required by society, such as transportation or wastewater treatment ([IISD, N.D.]; see also Annex II: Glossary).</p></li><li><h2>6.1.3_p8</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.3_p8">This approach is based on a framing of cities and settlements as complex systems where social, ecological and physical processes interact in planned and unplanned ways. This chapter therefore builds on the AR5 <a class="section-link" data-title="Asia" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-10">Chapter 10</a> (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arent--2014">Arent et al., 2014</a>) conception of key economic sectors and services (e.g., energy, water, transport, waste, sanitation and drainage) by positioning these within three major categories of infrastructure: social, nature based and physical (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Pathways" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3">Section 6.3</a>). Where adaptation challenges can be responded to by more than one approach, sometimes working together, this is noted (see also Sections 17.2 and 17.4). This approach allows an understanding of adaptation that is not constrained to the administrative boundaries of cities and settlements, but that includes the networks and flows that connect peri-urban communities, metropolitan regions, suburban settlements and more rural places (see Box 6.1). Both formal provision of infrastructure services by government and informal provision by communities and individuals are considered at risk from climate change, as are existing adaptation pathways and actions.</p></li><li><h2>6.1.3_p9</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.3_p9">Cities are complex entities where social, ecological and physical systems interact in planned and unplanned ways (Markolf <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). The complexity of cities, settlements and key infrastructure (Figure 6.2) where multiple functional systems continuously interact makes it difficult to distinguish risks (Box 6.1). The literature often resolves this by offering discrete assessments for specific sectors (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Pathways" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3">Section 6.3</a>). This fragmented approach to understanding climate change associated impacts and risks is then reflected also in siloed approaches to risk management and adaptation financing (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>). Recent literature notes that resilience planning has begun to overcome this tendency by presenting climate change impacts, losses and damages, and urban processes, as unfolding together in interacting and cascading pathways (Fraser <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Eriksen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020) (Figure 6.2). The chapter reflects this change in the literature by presenting climate change impacts through a series of risk assessments, including by hazard type, through indirect impacts on health or food security, key infrastructure systems, land use and human mobility, water flows and on structural conditions, such as poverty and justice in the city (see Sections 6.3 and 6.4). In a departure from AR5 we also consider the consequential interactions of climate risks, impacts, adaptation and climate mitigation (see also Cross-Working Group Box URBAN in Chapter 6).</p></li><li><h2>6.1.3_p11</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.3_p11">The IPCC 1.5&#176;C Special Report commented that &#8216;The extent of risk depends on human vulnerability and the effectiveness of adaptation for regions (coastal and non-coastal), informal settlements, and infrastructure sectors (energy, water, and transport) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>)&#8217; (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018">IPCC, 2018</a>).We take this statement as a starting point for assessing the risks to cities, settlements and key infrastructure, with infrastructure extended as noted above. Risks from climate change are understood as the product of climate change associated hazards impacting on exposed and vulnerable people and assets (including biodiversity). Adaptation can, in some cases, reduce exposure and susceptibility and enable recovery and scope for transformation toward long-term equitable and sustainable development. Risks describe both present conditions and future prospects. Direct attribution of hazards to climate change remains limited to temperature extremes and sea level rise, though we consider all hydrometeorological hazards as systems associated with climate change processes.</p></li><li><h2>6.1.3_p12</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.3_p12">This chapter also assesses conditions supporting incremental and transformative adaptation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>). Incremental and transformative adaptation are both important but serve distinct roles in the interaction of urban systems, climate risk and risk management, and in advancing social justice, just transitions and climate resilient development (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>). Climate resilient development pathways are an emerging concept in the literature since the AR5 (Schipper <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Climate resilient development is an iterative process of systemic change that integrates both mitigation and adaptation efforts (see Annex II: Glossary). Initial studies highlight the way rapid urbanisation and precarious urban housing and land tenure can undermine climate resilient development, while human settlements that are managed to protect housing tenancy and land tenure rights can advance land use planning and social learning while reducing inequalities and vulnerability and enhancing resilient development (Mitchell, Enemark and Van der Molen, 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bellinson--2019">Bellinson and Chu, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#%C3%9Crge-Vorsatz--2018">&#220;rge-Vorsatz et al., 2018</a>).

How households engage with communities and neighbourhoods and larger units within cities, and how cities (both formal and informal) interact with sub-national and national actors is also discussed, as is the role of finance and community-based organisations (CBOs)/NGOs in the governance process.</p></li><li><h2>6.1.4_p1</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.4_p1">Since AR5, many cities and other settlements, particularly unplanned and/or informal in Asia and Africa, have continued to grow at rapid rates (van den Berg , Otto and Fikresilassie 2021). Elsewhere, in Latin America in particular, while growth is less rapid, inequality persists.

The 2012 data used in AR5 projected a global urban population of 4984 million in 2030 and 6252 million in 2050; the 2018 revisions project 5167 million and 6680 million respectively. Particularly noteworthy is the higher projection provided for sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s urban population: increasing from 596 million to 666 million in 2030, and from 1069 million to 1258 million in 2050. These figures highlight the continued trend toward larger urban populations, and the particular significance of this in areas which currently have relatively small proportions of their populations living in towns and cities; this is also true in some Small Island States (e.g., the Solomon Islands) (McEvoy <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). The proportion of the global urban population living in megacities (with populations of more than 10 million people) is expected to continue growing slowly (to 16% of the urban total, or 862 million people, living in 48 agglomerations) by 2035 (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNDESA--2018">UNDESA, 2018</a>). The size and form of these megacities presents particular challenges with climate change impacts, in areas including air quality (Baklanov, Luisa and Molina, 2016), flooding (Januriyadi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018), and temperature increase (Darmanto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019) (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Differentiated Human Vulnerability" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2.3">Section 6.2.3</a>).</p></li><li><h2>6.1.4_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.4_p3">While there are few analyses of urban trends at the global scale, an additional 2.5 billion people are projected to be living in urban areas by 2050, with up to 90% of this increase concentrated in the regions of Asia and Africa, particularly in India, China and Nigeria, where 35% of this urban growth is projected to occur (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNDESA--2018">UNDESA, 2018</a>). Growth rates are slowing down in North America, South America and Europe (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNDESA--2018">UNDESA, 2018</a>). Much global growth continues to outstrip the ability of governments or the private sector to plan, fund and provide for sustainable urban infrastructure and this is most marked in low-income and informal settlements (Angel <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Rural migration as a driver of urbanisation is discussed in 6.2.4.3, and literature has documented the way urban expansion and the conversion of agricultural land is also driven by investment incentives and weak planning policies (Colsaet, Laurans and Levrel, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Woodworth--2017">Woodworth and Wallace, 2017</a>). At the same time, early evidence suggests that, at least in some locations, out-migration from cities occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (Rajan, Sivakumar and Srinivasan, 2020), but the evidence is not clear and in some cases may have increased migration to other megacities (Chow <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). There is also growing recognition that poor planning has exacerbated the concentrated of deprivation in specific locations, deepening a cycle of exclusion and marginalisation (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNDESA--2020">UNDESA, 2020</a>).</p></li><li><h2>6.1.4_p4</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.4_p4">One critical element of global urban trends which has received growing attention is informality (see also Prieur-Richard, Walsh and Craig, 2019). Informality is one of the key defining features of cities and settlements in the Global South (see Annex II: Glossary; Banks, Lombard and Mitlin, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Myers--2021">Myers, 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UN-Habitat--2016c">UN-Habitat, 2016c</a>). In almost all nations in the Global South, more than half the urban workforce work in informal employment; the proportions are particularly high in South Asia (82% in informal employment) and sub-Saharan Africa (66%) (Chen, Roever and Skinner, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2014">Chen, 2014</a>). The term &#8216;informal settlement&#8217; refers to urban settlements or neighbourhoods that developed outside the formal system that is meant to record land ownership and tenure and without meeting a range of regulations relating to planning and land use, built structures and health and safety. Informality is a broader concept than &#8216;slums&#8217;, which are usually defined using measures of housing quality, provision of services and overcrowding. While most countries do not generate formal statistics on the number of people living in informal settlements, UN Habitat provides regional and global estimates of the number of urban households that are &#8216;slum&#8217; households and therefore likely to include most residents of informal settlements. These estimates suggest that there were 1034 million slum dwellers in 2018, including some 56% of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa and more than 30% of the urban population of South Asia (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN-Habitat--2020">UN-Habitat, 2020</a>). Informality is particularly important in understanding climate risks and responses in cities and settlements, and also in relation to key infrastructure (<a class="reference-link" href="#Trundle--2020">Trundle, 2020</a>; Taylor <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021).</p></li><li><h2>6.1.4_p5</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.1.4_p5">Evidence since AR5 confirms that occupants of informal settlements are particularly exposed to climate events given low-quality housing, limited capacity to adapt, and limited or no risk-reducing infrastructure (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Melore--2020">Melore and Nel, 2020</a>; Twinomuhangi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; Satterthwaite <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Patel <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020a)(see <a class="section-link" data-title="Impacts and Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2">Section 6.2</a> and case study).

Indigenous and local knowledge inform coping strategies in urban adaptation planning and new directions for action (Nakashima, Krupnik and Rubis, 2018; Abudu Kasei, Dalitso Kalanda-Joshua and Tutu Benefor, 2019). Indigenous and local knowledge is also found to shape perceptions about urban climate risk awareness, its acceptable limits, causation and preferences for adaptation (see also Pyh&#228;l&#228;<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016 for a review; see Jaakkola, Juntunen and N&#228;kk&#228;l&#228;j&#228;rvi, 2018 for impacts on Indigenous peoples in the EU; Saboohi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Local perceptions about climate change in turn influence adaptation behaviours in settlements and urban communities (Lee <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Larcom, She and van Gevelt, 2019). Engagement with Indigenous and local knowledge is an enabling condition for planning community-appropriate climate adaptation responses (Fern&#225;ndez-Llamazares <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Urban decision making that includes Indigenous and local knowledge has co-benefits for addressing indigenous dispossession, historical inequities and marginalisation of indigenous values that occurred (Parsons <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Carter--2019">Carter, 2019</a>; Maldonado <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Orlove <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Pearce <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Indigenous and local knowledge can help deliver culturally appropriate strategies and local choices for urban risk management through, for example community-based observation networks (Alessa <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016), integrating ecosystem-based adaptation strategies in institutional structures (Nalau <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018), using multiple evidence-based approaches (Teng&#246;<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014), and adopting forms of governance that centre Indigenous peoples in urban adaptation and decision making (<a class="reference-link" href="#Horn--2018">Horn, 2018</a>; Parsons, Fisher and Nalau, 2016).</p></li><li><h2>box-6.1_p1</h2><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-6.1_p1">The scale, reach and complexity of contemporary urbanisation compounds climate risks and conditions adaptation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Miller--2017">Miller and Hutchins, 2017</a>; Rosenzweig <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b).

Moreover, the urban and rural differentiation creates normative expectations at the heart of planning conflicts and constraints of urban governance (Taylor, Butt and Amati, 2017). Expanding peri-urban areas pose specific structural constraints to addressing risks. In Bogot&#225;, Colombia, a study found marked inequalities as more impoverished families had restricted access to peri-urban forests, trees and tree services (Escobedo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Factors such as limited land ownership and tenure insecurity in peri-urban areas hinder people&#8217;s ability to invest in permanent infrastructure to buffer themselves from flood events, as witnessed in the slums in Nairobi (Thorn, Thornton and Helfgott, 2015).

Climate change already interacts with ongoing global trends in urbanisation to create regionally specific impacts and risk profiles. Through demographic change and encroachment into natural and agricultural lands and coastal zones, rapidly expanding urban settlements can place new physical assets and people in locations with high exposure (Tessler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Arnell--2016">Arnell and Gosling, 2016</a>; Kundzewicz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). Increasing rates of global urbanisation will pose additional challenges to areas that have high levels of poverty, unemployment, informality, and housing and service backlogs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jiang--2017">Jiang and O&#8217;Neill, 2017</a>; Williams <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). There is some evidence to suggest that climate change impacts themselves are increasing urbanisation rates, generating a challenging feedback loop. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, manufacturing towns have experienced growth because of population movement following droughts in agricultural hinterlands (Henderson, Storeygard and Deichmann, 2017). The rapid rate of urbanisation therefore presents a time-limited opportunity to work toward risk reduction and transformational adaptation in towns and cities. The following sections explore these dynamic interactions between urban systems and climate change, and how these shape risk for people and for key infrastructures.</p></li><li><h2>6.2.1_p2</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.2.1_p2">Examining projected climate change impacts and resulting risks in cities, settlements and key infrastructures requires the prerequisite development of scenarios which are plausible descriptions of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces, (e.g., rate of technological change, prices and relationships) and pathways <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> or the temporal evolution of natural and/or human systems, such as demographic and urban land cover change, toward a future state or states (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gao--2020">Gao and O&#8217;Neill, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gao--2019">Gao and O&#8217;Neill, 2019</a>; see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Changes in the Global Enabling Environment" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.1.5">Section 6.1.5</a>).</p></li><li><h2>6.2.1_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.2.1_p3">Climate change research creates scenarios integrating emissions and development pathways dimensions (Ebi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; van Vuuren <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017b; van Vuuren <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017a) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (Riahi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). For risk reduction at regional scales, scenarios require urban-relevant climate projections, for example, downscaling from global and regional climate models of variables such as temperature, precipitation, air pollutants and sea level rise that are analysed usually for mid- or end-21st Century timeframes (e.g., Mika <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Kusaka <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Masson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014b). These data are needed to ascertain likely ranges of climate change impacts within city and settlement boundaries, and to quantify physical exposure when developing pathways for risk reduction. Consideration of current and projected future growth pathways of multiple urban sectors and key infrastructure, for example, transport, energy and buildings, are also needed to estimate probabilities of risk outcomes and damages within and across urban systems (O&#8217;Neill <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015)(WGIII AR6 Section 8).</p></li><li><h2>6.2.1_p4</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.2.1_p4">The challenges of managing these risks are amplified by the complex interactions between climate and urban scenarios, owing to the smaller spatial&#8211;temporal scales of urban areas in climate change modelling relative to global climate models (GCM) and shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP); geographical or geomorphological variations in city location; uncertainties arising from incomplete assumptions about socio-economic pathways at urban scales affecting urban demographics, for example, fertility rates and life expectancies or increased rural&#8211;urban migration; and challenges in modelling the urban climate and in developing urban climate observational networks in cities (WGI Box 10.3; Kamei, Hanaki and Kurisu, 2016; Yu, Jiang and Zhai, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jiang--2017">Jiang and O&#8217;Neill, 2017</a>; Baklanov <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).

Assessing the inter-relationships between multiple systems and a range of hazards is particularly important as many cities are presently exposed to multiple climate-related hazards: more than 100 cities analysed as part of a 571 city study in Europe were deemed vulnerable to two or more climate impacts (Guerreiro <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).

The data assessed in this section are limited by uneven coverage. Despite improvements since AR5, data continue to be more complete for extreme events than for chronic hazards and everyday risks, which may have high aggregate impacts and disproportionately erode the well-being of urban poor households, especially for the most vulnerable, including women, children, the aged, disabled and homeless (van Wesenbeeck, Sonneveld and Voortman, 2016; Kinay <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Connelly <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Data coverage is also less comprehensive for smaller settlements in poorer countries, the locations where urban growth is often high and adaptive capacities are often low (e.g., Rufat <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Thus, data gaps frequently coincide with highly vulnerable populations (Rufat <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Satterthwaite--2017">Satterthwaite and Bartlett, 2017</a>).

There are implications also for adaptation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Pathways" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3">Section 6.3</a>), where the greater availability of evidence on exposure-driven risk can limit resilience-building interventions that focus on the reduction of vulnerability.</p></li><li><h2>6.2.2.1_p1</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.2.2.1_p1">Higher temperatures associated with climate change, through warmer global average temperatures and regional heatwave episodes, will interact with urban systems in a variety of ways (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021 Box 10.3).

Coastal flooding associated with sea level rise is exacerbated due to the significant number of people living in subsiding areas.

The increase in flood risk from urban development can be considerable; based on modelling of two RCP (4.5 and 8.5) scenarios, Kaspersen et al. (2017) noted flooding in four European cities could increase by up to 10% for every 1% increase in impervious surface area. Risks are also compounded by the location of settlements, with greater risks within cities located in low elevation coastal zones subject to sea level rise, potential land subsidence and exposure to tropical cyclones ((<a class="reference-link" href="#Koop--2017">Koop and van Leeuwen, 2017</a>; Hoegh-Guldberg <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; see also Section <a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Change Risks to Cities and Settlements by the Sea" href="/chapter/6#CCP2.2">CCP2.2</a>) and within informal settlements, where generally little investment in drainage solutions exists and flooding regularly disrupts livelihoods and disproportionately undermines local food safety and security for the urban poor (Dodman, Colenbrander and Archer, 2017; Dodman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Kundzewicz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Sections 5.4 and 5.8).</p></li><li><h2>6.2.2.2_p4</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.2.2.2_p4">Future risks of urban flooding is increasing in conjunction with continued increases in global surface temperature (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>; Winsemius <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kulp--2019">Kulp and Strauss, 2019</a>; Hoegh-Guldberg <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). In particular, Asian cities are highly exposed to future flood risks arising from urbanisation processes. Between 2000 and 2030, rapid urbanisation in Indonesia will elevate flood risks by 76&#8211;120% for river and coastal floods, while sea level rise will further increase the exposure by 19&#8211;37% (Muis <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015).

Flooding in urban areas is exacerbated both by the encroachment of urban areas into areas that retain water and by the lack of infrastructure such as embankments and flood walls, as is the case for large areas of Dhaka East (Haque, Bithell and Richards, 2020). <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhou--2019">Zhou et al.

The economic risks associated with future surface water flooding in towns and cities are considerable. For example in the UK, expected annual damages from surface water flooding may increase by &#163;60&#8211;200 million for projected 2&#8211;4&#176;C warming scenarios; enhanced adaptation actions could manage flooding up to a 2&#176;C scenario but will be insufficient beyond that (Sayers <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Analyses conducted in South Korea suggests that future flood levels could exceed current flood protection design standards by as much as 70% by 2100, considerably increasing urban flood risk (Kang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Modelling of urban flood damage in the Kelani River Basin in Sri Lanka showed increased frequency of flooding by 2030 could increase potential urban property damage by up to 10.2% (Komolafe Akinola, Herath and Avtar, 2018). Urban flood impacts may also exacerbate health burdens (including disease outbreaks of malaria, typhoid and cholera), which are compounded by damage to medical facilities (e.g., damage to hospitals and disruption of medicinal supply chains), as observed in urban areas of Ghana (Gough <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).

Climate change, as a push factor, is only one among multiple drivers (political, economic and social) related to environmental migration (Heslin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pl%C3%A4nitz--2019">Pl&#228;nitz, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Luetz--2019">Luetz and Merson, 2019</a>). There is consensus that it is difficult to pin climate change as the sole driver of internal (within national boundaries) rural to urban migration decisions owing to, among other factors, the disconnect between national and international policies (Wilkinson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016), the lack of unifying theoretical frameworks and the complex interactions between climatic and other drivers (social, demographic, economic and political) at multiple scales (Cattaneo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Borderon <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Environmental migration, including rural to urban migration, triggered by climate change may ensue from either slow- or rapid-onset climatic events and could be either temporary, cyclical or permanent movement that occurs within or beyond national boundaries (Heslin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Silja--2017">Silja, 2017</a>).</p></li><li><h2>6.2.3.3_p2</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.2.3.3_p2">A range of specific studies highlight certain elements of vulnerability and migration, including the ways in which slow-onset events affect precarious, resource-dependent livelihoods (such as farming and fisheries) (Cai <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016).

This aligns with other findings that a consistent increase in temperature between 2&#176;C and 4&#176;C in some parts of the world renders involuntary, forced migration inevitable (Otto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017).</p></li><li><h2>6.2.3.3_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.2.3.3_p3">The complexity of migration drivers (as push or pull factors) explains why there is little agreement around quantitative estimates on migration (especially international) triggered by climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Silja--2017">Silja, 2017</a>; Otto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), and why estimates of future displacement attributed to climate change and other environmental causes vary between 25 million and 1 billion in 2050 (Heslin <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).

These tensions can become acute in fragile and conflict affected states (see Box 6.3). It is important to differentiate between the climatic drivers of risk and social drivers that may compound risk exposures and experiences (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brown--2014">Brown, 2014</a>; Nightingale <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020), especially since technically- and scientifically-informed adaptation actions can be redirected depending on socioeconomic, political or cultural conditions on the ground (Eriksen, Nightingale and Eakin, 2015). The implementation of adaptation, whether by government, private sector or civil society actors, can therefore lead to unanticipated and unintended amplification of political, economic and ecological risks (Swatuk <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Many cities are still in the phase of piloting or testing out appropriate adaptation actions, although there is emerging consensus that adaptation plans and projects should acknowledge trade-offs, intentionally avoid past development mistakes, not lock-in detrimental impacts or further risks arising from implementation and explicitly anticipate the risks of maladaptation in decision making (Magnan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Gajjar, Singh and Deshpande, 2019). Maladaptation describes actions that lead to increased vulnerability or risk to climate impacts or diminish welfare. Urban examples include green gentrification which offers nature-based solutions to the few, social safety nets that promote risk inducing subsidies. Whether an action is maladapted can depend on context, for example air conditioning can reduce risk for the individual but is maladaptive at a societal level (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Air Quality Regulation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3.4.2">Section 6.3.4.2</a>).

Climate resilient development raises the ambition for adaptation actions so that it is also possible to describe actions that do not also enhance climate mitigation and sustainable development outcomes as maladaptive (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Delivers on the Needs of the Most Vulnerable" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.3.1">Section 6.4.3.1</a>).

In cities and settlements, adaptation interventions can displace ecological impacts to more vulnerable areas or directly lead to socioeconomically exclusionary outcomes (Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016), particularly when adaptation plans and actions are primarily assessed through the prism of economic and/or financial viability (Shi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Klein, Juhola and Landauer, 2017). As a result, adaptation actions make only minimal contributions to the reduction of vulnerability, as the increased vulnerability of excluded communities more than offsets the decreased vulnerability of more well-off communities.

Mandates to mainstream adaptation into existing development logics and structures perpetuates development-as-usual, reinforcing technocratic forms of local governance and locking in structural causes of marginalisation and differential vulnerability (Scoville-Simonds, Jamali and Hufty, 2020). Adaptation policy examples include: Australia&#8217;s adaptation policy focus on financial strategies, preference for business-as-usual scenarios and incremental change will not contribute to transformative change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Granberg--2014">Granberg and Glover, 2014</a>); Surat, India, where a focus on adapting industries and economically important assets in the city can divert policy attention away from general social equity and urban sustainability priorities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chu--2016">Chu, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Blok--2020">Blok, 2020</a>); Cambodia, where conflict between adaptation practitioners and local communities and non-compliance with regulatory safeguards led to conflict and potential for maladaptation (Work <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Finally, although insurance has the potential to incentivise practices to reduce risks, including through measures to reduce premiums (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Financing Adaptation in Cities, Settlements and Infrastructures" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.5">Section 6.4.5</a> for additional details), researchers of insurance-led adaptation actions have argued that, since insurance regimes privilege normality, they tend to structurally embed risky behaviour and inhibit change (O&#8217;Hare, White and Connelly, 2016). All of these examples illustrate how incremental strategies that rely on business-as-usual actions can further entrench unequal and unsustainable development patterns in the long term. There are also significant limits to urban adaptation (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>) with consequential impacts on human well-being.</p></li><li><h2>6.2.6_p6</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.2.6_p6">Table 6.4 lists a selection of key risks (broadly defined as have severe outcomes common to a majority of cities) identified in our assessment of urban impacts and risks in this section.

It also provides adaptation options identified and elaborated on in <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Pathways" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3">Section 6.3</a> as having the highest potential for reducing the risk, and an assessment of the confidence in the judgement that this risk could become severe.

Individual adaptation actions co-evolve with risks (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Impacts and Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2">Section 6.2</a>) and development processes (<a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a>) to compose more or less planned adaptation pathways that can include a range of unanticipated outcomes. This section engages with this complexity by approaching adaptation through the notion of infrastructure. The adaptation options for individual infrastructure systems are reviewed, and in <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a> brought together through assessment of cross-cutting enabling conditions. Interpreted broadly, infrastructure includes the social systems, ecological systems and grey/physical systems that underpin safe, satisfying and productive life in the city and beyond (Grimm <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Social infrastructure includes housing, health, education, livelihoods and social safety nets, cultural heritage/institutions, disaster risk management and security and urban planning. Ecological infrastructure includes nature-based services: temperature regulation, flood protection and urban agriculture. Grey, or physical infrastructure, includes energy, transport, water and sanitation, communications (digital), built form and solid waste management. Framing infrastructure in this way enables an assessment of adaptation that is not constrained to the administrative boundaries of urban settlements, but also includes the flows of material, people and money between urban, peri-urban and more rural places, and can include adaptation actions deployed by government, individuals and the private sector. Recognising the complexity of adaptation and the research literature that reaches beyond individual infrastructural domains, the section also reviews urban adaptation through the cross-cutting lenses of equity and mitigation. <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling Conditions for Adaptation Action in Urban Areas, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4">Section 6.4</a> assesses the enabling environment (political will, governance, knowledge, finance and social context) that shapes specific adaptation contexts and futures.</p></li><li><h2>6.3.2_p1</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.2_p1">The adaptation gap is the difference between the ability to manage risk and loss and experienced risk and loss (Chen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2021">UNEP, 2021</a>). It describes both levels of capacity and residual risk. Figure 6.4 presents an analysis by IPCC World Region for urban populations and current levels for risk and loss. The analysis seeks to draw out equity considerations by comparing the poorest and wealthiest quintiles for each region and for adaptation to the direct impacts of flooding and heatwave, as well as impacts felt in cities that include climate change impacts on supply chains; water and food security.

Even if <span class="condensed_italic" lang>all conceivabl</span> e adaptation was to be deployed, the majority of risks faced by the urban rich and poor today would not be fully resolved.

Protection entails, in addition to allocating zones for protective urban infrastructure (such as seawalls, levees and dykes, and slope revetments), avoidance measures that restrict or prevent urban development (e.g., through growth containment and/or no-build zones). Accommodation involves land use modifications and/or conversions while retreat requires either compulsory or voluntary relocations and may entail buyouts (Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Le%C3%B3n--2016">Le&#243;n and March, 2016</a>; Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018).

The imposition of planning-based tools such as scenario planning, flexible zoning and development incentivisation (among others) has the capacity to influence and encourage these adaptations (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2017). Local risk-reduction inputs can inform land use adaptation policies (accommodation and/or avoidance, specifically growth containment and no-build zones) that are better integrated within larger urban plans (Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nalau--2018">Nalau and Becken, 2018</a>; Tsuda and Duarte, 2018) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.3.1_p5</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.3.1_p5">Implementation of zoning and land use measures for climate adaptation from cities across diverse contexts remains limited (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span>) owing to a range of challenges.

In such contexts, early warning services vary in effectiveness within the same urban centre (Allen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020c; Rangwala <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Often, forecast-based action follows linear structures where forecast information is applied mainly for responding to negative impacts rather than anticipatory decision-making and preparation to avoid such impacts (Marchezini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Early warning systems are effective for warning of threshold breaching events including cyclonic activity and riverine flooding but less able to provide localised warning, though capability is rapidly increasing. Probabilistic risk forecasting and forecast based early action are only beginning to be applied to urban contexts and often those that are most vulnerable do not receive warnings regarding hazardous events (Nissan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). There is less capacity for early warning systems in LMICs with key challenges linked to a lack of well-established risk baseline information; accessibility, communication and understanding of forecast information, as well as political and institutional barriers and limited resources and capacities to act on such information (Jones <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Mustafa <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zia--2015">Zia and Wagner, 2015</a>; Marchezini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Gotgelf, Roggero and Eisenack, 2020). Political and institutional barriers to the incorporation of climate information to decision-making are not limited to LMICs (Harvey <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). For example, comprehensive studies on sectoral use of climate information in Europe revealed that, despite climate services becoming increasingly accessible and well resourced, there is limited organisational uptake of seasonal climate forecasts across key sectors (e.g., energy, transport, water and infrastructure) in informing their decision making processes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Soares--2016">Soares and Dessai, 2016</a>; Soares, Alexander and Dessai, 2018). This is due both to technical and non-technical barriers such as lack of awareness and knowledge of climate information and forecasting (<a class="reference-link" href="#Soares--2016">Soares and Dessai, 2016</a>; Soares, Alexander and Dessai, 2018).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.3.3_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.3.3_p3">Globally, a considerable diversity of tools and frameworks for urban resilience assessments are being developed at multiple scales (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arup%20and%20Rockefeller--2015">Arup and Rockefeller, 2015</a>; Elias-Trostmann <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). These include hybrids such as ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) (Begum <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014).While important advances have been made in assessing urban resilience, much debate remains around such tools and assessment approaches regarding issues such as validation, dynamics in exposure and vulnerability, and appropriateness of generic methods in high-density urban settlements (Leitner <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Cardoso <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Rufat <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).

The study by <a class="reference-link" href="#Moghadas--2019">Moghadas et al.

A growing literature shows how multidisciplinary and inclusive approaches that include Local knowledge can achieve greater accuracy in risk characterisation and support lasting impact of investments into more robust climate services (Aerts <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Louren&#231;o <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Sword-Daniels <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Singh <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Nissan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Harvey <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Simon--2020">Simon and Palmer, 2020</a>).

Established non-state actors such as Shack and Slum Dwellers International are particularly effective at implementing inclusive approaches for local knowledge incorporation into urban decision-making. Climate change and disaster risk exacerbate existing problems of economic development, yet macro-economic planning seldom incorporates adaptation. Recent evidence also confirms the role of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge in management practices to reduce climate risks through early warning preparedness and response (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="The Adaptation Gap in Cities and Settlements" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3.2">Section 6.3.2.3</a>). These practices are particularly important where alternative early warning methods are absent. For instance, Abudu Kasei et al. (2019) show that Indigenous knowledge gathered through observations on changes in natural indicators (such as links between rainfall patterns, certain flora and fauna, and temperature changes) could be applied to develop early warning of climate hazards (floods and droughts) in informal urban settlements in African countries such as Ghana. Similarly, Hiwaski et al. (2015) show that observations of changes in the environment and celestial bodies are used to predict climate-related hazards in Indonesia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste where communities in turn use local materials and methods, and customary practices to respond to the impacts of climate change.</p></li><li><h2>6.3.3.3_p5</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.3.3_p5">Insurance is a risk transfer mechanism for middle- and high-income countries, yet is less widely available in LMICs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Surminski--2017">Surminski and Thieken, 2017</a>). Additionally, where insurance options do exist in LMICs, these are not usually available to large populations living or operating in the informal sector. Flood insurance is widely available in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries but the demand and uptake differ significantly across countries (Hanger <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). This financial tool is subject to increasing pressure under the changing climate, with growing concerns around affordability and availability. More integrative approaches are required, such as where changes in the insurance industry are closely linked to adaptation strategies, building standards and land use planning and their application (Cremades <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). This is particularly important in LMICs and of central concern for all insurance schemes is ensuring access, fairness and affordability for the most poor and vulnerable. However, there are some notable examples of low-income communities setting up their own disaster insurance mechanisms. For example, the Community Development Funds for the Baan Mankong upgrading programme in Thailand include disaster funds as insurance against housing damage (<a class="reference-link" href="#Archer--2012">Archer, 2012</a>). Such approaches also need to be more closely linked to existing urban risk management planning approaches where urban livelihoods are seldom integrated and informed by more dynamic risk reduction frameworks that consider adaptive cycles and how resilience changes over time (<a class="reference-link" href="#Beringer--2018">Beringer and Kaewsuk, 2018</a>; Cremades <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.3.3_p6</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.3.3_p6">Disaster risk management systems face increasing challenges in adapting to evolving risk profiles, shaped by expanding urban areas and changing environmental conditions associated with climate change.

Cardiovascular fitness for example is a root cause of morbidity and mortality form heat stress (Schuster <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). The World Health Organization has developed a framework of climate-resilient health systems that addresses both mitigation and adaptation goals (<a class="reference-link" href="#WHO--2015">WHO, 2015</a>). Universal health coverage (UHC) is an essential component of climate-resilient health systems. In most countries, access to health services is better in urban than in rural areas. However, there remain large urban populations with insufficient coverage of health services (<a class="reference-link" href="#WHO%20and%20WB--2015">WHO and WB, 2015</a>) and UHC tracking needs to take better account of inequalities in coverage, including differences in access within cities and further disaggregation of urban populations by income. Thus, health sector investment is an important tool in adaptive action and capacity. Analyses of health survey data shows that, globally, access to health care is increasing toward UHC targets (Lozano <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Financing for global health has increased steadily in the last two decades and modelling shows this trend is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> to continue to 2050, but at a slower pace of growth and the current disparities in per-capita health spending persist between high and low/middle income countries, leading to insufficient health service coverage for the poorest populations (Chang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019a).

Access to knowledge is an important determinant of well-being, inclusivity and livelihood mobility and of driving human behaviour.

At the same time, concerns about the unintended consequences of investing in green infrastructure for NBS, such as how it may contribute to gentrification (Turkelboom <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Haase <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), create more public use, increase water demand (Nouri, Borujeni and Hoekstra, 2019) or contribute to criminal activity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cilliers--2015">Cilliers and Cilliers, 2015</a>) underlines the challenges of investing in adaptation in complex urban systems (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Impacts and Risks of Urban Adaptation Actions" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2.6">Section 6.2.6</a>). Additionally, more place-based analyses of the efficacy of NBS for reducing climate impacts across varying urban contexts and future climate scenarios are needed to better understand the cost effectiveness of investing in NBS to provide disaster risk reduction and deliver critical co-benefits for human well-being. Cooperation between scientists, decision-makers and Indigenous knowledge-holders can supplement current efforts and ensure that investments in NBS do not negatively impact indigenous communities (Ban <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Seddon <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021; Townsend, Moola and Craig, 2020).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.4.1_p1</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.4.1_p1">Nature-based strategies, including street trees, green roofs, green walls and other urban vegetation, can reduce heat and extreme heat by cooling private and public spaces (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>). Shading and evapotranspiration are the primary mechanisms for vegetation-induced urban cooling (Coutts <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Shading reduces mean radiant temperature, which is the dominant influence on outdoor human thermal comfort under warm, sunny conditions (Thorsson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Vigui&#233;<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Outdoor green space and parks may also slightly reduce indoor heat hazard (Vigui&#233;<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Apart from lowering temperature, NBS may also contribute to lower energy costs by reducing extra demand for conventional sources of cooling (e.g., air conditioning) (Vigui&#233;<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Foustalieraki <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), especially during peak demand periods. Homes with shade trees that are located in cities where air conditioning systems are common can save over 30% of residential peak cooling demand (Zardo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Wang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Green roofs have been shown to significantly lower surface temperatures on buildings (Bevilacqua <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017) and modelling suggests that green roofs, if employed widely throughout urban areas, have the potential to impact the regional heat profile of cities (Bevilacqua <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Rosenzweig, Gaffin and Parshall, 2006). Community or allotment gardens, backyard greening and other types of low vegetation, as well as lakes, ponds, rivers and streams, can also provide local cooling benefits to nearby residents (Gunawardena, Wells and Kershaw, 2017; Larondelle <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Santamouris--2020">Santamouris, 2020</a>).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.4.1_p2</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.4.1_p2">Urban climate models show that increased vegetation cover results in reducing both mean air temperatures and extreme temperatures during heatwaves (Heaviside, Cai and Vardoulakis, 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ferreira--2019">Ferreira and Duarte, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schubert--2013">Schubert and Grossman-Clarke, 2013</a>). Greater density and more canopy coverage relative to other built and paved surfaces increases shade provision and evapotranspiration (Hamstead <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Grilo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Herath, Halwatura and Jayasinghe, 2018; Knight <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). However, local cooling by vegetation depends on regional climate context, geographic setting of the city, urban form, the density and placement of the trees, in addition to a variety of other ecological, technical, and social factors, such as local stewardship (Salmond <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Green spaces less than 0.5&#8211;2.0 ha may have negligible cooling effects at regional scales, but impacts of shading can have microscale cooling benefits (Gunawardena, Wells and Kershaw, 2017; Zardo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Vegetation impacts on day versus night-time cooling varies (Imran <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019) as does cooling potential in temperate versus tropical climates. The supply of cooler air from surrounding peri-urban and rural areas can impact cooling in the urban core suggesting that regional adaptation planning for NBS is important to maintain or extend ventilation paths from the urban fringe into the city centre (Schau-Noppel, Kossmann and Buchholz, 2020).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.4.1_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.4.1_p3">To maximize the adaptation benefits of NBS for regulating urban heat, it can be helpful to prioritise tree planting and other urban greening investments in areas where heat vulnerability and risk are the highest, especially communities that lack urban tree canopy or accessibility to parks to cool off during hot days or heatwaves (Ziter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Planting trees closely together or in partly permeable vegetated barriers along streets can improve local cooling benefits. Additionally, choosing tree species with leaves that have the greatest leaf area index or the largest leaves can improve cooling performance, as those trees have the greatest shading and evapotranspiration benefits that, in turn, provide the greatest cooling effects (Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Drought-resistant trees, often native trees, are ideal to avoid high watering costs, though dry or water scarce areas may limit adoption of urban vegetation as an NBS strategy (Coutts <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013). Native trees and permaculture can provide additional benefits for local biodiversity as shown in study in Melbourne, Australia which found that increasing vegetation from 10% to 30% increased occupancy of bats, birds, bees, beetles and bugs by up to 130% (Threlfall <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), with particularly high impact on native species.. Additionally, planting fruit or nut trees can provide co-benefits for local food production, and yet choice of species and placement is important to consider with respect to local cultural needs and norms (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adegun--2018">Adegun, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Adegun--2017">Adegun, 2017</a>).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.4.2_p1</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.4.2_p1">NBS in cities can help regulate air quality by absorbing air pollutants (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span>). For example, planting trees <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB"></span> or vegetated barriers along streets or in urban forests can reduce particulate matter, the ambient air pollutant with the largest global health burden (<a class="reference-link" href="#Janh%C3%A4ll--2015">Janh&#228;ll, 2015</a>; Tiwary, Reff and Colls, 2008; Matos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; McDonald <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). However, findings show that trees can also positively affect ground-level ozone (Calfapietra <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013; Kroeger <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014), airborne pollen concentrations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Willis--2017">Willis and Petrokofsky, 2017</a>) and indirectly affect air quality through reduced emissions from energy production offset by shade provision (Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Certain tree species however can also be detrimental to urban ozone formation by emitting significant amounts of reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Decreasing urban emissions of VOCs is an increasingly important ozone mitigation strategy in urban areas (Fitzky <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.4.2_p2</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.4.2_p2">Trees can also have negative effects by increasing pedestrian exposure to pollution if they are introduced in heavily travelled street canyons where air pollutants can be trapped (Vos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gromke--2015">Gromke and Blocken, 2015</a>). To maximise the adaptation benefits of NBS for improving air quality, planners and managers can target tree selection for species with low VOC emissions, low allergen emissions and high pollutant deposition potential (Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019), and combine with low pollution transportation policies. Studies suggest sensitive planting of roadside tree canopies can have positive effects on air pollutants (Beckett, Freer Smith and Taylor, 2000; Yang, Chang and Yan, 2015). For example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Xue--2021">Xue et al.

Engineered devices include bioswales, rain gardens, and detention and retention ponds, and are becoming common and standard approaches to mitigate the negative effects of impervious surfaces on stormwater quality and surface flooding in cities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zhou--2014">Zhou, 2014</a>; McPhillips <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Allotment gardens, street trees, green roofs and urban forests may also help reduce runoff and provide a stormwater retention service (Pennino, McDonald and Jaffe, 2016; Berland <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Gittleman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Modelling and empirical studies show that NBS at small spatial scales lead to improvements in water quality and reduction of peak flows (Moore <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Webber <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Peak flow reductions are greatest for small rain events. For example, D-Ville et al. (2018) observed a 30&#8211;70% reduction in peak flow for the 1-in-30 year storm, but performance reduces for more intense rainfall or if saturated (Garofalo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016).

However, the magnitude of the runoff reduction service will depend on the total area of green infrastructure, vegetation type and its position on the landscape. There is less evidence of the effectiveness of NBS at larger temporal and spatial scales (Pregnolato <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Jefferson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). The performance of NBS depends on the degree to which their extent and spatial configuration in the city are optimised to capture runoff (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fry--2017">Fry and Maxwell, 2017</a>).

Cities where a large proportion of residents lack access to piped infrastructure and drink surface water may see large benefits, especially to human health, from NBS investments (Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Where future large-scale upgrades or installation of grey infrastructure will be necessary, new and growing cities may have more opportunity to realise large net benefits from investments in NBS. Older cities, and new, rapidly urbanising areas that lack large-scale water infrastructure may see the greatest benefits from enhanced NBS, relative to cities where heavy investments infrastructure upgrades have already been made. Cities facing climate changes that include more frequent or extreme precipitation may also see large water quality benefits from investment in NBS (Keeler <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).

NBS can protect coasts from flooding through reducing the wave energy by drag friction, reducing wave overtopping by eliminating vertical barriers, and absorbing floodwaters in soil (Arkema, Scyphers and Shepard, 2017; Dasgupta <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Zhu <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). For example, coastal and marine vegetation and reefs can dissipate wave energy, attenuate wave heights and nearshore currents, decrease the extent of wave run-up on beaches, and trap sediments (Ferrario <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Bridges <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). These effects result in lower water levels and reduce shoreline erosion, which in turn has potential to save lives and prevent expensive property damages (Narayan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.4.4_p2</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.4.4_p2">Researchers, practitioners and policy-makers are increasingly calling for the use of nature-based approaches to protect urban shorelines from coastal hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cunniff--2015">Cunniff and Schwartz, 2015</a>; Bilkovic <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017).

However, vegetation along protected coastlines with higher frequency, lower intensity coastal hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#National%20Research%20Council--2014">National Research Council, 2014</a>) may be more effective for stabilising shorelines and reducing risk to coastal communities and properties, and benefits will depend on local hydrology of the coastal region. <a class="reference-link" href="#Narayan--2017">Narayan et al.

However, the influence of ecosystems on flooding and erosion is variable and depends on a suite of social, ecological and infrastructural factors that vary within and among urban areas (Narayan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Ruckelshaus <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Bridges <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015).

As green infrastructure is increasingly being used for stormwater absorption in cities (McPhillips <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020), rain gardens, wetlands, or engineered infiltration ponds and bioswales are the NBS most likely to promote recharge, reduce evapotranspiration and contribute to water provisioning.</p></li><li><h2>6.3.4.7_p1</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.4.7_p1">Urban agriculture can serve as a NBS for food security (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span>) across a range of urban contexts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lwasa--2015">Lwasa and Dubbeling, 2015</a>; Nogeire-McRae <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Pourias, Aubry and Duchemin, 2016) by contributing to food provisioning as well as providing co-benefits including for recreation, place making and mental health (Petrovic <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Soga, Gaston and Yamaura, 2017; Goldstein <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016b).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.4.7_p2</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.4.7_p2">Urban agriculture among poorer communities in lower income areas is already an important source of food supply for those communities, contributing to food security and health (Orsini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013). However, potential for expanding open air urban food production may be practically constrained by land availability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Badami--2015">Badami and Ramankutty, 2015</a>; Martellozzo <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). This is particularly true in some lower-income countries where rapid urbanisation is occurring, which compounds existing food insecurity (Satterthwaite, McGranahan and Tacoli, 2010; Vermeiren <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013).

Not all cities can benefit similarly from vertical agriculture since higher heating costs to produce vegetables indoors during northern winters consumes considerable amounts of energy and may generate fossil fuel emissions depending on the energy source (Goldstein <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016a; Mohareb <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). Some regions can benefit from more traditional outdoor urban farming, such as in South and Southeast Asia, which can support multiple growing cycles per year for some crops, particularly in tropical areas where irrigation is available. Light availability, soil health and water availability will impact food production in urban areas. For example, a study conducted in Vancouver, Canada, demonstrated that light attenuation from buildings and trees can reduce both crop yield and water demand for crop growth (Johnson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.4.7_p4</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.4.7_p4">Climate change may have important impacts on urban food production and food security.

Though urban agriculture constitutes a small fraction of total food consumption in some urban areas, several studies have attempted to estimate the extent to which urban agriculture could theoretically meet urban total food or vegetable demand (<a class="reference-link" href="#Badami--2015">Badami and Ramankutty, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McClintock--2014">McClintock, 2014</a>; Hara <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Maximising the adaptation and resilience benefits of NBS for food production and security suggests the need to embrace the multi-functionality of urban agriculture, rather than viewing it as solely concerning food production (Barthel, Parker and Ernstson, 2015).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.5_p1</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.5_p1">Globally, it is estimated that as much as USD 94 trillion of investment is required between 2016 and 2040 to replace, upgrade and extend the world&#8217;s physical infrastructure (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oxford%20Economics--2017">Oxford Economics, 2017</a>), much of which is ageing and will require replacement. Given the typical lifespan of infrastructure, this is both an opportunity and an imperative to ensure this investment is low carbon and resilient to climate change risks (Grafakos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). &#8216;Grey&#8217; or physical infrastructure is a priority for adaptation because its performance is sensitive to climate (particularly extreme events) and decisions on design and renovation have long-lasting implications and are hard to reverse (&#220;rge-Vorsatz <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Avoiding longer-term impacts on society, the economy and the environment will require future investment and retrofitting of existing infrastructure, to be undertaken in the context of the risks of climate change (Dawson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Rosenzweig <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b).

Despite this, engineering measures such as seawalls for tsunami protection and cooling areas in cities provide critical hazard reduction functions in urban contexts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Depietri--2017">Depietri and McPhearson, 2017</a>).

Rapid, increased urbanisation has contributed to observed flood risks in recent decades (see Section 5 4.2.4; Tramblay <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). The design process for physical infrastructure projects and significant construction (e.g., residential or industrial estates and large industrial development) typically includes risk assessments and social and environmental impact assessments that consider neighbouring land uses and connected infrastructure. Land use planning can consider diverse land uses and their interactions at the neighbourhood level (<a class="section-link" data-title="The Adaptation Gap in Cities and Settlements" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.3.2">Section 6.3.2.1</a>).

Additionally, context-specific spatial tools and community based approaches lack a precise connection to urban morphology. For example, there is a need for further studies that connect solar radiation, urban morphology (e.g., aspect and plot ratio), and the urban heat island spatio-temporal variability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Giridharan--2018">Giridharan and Emmanuel, 2018</a>; Li <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019c).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.5.1_p2</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.5.1_p2">Several tools and models have emerged in response to recommendations from AR5, including models that assess the impacts of urban heat island (Ramyar, Zarghami and Bryant, 2019), climatic uncertainty (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dhar--2017">Dhar and Khirfan, 2017</a>), flood vulnerability (Abebe, Kabir and Tesfamariam, 2018) and inundation (Barau <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Ford <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). For example, findings from Kano, Nigeria, reveal that a lack of distribution of certain urban morphological features, including open spaces and streets (both pervious and impervious), roof and building materials (e.g., concrete and metallic) and urban ecological features (e.g., urban ponds and ecological basin), exacerbates inundations and their associated impacts (Barau <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Also, findings about the urban forms of coastal settlements, particularly in small islands, reveal that they often experience severe beach erosion due to wave action, sea level rise and storm surge that leads to landward retreat of coastline which threatens their social and economic activities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dhar--2016">Dhar and Khirfan, 2016</a>; Lane <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Khirfan--2019">Khirfan and El-Shayeb, 2019</a>).

These can include installing air conditioning, establishing public cooling centres (i.e., for use during heatwaves), pavement watering (Parison <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020a) and increasing surface albedo through &#8216;cool roofs&#8217; (i.e., with high-reflectance materials) and walls. Air conditioning can significantly increase the local urban heat island (Salamanca <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Wang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019a) and the choice of refrigerant has a significant impact on global warming potential (McLinden <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). The relative efficiency of cool roofs compared with green roofs is variable, because while white roofs have similar potential to reduce the urban heat island (Li, Bou-Zeid and Oppenheimer, 2014), they can quickly turn grey due to dust and air pollution, losing their effectiveness (Gunawardena, Wells and Kershaw, 2017), although these effects are now well studied and newer performance standards should account for ageing and soiling effects on reflectivity (Paolini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014). Ageing of &#8216;cool pavements&#8217; is more complex, which makes their long-term performance less reliable to predict (Lontorfos, Efthymiou and Santamouris, 2018). The cooling performance of green roofs is highly variable and depends on the actual water content of the green roof substrate, with dry vegetation performing poorly in terms of cooling (Parison <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020b). This holds true for regular vegetation and NBS in general (Daniel, Lemonsu and Viguie, 2018).

They include buildings that are adaptive to ensure user comfort during extremes of hot and cold as well as to floods (e.g., building on stilts and amphibian architecture).

However, it must be noted that the cooling potential of natural ventilation will decrease in the future because of increasing outdoor air temperatures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gilani--2020">Gilani and O&#8217;Brien, 2020</a>). Increased insulation (including through green solutions) without shading and ventilation can also lead to adverse impacts through the lowering of nighttime cooling (Reder <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Similarly, air conditioning performance also decreases with increasing outdoor temperatures, in addition to being maladaptive where use increases anthropogenic heat emissions into the urban area, and global greenhouse gas emissions if powered by carbon intensive energy systems (Wang <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018c).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.5.2_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.5.2_p3">Passive cooling is a design-based, widely used strategy to create naturally ventilated buildings, making it an important alternative to address the urban heat island for residential and commercial buildings (Al-Obaidi, Ismail and Rahman, 2014).

These features may be arranged to address hotspots or highly frequented spaces within buildings. Similar to NBS, the effectiveness of passive cooling to ameliorate the urban heat island varies widely depending on the location of the sun, wind direction and the type of strategy used. For instance, natural ventilation strategies (e.g., wind towers, solar chimneys, etc.) have shown temperature reductions of up to 14&#176;C (Bhamare, Rathod and Banerjee, 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Calautit--2016">Calautit and Hughes, 2016</a>; Rabani <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014).

In the absence of centralised responses, low-income residents in Nairobi (Kenya) dig trenches and construct temporary dikes to protect homes, and in Accra (Ghana) the community has developed a range of social responses, including communal drains and local evacuation teams, to help protect people and critical valuables, although these innovations require connection to city-wide infrastructure to effectively reduce widespread risk (<a class="reference-link" href="#Amoako--2018">Amoako, 2018</a>).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.5.7_p5</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.5.7_p5">More recent developments include sensor arrays to catalogue a river&#8217;s reach and how changing hydraulics interact with roadways (Forbes <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).

Examples include the use of a bioretention basin in Scottsdale (Arizona, USA) to accommodate excess runoff and help drain the city; a subsidy for affected farmers for lost crop production as part of the Netherlands&#8217; Room for the River programme; targeted destruction of a levee to control flooding in the Mississippi River Valley in 2011 (Kim <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Water-sensitive urban design, low-impact development, sponge cities, sustainable urban drainage and natural flood management involve deployment of systems and practices that use or mimic natural processes that result in the infiltration, evapotranspiration or use of stormwater to protect water quality and associated aquatic habitat. These are being designed and implemented at increasingly ambitious scales. For example, China&#8217;s Sponge City initiative sets a goal of 80% of urban land able to absorb or reuse 70% of stormwater through underground storage tanks and tunnels, and use of pervious pavements, in addition to NBS (Chan <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Muggah--2019">Muggah, 2019</a>).

Physical infrastructure includes seawalls, dikes, breakwaters, revetments, groynes and tidal barriers. Adapted infrastructure can alter risks in morphologically connected areas, and lead to increased residual risk by encouraging more construction in the coastal zone (Miller, Gabe and Sklarz, 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ludy--2012">Ludy and Kondolf, 2012</a>).

Although infrastructure, ranging from social to ecological and physical to digital, can help to reduce the impacts of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stewart--2014">Stewart and Deng, 2014</a>; Bar&#243; Porras <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021), there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span> of how infrastructures, implemented to reduce climate risk, also reduce inequality. Rather, there is more evidence to suggest that both adaptation plans and associated infrastructure implementation pathways are increasing inequality in cities and settlements (Chu, Anguelovski and Carmin, 2016; Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Romero-Lankao--2019">Romero-Lankao and Gnatz, 2019</a>). Social, economic and cultural structures that marginalise people by race, class, ethnicity and gender all contribute in complex ways to climate injustices and need to be urgently addressed for adaptation options to shift to benefit those most vulnerable, rather than mainly benefitting the already privileged and maintaining the status quo (Thomas <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Porter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ranganathan--2019">Ranganathan and Bratman, 2019</a>).

Recognition can be supported through a capabilities approach that helps to bring attention to past cultural domination and enable citizens to develop the functioning life they choose (Schlosberg, Collins and Niemeyer, 2017). This brings a focus on local action, emphasising the relevance to vulnerability reduction and resilience building of individual and local/community capacities and supporting structures. This blurs the distinction between climate change adaptation and community development, with the former firmly embedded in the latter. Struggles for recognition are deeply political and central to adaptation responses which requires increased focus on power to support more equitable and just adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nightingale--2017">Nightingale, 2017</a>).

There are also differences in who benefits from infrastructures, as they are inherently political, embedded in social contexts, politics and cultural norms (<a class="reference-link" href="#McFarlane--2017">McFarlane and Silver, 2017</a>) and often tend to benefit those already privileged (<a class="reference-link" href="#Henrique--2019">Henrique and Tschakert, 2019</a>).

Similarly, areas suffering from disinvestment in infrastructure might have a high risk of flooding (<a class="reference-link" href="#Haddock--2013">Haddock and Edwards, 2013</a>). Zoning and land use trade-offs have been seen to be unequally skewed in favour of prime real estate and economically valuable assets (e.g., protecting factories and refineries from flooding) (Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Carter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015).

For example, an assessment of sustainable urban mobility plans in Portugal showed that some areas have considered equity in their plans and increased access for disadvantaged users including the elderly and disabled, but in other cities this is lacking (Arsenio, Martens and Di Ciommo, 2016).

In the case of the 2015&#8211;17 Cape Town drought, wealthy households secured their water needs through off-grid technologies such as rainwater tanks and boreholes. Although this resulted in more water being available in the dams, it also led to less revenue being collected for municipal water and less ability to cross-subsidise water for poor households (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ziervogel--2019b">Ziervogel, 2019b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Simpson--2019">Simpson, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bigger--2019">Bigger and Millington, 2019</a>). More attention needs to be paid to how shifts in infrastructure are serving the interests of urban elites, often driven by the state, and failing to adequately consider the needs of the disadvantaged (Bulkeley, Cast&#225;n Broto and Edwards, 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ajibade--2017">Ajibade, 2017</a>; Shi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016).

Further, migrants and their settlements are likely unrecognised in spatial or infrastructure development plans. In this context, social infrastructure, zoning and land use planning for climate adaptation has triggered inequity through omission, as some planning process have been racialised and excluded groups such as migrants and ethnic minorities (Anguelovski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016).

It is also harder for many from low-income areas to rebuild after an extreme event. Lack of housing tenure and sub-standard housing has been shown to limit the ability of residents to improve and manage their landscapes and therefore it is hard for them to enhance energy efficiency (Dempsey <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2011). Access to information is critical for adapting to climate risk and reducing vulnerability to hazards, yet access to this information is often not equally available (Ma <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014).

For example, the case of an area of peri-urban Bangkok experiencing localised flooding due to unregulated private sector development saw households take both individual (building flood walls around homes, digging temporary drainage swales in the carriageway) and collective action (petitioning authorities, pumping water into vacant land). These actions, to a certain extent, merely displaced the flood water to other areas, or created new problems by damaging the carriageway, creating negative impacts on other households and the wider community.

There has been a strong interest in delivering development benefits alongside climate mitigation, thus benefiting the overall infrastructure base (Suckall, Stringer and Tompkins, 2015). Some of these co-benefits have also emerged in experiences of urban planning, pointing toward the dilemma of separating adaptation and mitigation in a context in which integration, rather than an analytical differentiation, was seen as being required to transcend work in silos (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aylett--2015">Aylett, 2015</a>). Because urban planning needs to carefully consider long time scales, the neat separation between mitigation and adaptation runs counter to integrated forms of planning that can consider scales (time and space) carefully and that are aimed to deliver the sustainable city as a whole (Solecki <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Grafakos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.6.2_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.6.2_p3">For example, the ideas of climate resilient development and climate compatible development help planners to consider the simultaneous wins that emerge between adaptation, mitigation and development, requiring institutional building and partnerships to deliver triple win solutions (Stringer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Seo, Jaber and Srinivasan, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mitchell--2010">Mitchell and Maxwell, 2010</a>).

For example, establishing safe and convenient walking and cycling infrastructure can lead to improvements in population health, thereby highlighting the close interaction between urban land use, infrastructure and population health (Schuster <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), while clean cooking has the potential to deliver positive health outcomes alongside improvements in air quality and emissions reductions and through reducing pressure on woodland as a fuel source for expanding urban populations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Msoffe--2017">Msoffe, 2017</a>). Furthermore, active transport infrastructure reduces air pollution and related health risks, and helps to mitigate further climate change (Schuster <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017). These are supported by city networks such as the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration and the Clean Air Coalition that complements WHO guidelines and standards, for example through the Breathe Life Campaign. In conclusion, in both urban environments and infrastructural sectors, triple wins are only realisable through broader perspectives that link climate compatible development to institutional change or the achievements of wider welfare objectives such as those enshrined in the United Nations 2030 Agenda of Development (Cast&#225;n Broto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; England <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.6.2_p4</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.6.2_p4">The aspiration to deliver climate change action within a broader agenda of transformative change, introduced in the SREX report, received renewed attention after the publication of IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C, which argues for a focus on urban transformations and highlighted that informal settlements were vital for understanding the delivery of these transformations. Deep decarbonisation has emerged as a new idea that regards the development of low or zero carbon pathways as a condition for good adaptation in the long term. Decarbonisation becomes urgent in the face of growing impacts attributable to climate change (Ribera <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; Bataille <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Wesseling <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017).

These gains are not limited to urban areas. The reliance on connected urban&#8211;rural systems for water, food and fuel has led to city government and urban-based businesses supporting landscape adaptations in rural hinterlands with strong potential for mitigation and rural development co-benefits. Water Funds bring downstream urban public and private finance to support upstream rural residents to make land use and agricultural management decisions to avoid damaging runoff, soil erosion and downstream sedimentation with reduction in water quality and increased flood risk. There are more than 30 Water Funds in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. These operate at landscape scale; the Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund, Kenya (Vogl <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017), planned for a USD 10 million investment in Water Fund-led conservation interventions, with a projected return of USD 21.5 million in economic benefits over a 30-year timeframe (<a class="reference-link" href="#Apse--2015">Apse and Bryant, 2015</a>).

Globally, in 2020, about 431.7 million vulnerable people were exposed to extreme heat during the COVID-19 pandemic, including about 75.5 million during the July and August 2020 European heatwave, with an excess mortality of over 9000 people arising from heat exposure (<a class="reference-link" href="#Walton--2020">Walton and van Aalst, 2020</a>).</p></li><li><h2>box-6.4_p2</h2><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-6.4_p2">The pandemic has demonstrated the multiple, often reinforcing, ways in which specific drivers of vulnerability interact both in generating urban risk and shaping who is more or less able to recover (Phillips <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Honey-Ros&#233;s <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020) (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Impacts and Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.2">Section 6.2</a>). Again, this is not a new lesson for urban climate change adaptation, but it is a lesson that has not yet been seen to enter into routine practice for urban adaptation. Two key challenges for climate change adaptation are the associations between COVID-19 risk and urban connectivity and overcrowding. Connectivity has been presented in urban adaptation policy as a virtue, a means to share risk and diversity inputs (Ge <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kim--2020">Kim and Bostwick, 2020</a>), COVID-19 has surfaced the unevenness with which people and places are connected and also the need to balance connectivity against risk transfer, through the failure of food supply chains or remittance flows, as well as by the direct transfer of disease (Challinor <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). High-density living has advantages for urban resource efficiency including benefiting climate change mitigation. When high-density living is not supported by adequate access to critical infrastructure (sufficient internal living space, access to potable water and sanitation, access to open green space), this exacerbates overcrowding and generates vulnerability to multiple risks, including climate change hazards and communicable disease (Bamweyana <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Hamidi, Sabouri and Ewing, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Peters--2020">Peters, 2020</a>; Satterthwaite <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). Where overcrowding coincides with precarious livelihoods, for example in informal settlements, risk is further elevated (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wilkinson--2020">Wilkinson, 2020</a>). Neighbourhood associations (a benefit of high-density living) have been an important source of resilience through providing trusted information, access to food and water for washing during the pandemic and serving populations unable to access government or market provision (Pelling <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). Here local organising has not only met gaps in service provision, but opened dialogue to vision and organise for alternative development futures. These distinctly urban challenges should be read as a sub-set of wider cross-cutting lessons for recovery from COVID-19 (see Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7).</p></li><li><h2>6.3.7_p1</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.7_p1">Table 6.6 represents the contribution of 21 adaptation measures identified in this chapter to 17 components of climate resilient development (CRD).

Challenges to the contributions of grey/physical infrastructure, where adaptation through nature-based solutions and social policy offer alternatives are a lack of flexibility post-deployment constraining ability to flex as climate and vulnerability change; risk transferred to other people/places, not resolved; negative ecological consequences; and <span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span> of targeting marginality and inequality.</p></li><li><h2>6.3.7_p12</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.3.7_p12">The significance of a CRD lens for the evaluation of adaptation strategy can be seen in approaches to riverine and coastal flooding.

The benefits of physical infrastructure interventions for strengthening existing livelihoods and protecting health, for being deployable at scale and supporting other infrastructures to adapt are recognised and set these against challenges including hazard generation and risk transfer, limited flexibility, ecological harm, carbon costs and an undermining of social inclusion and accountability.

In the context of the SGDs mission to leave-no-one behind, transformative adaptation addresses fundamental systems&#8217; functions to enable enhanced social justice and socio-ecological well-being. Incremental adaptation actions seek to maintain the essence and integrity of a system or process at a given scale (see Annex II: Glossary). Adaptation that seeks only to defend existing development status will not contribute to enhanced well-being and is not transformative, even if fundamental infrastructure engineering or legislative systems are changed to maintain the status quo in the face of increasing risk (Mendizabal <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p></li><li><h2>6.4_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4_p3">City populations and non-state actors, together with local and regional governments, can play an essential role in creating enabling conditions for action, including, for example, civil society mobilising concerns of marginalised voices and future generations, as indicated in the worldwide student mobilisations against climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wood--2019">Wood, 2019</a>; Maor, Tosun and Jordan, 2017; Cloutier, Papin and Bizier, 2018; Prendergast <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021), which may then be prioritised by local and regional governments.

Potential reasons for the continued lack of studies in these areas include the centralised character of decision making systems in countries in these regions and the early stage of adaptation planning in these urban areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Clar--2019">Clar, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mitchell--2019">Mitchell and Laycock, 2019</a>; Olazabal <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019a).</p></li><li><h2>6.4.1_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.1_p3">Flexible institutions that allow for both top-down and bottom-up action can bring capacities together from across levels of government and actors within a settlement (Sharifi and Yamagata, 2017). Predominant planning and capacity-building strategies, however, lack the flexibility to address the needs of a rapidly changing environment (Carter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dhar--2017">Dhar and Khirfan, 2017</a>; Juhola, 2016). Efforts to adapt to new challenges may have to speed up. This is especially true in urban areas and settlements with lower levels of development and experiencing rapid urbanisation, growing inequality and exposure to multiple hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dulal--2019">Dulal, 2019</a>; Grafakos <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019; Solecki <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Even within cities that share similar characteristics, there are considerable differences in the level of investment in adaptation (Georgeson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). There is also a danger that uncoordinated actions for climate change mitigation and adaptation may constrain future adaptation opportunities or create maladaptation (Juhola <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). The evidence emerging since the AR5 suggests that institutional change can be accelerated by closer collaboration between the diverse actors and deployment of the diverse approaches that can deliver adaptation.</p></li><li><h2>6.4.1.1_p1</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.1.1_p1">The assessment of cases of local adaptation demonstrates that most urban adaptation is led by local governments (although the local government is also a heterogeneous category and local governance arrangements may vary across administrative and political contexts) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Amundsen <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Lesnikowski <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2021). Local government reform at different levels can improve local adaptation, whether this is by strengthening specific teams or building cross-departmental linkages (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Paterson <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shi--2019">Shi, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wamsler--2018">Wamsler and Raggers, 2018</a>). Adaptation success often depends on having political champions driving the adaptation agenda alongside measures such as access to a knowledge base, resources at hand, political stability and the presence of dense social networks that can be supported through local government reform (Pasquini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Aligning adaptation objectives with other potential benefits of sustainable development also supports adaptation. Specifically, policies and plans that link adaptation to the objectives of Agenda 2030 supports action at the local level (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN-Habitat--2016b">UN-Habitat, 2016b</a>). Showing the economic benefits of adaptation is a strategy for local institutions to gain support for adaptation action. For example, local governments in Surat, Indore and Bhubaneswar in India linked adaptation to local development needs in experiments that facilitated accessing human and finance resources, at the local, national and international levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chu--2016">Chu, 2016</a>). However, linking adaptation to co-benefits may also divide efforts and reduce the effectiveness of adaptation actions. For example, urban land use planning and management in Ambo town, Ethiopia, resulted in the implementation of urban greening projects, but these projects did not directly address the climate-related disaster risks affecting the settlement, including urban flooding, water stress, water shortages, increased urban heat, wind and dust storms (Ogato <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017).</p></li><li><h2>6.4.1.1_p2</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.1.1_p2">Multi-level governance measures that support local governments can foster robust adaptation approaches and address risks and vulnerabilities across scales (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Westman, Broto and Huang, 2019; Hardoy <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Romero-Lankao--2015">Romero-Lankao and Hardoy, 2015</a>).

In this context, the local government has minimal access to human and financial resources. Without national support, the local government struggles to coordinate action among different stakeholders. National urban adaptation directives can influence municipal governments&#8217; action and planning, but evidence suggests that national policy alone is not sufficient to deliver action on the ground without understanding local conditions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Archer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; Lehmann <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015).</p></li><li><h2>6.4.1.1_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.1.1_p3">There are barriers for municipal adaptation plans to deliver effective adaptation outcomes and implemented actions often diverge from plans (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Monitoring and Evaluation Frameworks for Adaptation Used in Cities, Settlements and Infrastructures" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.6">Section 6.4.6</a>).

For example, real estate responses to flooding have led to processes of climate gentrification, whereby lower income populations are displaced toward higher risk areas which stablishes racialised and class-based patterns of inequality of exposure to risk, with hard evidence rapidly growing specially in US cities (Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018a; Shokry, Connolly and Anguelovski, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#De%20Koning--2020">De Koning and Filatova, 2020</a>; Aune, Gesch and Smith, 2020). Private-sector participation in adaptation solutions depend on having mechanisms to enable transparency and open reporting on the nature of support and the solutions proposed. For example, businesses adopting &#8216;community-centric&#8217; disaster management strategies can assist local recovery efforts by protecting employment, provision of emergency supplies and participation in reparations (<a class="reference-link" href="#McKnight--2016">McKnight and Linnenluecke, 2016</a>). Private sector actors engaged in community climate responses can play a role in funding and managing programmes that address public health and education concerns. The potential of ecopreneurship, social enterprises, cooperatives and other sustainability-oriented business models (Schaltegger, Hansen and L&#252;deke-Freund, 2016; Lopes <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020; Battaglia, Gragnani and Annesi, 2020) for urban adaptation remains under-explored in the literature on urban climate governance.</p></li><li><h2>6.4.1.3_p4</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.1.3_p4">The private sector also constitutes a key stakeholder group involved in collaborative processes to develop adaptation strategies.

Rotterdam has created an institutional environment that favours eco-innovation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Huang-Lachmann--2016">Huang-Lachmann and Lovett, 2016</a>). The municipal government works directly with the private sector to enhance protection against flooding constructing a marketing strategy around a &#8216;floating city&#8217; concept. A &#8216;floating housing&#8217; market has expanded, with benefits for the local real estate and construction industries and knowledge-exporting businesses that provide consultation expertise, delta technologies and architectural models.

Partnerships can deliver infrastructure, coordinate policy and support learning. The main limitation of partnerships is scale, as partnership action is usually limited to discrete projects or objectives. Partnerships tend to be linked to reactive (rather than proactive) adaptation projects and the deviation of objectives away from adaptation concerns (Harman, Taylor and Lane, 2015). Partnerships can support capacity building in public and private organisations and facilitate networking efforts that extend beyond the private sector to communities and NGOs (Bauer and Steurer, 2014; Cast&#225;n Broto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Public actors can benefit from the private sector&#8217;s innovation and implementation capacity, and businesses can de-risk investments.

For example, the Rockefeller Foundation&#8217;s 100 Resilient Cities program (2014&#8211;2019) provided a two-year salary for a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) to be situated in a municipal authority to bridge silos, incentivise change and develop development strategies for resilience (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bellinson--2019">Bellinson and Chu, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Spaans--2017">Spaans and Waterhout, 2017</a>).

(2018) have documented how the colonial and postcolonial history of water management in Bengaluru shapes the water infrastructure and provision systems today. Water access inequalities can be traced to the patterns of spatial development developed by colonial policies. Records from the sixth century onwards show how city rulers invested in an interconnected, community managed network of tanks and open wells, regularly recharged through harvested rainwater. The water system was changed at the end of the 18th century, as first the colonial state, then the post-independence government of Karnataka took responsibility for water management. Ideas of modernist planning influenced the development of new water infrastructure and piped networks, including the first piped infrastructure, bringing water from sources 30 km away, including the Hesaraghatta and then the TG Halli reservoirs. The old network of tanks gradually deteriorated as tanks became disused, polluted or built over. More prolonged and costly water transfers took place in the post-colonial period, delivering water from the Cauvery River in a massive engineering project with a high energetic cost and enmeshed in inter-state conflicts over water use (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cast%C3%A1n%20Broto--2019">Cast&#225;n Broto and Sudhira, 2019</a>). Scarcity is still a problem in Bengaluru.

Unnikrishnan et al.

Many of the barriers that inhibit institutions acting in ways that can support action for inclusive and sustainable adaptation have historical roots, grounded in complex political and social relations and can be reinforcing (Table 6.7).

Institutional change at the local level can be achieved with diverse strategies (Patterson, de Voogt and Sapiains, 2019). Table 6.7 illustrates various instruments that enable the institutionalisation of climate adaptation concerns into policy and planning. As Table 6.7 shows, institutional change is often used as synonymous with mainstreaming. Both terms refer to the integration of climate adaptation concerns into other areas of work and as part of practical routines and arguments (Chu, Anguelovski and Carmin, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Storbj%C3%B6rk--2015">Storbj&#246;rk and Uggla, 2015</a>; Runhaar <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018; Uittenbroek <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014).

ReResearch conducted across two municipalities in Western Cape, South Africa, showed the importance of a dedicated environmental champion, access to a knowledge base, the availability of resources, political stability and the presence of dense social networks (Pasquini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015). Research from S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil, showed how intrinsic political capacities and contextual factors, such as the political ideology of elected officials, shaped opportunities for embedding adaptation into ongoing urban agendas (Di Giulio <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).</p></li><li><h2>6.4.2.1_p2</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.2.1_p2">Networks, interactions and actor coalitions shape options for institutional change. <a class="reference-link" href="#Aylett--2015">Aylett (2015)</a> noted the importance of internal networks between municipal departments, including informal communication channels, cultivating personal contacts and trust between the person or team responsible for climate planning and staff within other local government agencies. Internal networks can facilitate the commitment of local elected officials (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hughes--2015">Hughes, 2015</a>), support higher municipal expenditures per capita and foster perceptions that climate adaptation is needed (Shi, Chu and Debats, 2015).

In urban areas in Africa, research on internal networks has also investigated how informal arrangements shape action possibilities (Satterthwaite <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). For example, in Zimbabwe, informal, traditional and civil society institutions are core arenas for issue discussion because of lower public sector capacities (Mubaya and Mafongoya, 2017).

Processual levers may be also mobilised in situations of political instability (which disrupts patterns in champions and networks), clientelism (which can cause environmental projects to be discontinued) (Pasquini <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2015) or in contexts where there are high political and socioeconomic inequalities (Harris, Chu and Ziervogel, 2018; Chu, Anguelovski and Carmin, 2016).</p></li><li><h2>6.4.2.2_p1</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.2.2_p1">Output-driven institutional change is shaped by organisational products such as strategies, plans, policies and evaluative metrics (<a class="reference-link" href="#Patterson--2019">Patterson and Huitema, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bellinson--2019">Bellinson and Chu, 2019</a>) (See Table 6.8). There are numerous examples of institutional change through planning outcomes. For example, Manizales, Colombia has included climate adaptation into long-established environmental policy (Biomanizales) and a local environmental action plan (Bioplan), which follows on from a long coherent trajectory of climate change policy (Hardoy and Vel&#225;squez Barrero, 2014). A significant number of North American cities have integrated adaptation into long-range plans, while fewer cities integrate adaptation in sustainable development plans or sectoral plans (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aylett--2015">Aylett, 2015</a>). Canadian cities are more likely to have a plan specifically focused on adaptation rather than having adaptation integrated into municipal long-range planning (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aylett--2015">Aylett, 2015</a>). In the European Union, adaptation plans depended on national climate legislation or, in fewer cases, the influence of an international climate network (Reckien <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018b). A comparative report from the Covenant of Mayors, however, suggests that the adaptation pillar needs development to demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptation responses and their integration with mitigation goals (Bertoldi <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020).

There are also multiple scales of action, from the provision of local services to large infrastructures of national or even international significance. Figure 6.5 provides an insight into the challenges that shape the policy action gap and a range of strategies that can help bridge policy action gaps.

Adaptation action solely focused on action tends to ignore areas in the city for which there is no existing data even though actions in these areas may play an essential role in shaping resilience and its limits. Informal settlements and informal economies, which are integral in managing urban resources for effective climate adaptation, are not routinely included in formal urban and national monitoring(<a class="reference-link" href="#Guibrunet--2016">Guibrunet and Cast&#225;n Broto, 2016</a>). The resulting understanding and monitoring of city needs, capacities and actions that feed into policy is incomplete. The innovation, as well as particular concerns and capacities of the informal sector, which is often highly gendered, are not always measured (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brown--2016">Brown and McGranahan, 2016</a>). An emphasis on measurable adaptation outcomes may lead to prioritising techno-economic measures to adaptation at the local level. Technocratic approaches to environmental policy continue to shape local sustainability politics (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bulkeley--2015">Bulkeley, 2015</a>). The deployment of such technocratic approaches at the local scale is detrimental for democratic and collaborative practices (<a class="reference-link" href="#Metzger--2020">Metzger and Lindblad, 2020</a>). For example, while China has received praise in terms of delivering urban policies that put climate change at its core, thus suggesting its role providing leadership in climate change debates (Liu <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wang--2015">Wang and He, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fu--2017">Fu and Zhang, 2017</a>), other analyses suggest that processes of planning should take greater account of certain groups and interests (<a class="reference-link" href="#Westman--2018">Westman and Broto, 2018</a>).

The integration of climate adaptation in local policies in cities and settlements has often been seen as maintaining business-as-usual and not always aligned with transformative efforts to address structural drivers of vulnerability (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). For example, mainstream actions that seek to advance other development objectives, as explained above, may reduce adaptation to &#8216;low-hanging fruits&#8217;, which may maintain business-as-usual practices without any fundamental transformation of the social, institutional and economic systems that drive vulnerabilities (Aylett, 2014). However, as explained above, mainstreaming can also generate wider processes of institutional change (<a class="section-link" data-title="Institutional Change to Deliver Adaptation in Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.2">Section 6.4.2</a>).

While not all adaptation will be transformative, transformative capacities support both ongoing adaptation efforts and the broader systemic change processes that align adaptation efforts with decarbonisation requirements and the delivery of SDGs. &#8216;Urban transformative capacity&#8217; focuses on understanding what elements of a system to respond to external changing conditions in a manner that transforms the system toward a more sustainable state (Ziervogel, Cowen and Ziniades, 2016). The capacities required to deliver adaptation action in cities and settlements are &#8216;transformative capacities&#8217;, because they move away from thinking of adaptation as an adjustment to a changing external environment to think instead of it as a reconfiguration of infrastructures and institutions to build resilience in the surrounding environment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pelling--2010">Pelling, 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Matyas--2015">Matyas and Pelling, 2015</a>).

The components of transformative capacity in cities and settlements can be grouped into three categories (see Table 6.9): (1) agency and forms of interaction, (2) development processes and (3) relational dimensions (Wolfram, 2016). Alongside different forms of technical expertise, there is a need to broaden the interventions of disadvantaged populations in urban sustainability (Wolfram, Borgstr&#246;m and Farrelly, 2019).</p></li><li><h2>6.4.4_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.4_p3">Table 6.9 presents a defined framework of ideas that local institutions, mostly local governments, can put into practice to improve their adaptive capacity. Enabling transformative capacity requires novel governance arrangements based on broad participation, a diversity of actor networks, socially embedded leadership and empowerment of communities, alongside an understanding of the system dynamics, which refers to system awareness, collective visions, practical experimentation, reflexivity, capacity building, institutional mainstreaming and the multiple levels of agency or scales (Ziervogel, Cowen and Ziniades, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ziervogel--2019a">Ziervogel, 2019a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wolfram--2019">Wolfram, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#H%C3%B6lscher--2020">H&#246;lscher and Frantzeskaki, 2020</a>; Cast&#225;n Broto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). Many of the transformative capacity components are already visible in local adaptation actions, but many efforts emphasise one element at the expense of others without delivering a systemic perspective. In particular, measures to facilitate the empowerment of communities, reflexivity and social learning are rare but often point toward heightened capacities for transformative, alongside incremental, adaptation (Cast&#225;n Broto <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018).

A local government&#8217;s capacity to collect revenues is further mediated by incomes within a city (which dictates the prospective tax base) and the capacity of civil servants to administer taxes, fees and charges. The result is that metropolitan and local governments&#8217; budgets vary dramatically, across and within countries. For example, per capita municipal budgets vary from USD 1114 in Saskatoon and USD 2682 in Peterborough (Canada), USD 2635 in Leipzig and USD 3638 in Freiburg (Germany), to USD 4907 in Bristol and USD 5612 in Aberdeen (UK) (<a class="reference-link" href="#L%C3%B6ffler--2016">L&#246;ffler, 2016</a>).</p></li><li><h2>6.4.5.1_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.5.1_p3">Revenue streams are often insufficient relative to the scale of adaptation requirements. For example, Kano, Nigeria, is a large urban area that urgently needs investment in human development and climate resilience but where a fragmented local government has little capacity to finance their climate plans (Mohammed, Hassan and Badamasi, 2019). Many local governments are unable to mobilise funds for adaptation as they face competing priorities, meaning that resources for resilience must be allocated by higher levels of government (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hughes--2015">Hughes, 2015</a>), which also perceive opportunity costs to adaptation investments. Funding from non-state actors is, therefore, proving important. For example, in the USA, private foundations and non-profit organisations account for 17% and 16%, respectively, of adaptation support in urban areas (Carmin, Nadkarni and Rhie, 2012). However, tapping into these funding sources raises complex questions about accountability and ownership of urban adaptation (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018).

These capital sources have different risk&#8211;return expectations and investment horizons, so they will suit different types and stages of projects.

However, predominant approaches are typically not conducted at the appropriate scale to inform adaptation decision-making (Ford <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018). While some scholars advocate the use of a unifying indicator of social vulnerability (Spielman <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020), others propose to develop flexible sets of comparable indicators that can be adjusted to different contexts (Leiter <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019). Risk-based approaches are seen as an alternative in a context where the monitoring of decision-relevant variables in urban climate adaptation planning is essential to link climatic risk assessment and action (Hallegatte and Engle, 2019; Kingsborough, Borgomeo and Hall, 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#McDermott--2018">McDermott and Surminski, 2018</a>). Because of the need to define normative frameworks for risk evaluation, what is acceptable, for what purpose and for how long (Galarraga <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2018), these approaches may offer an opportunity for the generation of a shared understanding on goals and limitations of adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#McDermott--2018">McDermott and Surminski, 2018</a>). However, risk-based indicators may also create a bias toward quantifiable variables that tend to be based on climatic modelling outputs, engineering or financial assessments. Based on this and various examples of urban development projects, Hallegatte and Engle (2019) claim it is important to consider output-based indicators and process-based indicators that talk about government, voice and empowerment. Overall, dozens of indicator-based approaches to assess climate adaptation have been proposed across the scientific and policy literature, especially in the broader framework of (community) resilience assessment tools (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sharifi--2016">Sharifi, 2016</a>; Feldmeyer <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019), and in different sectors, for example the climate benefits of NBS (Kabisch <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016; Donatti <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020).

Cities worldwide face important social, environmental and economic conflicts related to resource inequality, poverty, environmental pollution and social tensions that coexist with climatic risks. It makes sense to integrate climate change adaptation assessment goals and needs into existing frameworks for the sake of efficiency. This will benefit small urban areas and cities in developing regions that often face data scarcity and may also find available indicators irrelevant to their realities and, thus, be required to adjust them (Simon <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Efforts to coordinate frameworks for the assessment of sustainability (e.g., Local Agenda, sustainability appraisals), resilience (e.g., 100 Resilient Cities, new standards for urban resilience), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting (e.g., Global Covenant of Mayors for Energy and Climate) can be deployed to learn about contexts. However, they need to be applied with caution as enforcing external requirements may lead to local tensions during their application (for example Roberts <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2020). In a context where adaptation efforts need to be aggregated and evaluated across nations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Magnan--2016">Magnan, 2016</a>) and their implications on wider objectives such as sustainable development and social justice need to be assessed (<a class="reference-link" href="#Long--2019">Long and Rice, 2019</a>), urban adaptation monitoring and evaluation can inform national and international processes that enable a global stocktake of adaptation.</p></li><li><h2>6.4.7_p1</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.7_p1">Growing awareness of the interlocking of drivers of urban change and vulnerability has motivated an interest in transformational approaches to adaptation action in cities, settlements and infrastructure. While the idea of transformation has been adopted across the field, there is no consensus about what an urban transformation that addresses adaptation means. There is no one single transformative solution or approach relevant in every case (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shi--2019">Shi, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Goh--2019">Goh, 2019</a>). What constitutes &#8216;urgent&#8217; and &#8216;far-reaching&#8217; transformation depends on the local community&#8217;s expectations and ideas (Choko <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2019).</p></li><li><h2>6.4.7_p2</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.7_p2">Transformation is often approached as a process of institutional transformation, akin to the process described in <a class="section-link" data-title="Institutional Change to Deliver Adaptation in Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6#6.4.2">Section 6.4.2</a> (see, for example, <a class="reference-link" href="#Duijn--2017">Duijn and van Buuren, 2017</a>). Transformation engages with critiques of adaptation or risk reduction as an individual responsibility (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sou--2018">Sou, 2018</a>). The idea is to use transformation to focus on coordinating collective efforts (Haque et al, 2014). The coordination of multiple actors is a condition to enable transformative institutions (Torabi et al, 2018) and link adaptation action to development efforts (Chu et al, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roberts--2013">Roberts and O&#8217;Donoghue, 2013</a>). The role of communities and citizens in such an approach to transformation is ambiguous. Sometimes communities and citizens are presented as critical agents of transformation (Limthongsakul et al, 2017). Other times, however, they are simply situated within strong and durable networks that provide the institutional setting to build resilience (Dani&#232;re <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016). Despite the political nature of transformative approaches and the evidence that transformative approaches rely on protest and political activism, few authors recognise this strategy (but see <a class="reference-link" href="#Bahadur--2014">Bahadur and Tanner, 2014</a>; Chu, Anguelovski and Roberts, 2017; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dierwechter--2013">Dierwechter and Wessells, 2013</a>).</p></li><li><h2>6.4.7_p3</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.7_p3">Transformation is also more than a single instance of institutional change. Historical perspectives on transformation enable an understanding of the chain of institutional changes that ultimately lead to significant or far-reaching reconfiguration of infrastructure and service provision (Rojas et al, 2015). Paradigm changes, such as new engagements with nature and green infrastructure, will improve adaptation outcomes (Roberts <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2012). Changes of paradigms, however, are not inherently positive and may clash with existing interests or involve trade-offs with other priorities. When care is taken to ensure greater inclusion in urban decision-making, disadvantaged, vulnerable communities are less likely to be disadvantaged. For example, indigenous traditions of nature management provide entry points for the sustainable management of resources, such as seed banks, urban agriculture and the local management of watersheds and floods, may be at odds with conventional structures of expert knowledge (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cid-Aguayo--2016">Cid-Aguayo, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chandra--2016">Chandra and Gaganis, 2016</a>).

While community led resilience agendas may tackle poverty related issues, they struggle to tackle city-wide structural forms of inequality (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018). Processes of shared learning and co-production of knowledge can reinforce existing power dynamics and be limited by technical framings of vulnerability that marginalise political issues (Orleans Reed <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2013). These issues are especially acute in relation to land use decisions where short-term fiscal and commercial interests conflict with long-term vulnerability reduction objectives (Brown, Dayal and Rumbaitis Del Rio, 2012). It can be difficult for adaptation actions to target cities&#8217; underlying political&#8211;economic structure, such as entrenched political&#8211;economic interests, elite influence over decision making or neoliberal planning logics that maintain and reproduce inequality (Chu, Anguelovski and Roberts, 2017). Urban resilience plans may be formulated in disconnection from broader development strategies, which leads to a limited ability to tackle underlying structures of political power and urban development practices (<a class="reference-link" href="#Weinstein--2019">Weinstein et al., 2019</a>). Evidence from Kolkata demonstrates the limitations of resilience plans to address underlying conditions of vulnerability, including the commodification of hazardous land, under-provision of informal settlements and spatial segregation of the urban poor (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rumbach--2017">Rumbach, 2017</a>).</p></li><li><h2>6.4.7_p5</h2><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="6.4.7_p5">Planning for transformative adaptation is more <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> where communities can learn collectively (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement </span>) (Restemeyer, van den Brink and Woltjer, 2017; Kabisch <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Fraser <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2017; Putri, Dalimunthe and Prasojo). Greater citizen engagement facilitates implementing specific measures for radical policymaking or the mainstreaming of environmental knowledge into adaptation practices (Reed et al, 2015). Do it yourself (DIY) planning, in which stakeholders focus on creating and improving specific urban spaces they inhabit, has led to urban greening experiments led by civil society that change paradigms of urban and environmental management (Cloutier, Papin and Bizier, 2018). Social learning may occur through combinations of activism and collaboration with and between informal settlement dwellers, as shown in adaptation experiences in informal settlements in Hanoi and Bangkok (Dani&#232;re <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> et al., 2016).. The adaptation process can benefit from the inclusion of multiple sources of knowledge for social learning, including universities but also communities and citizens (Chu, Schenk and Patterson, 2018).

That is why care needs to be taken to ensure climate adaptation planning and development of new infrastructure does not exacerbate inequality or negatively impact other sustainable development priorities. Climate adaptation planning is most effective when it is sensitive to the diverse ways that low-income and minority communities are more <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> to experience climate risk, including women, children, migrants, refugees, internally displaced peoples and racial/ethnic minority groups, among others.</p></li><li><h2>references_p1</h2><p class="References_References_body" id="references_p1" lang="en-GB">Abatzoglou, J.T. and A.P.
