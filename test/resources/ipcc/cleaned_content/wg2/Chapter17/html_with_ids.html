Climate risk decision-making focuses on the processes needed to identify and characterise those risks as well as generate plans and policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks (derived from the definition of risk and risk management in Chapter 1). This chapter presents an assessment of the evidence on climate risk decision-making as a set of processes that involve a range of actors in different contexts resulting in diverse outcomes. The climate risk decision makers and their actions are the central focus of the assessment. The chapter is an assessment of the evidence of the decision-making options that are available in practice, and functions as a central pivot point between the identification of key climate risks (Chapter 16) and the means to integrate and leverage action on climate risk decision-making into the broader requirements of climate resilient development pathways (Chapter 18). This section introduces the main entry points on decision-making that have framed this assessment (Sections 17.1.1.1–17.1.1.5), as well as the key terms used to frame this assessment and its organisation in this chapter (<a class="section-link" data-title="Objectives and Key Terms" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.1.2">Section 17.1.2</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.1.1_p2">A central framing point is the connection between climate risk decision-making and adaptation. Adaptation for human systems in this report is introduced in <a class="section-link" data-title="Point of Departure and Key Concepts" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-1">Chapter 1</a> and defined in the Glossary as ‘the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities’. In natural systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects (see IPCC 6th Assessment Report [AR6] Glossary [Annex II]). In this chapter, we consider adaptations that may be implemented by people, whether they be to support human, managed, or natural systems, and the processes and factors that underpin adaptation in these diverse settings. Different types of adaptation have been distinguished in Chapter 1, including anticipatory versus reactive, autonomous versus planned, and incremental versus transformational (IPCC WGII glossaries; Chapters 16–18). These dichotomies and interactions are assessed here. Implementation of adaptation through iterative risk management decision-making emphasises that anticipating and responding to climate change does not consist of a single set of judgements at a single point in time, but rather an ongoing cycle of assessment, action, reassessment, learn and response (Chapter 1).</p><div class="h3-container" id="17.1.1.1"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">17.1.1.1 Decision-Making for Managing Climate Risks in AR6<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-1-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.1.1.1_p1">The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Climate Agreement, the UN Sendai Framework Disaster Risk Reduction and the UN Habitat New Urban Agenda, helped push climate risk management and adaptation forward from the global to the national level, from the planning stage into implementation, and provide benchmarks for adaptation progress. To assess adaptation progress (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Success and Maladaptation, Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.5">Section 17.5</a>), the interplay between top-down (institutional) and bottom-up (individual/social/community) processes, multi-scale interaction (local, regional, national and international), iterative risk management, differing forms of knowledge, and equity are especially crucial (particularly Sections 17.2, 17.4). Parallel to these advances is an understanding and assessment of appropriate decision support tools, methods and evaluation metrics (<a class="section-link" data-title="Decision-Making Processes of Risk Management and Adaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.3">Section 17.3</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.1.1.1_p2">Since AR5, significant advances have been made in regard to the understanding of the drivers of decision-making and contexts in which climate risk decision-making takes place. Climate risk decision-making generally, and adaptation specifically, has been a focus within the IPCC special reports in the sixth assessment cycle. An overall goal of climate risk management is to eliminate or reduce the risk to levels that are socio-politically and economically acceptable. Risk management to an acceptable level may not be feasible because of limits or barriers to adaptation. Future potential risks are a more complex matter given the need to define time scales and spatial extent, and uncertainties. In the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018a">IPCC, 2018a</a>), the risks associated with climate-related impacts were found to be higher under emission scenarios above 1.5°C, raising awareness for the need to limit the impacts of warming through the acceleration of climate mitigation and both incremental and transformational adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018a">IPCC, 2018a</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.1.1.1_p3">The AR6 IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>) added the dimensions of pace, intensity and scale of climate impacts and adaptation or mitigation responses and adverse consequences.

The IPCC SRCCL placed emphasis on acknowledging co-benefits and trade-offs to avoid barriers to implementation, with particular attention to land use decisions. It states that this coordination can be supported by building networks of decision makers across scales and sectors, including local stakeholders from vulnerable groups, and by adopting and implementing policies in a flexible and iterative manner (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="17.1.1.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">17.1.1.2 Approaches to Assess and Synthesise Options for Managing Risk <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-2-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.1.1.2_p1">This chapter utilises several points of departure to assess climate risk management that emerge from AR5 and AR6, specifically.

These works provide foundational assessment of evidence on decision-making systems that connect different spatial and temporal scales and diverse cultural contexts in which climate risk management takes place, the varying interactions of decision makers and their stakeholder groups, and the barriers and enablers to decision-making, including governance, finance and knowledge (<a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling and Catalysing Conditions for Adaptation and Risk Management" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.4">Section 17.4</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.1.1.2_p2">Another significant advance is that, instead of cataloguing decision-making strategies, the literature has now evolved to the point where adaptation progress, effectiveness and efficiency can be more meaningfully assessed through increased monitoring and evaluation capacity, although the ability to measure success and effectiveness is not fully developed and is hampered by lack of data, agreed methods and terms, and time to fully evaluate adaptation actions (see Sections 17.3.3 and 17.5, Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in this Chapter). The ambition to describe effectiveness and success illustrates further maturation of the literature on climate risk decision-making as a system process. Overall, the process of climate risk decision-making remains dynamic, and the chapter attempts to assess a variety of proactive management approaches being developed and tested to address adverse, diverse and complex risks in a wide range of developing and developed country contexts (Figure 17.1). The chapter provides a synthesis of how these new approaches are reflected in the sectoral and regional chapters and cross-chapter papers of this report (Chapters 2–15; Cross-Chapter Papers 1–7). Specifically, the goal is to provide a line of sight between the sectoral and regional chapters and cross-chapter papers’ decision-making assessment to sections in this chapter.

Climate risk decision-making as an object of study has emerged in a more central location within the literature as adaptation moves from planning into the realm of practice. The broad sense of urgency (summarised in <a class="reference-link" href="#Wilson--2019">Wilson and Orlove, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wilson--2021">Wilson and Orlove, 2021</a>) shows growth of the term ‘urgency’ in both scholarly publications and the popular press since 2014, building on earlier increases starting around 2005, and a dramatic spike of the terms ‘climate crisis’ and ‘climate emergency’. Paralleling this call for more extensive and rapid action is the emergence of the term ‘transformational’ adaptation and decision-making. Transformational adaptation (defined and deeply examined in Chapters 1 and 16 and <a class="section-link" data-title="Risk Management and Adaptation Options" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.2">Section 17.2</a>) highlights efforts that involve large-scale, systemic change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wilson--2020">Wilson et al., 2020</a>) and involves ‘adapting to climate change resulting in significant changes in structure or function that go beyond adjusting existing practices including approaches that enable new ways of decision-making on adaptation’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018a">IPCC, 2018a</a>).

Enablers are positively associated with likelihood that adaptation planning occurs, and strategies will be put into practice. Three broad enabling conditions are presented in the chapter (<a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling and Catalysing Conditions for Adaptation and Risk Management" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.4">Section 17.4</a>): governance (legislation, regulation, institutions, litigation), finance (needs, sources, intermediaries, instruments flows, equity) and knowledge (capacities, climate services, big data, Indigenous/local knowledge, co-production, boundary organisations).

Different types of risk (e.g., gradual compared with catastrophic) and conditions of risk (e.g., known versus uncertain) are associated with different types of responses (e.g., incremental versus transformational). As the risk decision process proceeds, individuals and organisations will formally or informally utilise any number of mechanisms to guide, aid or facilitate the decision-making process.

Decision-making is considered to be a reflexive and recursive process where different evidentiary threads and information inputs become relevant to the understanding and assessment of factors underlying specific decisions. Additionally, this is also a discursive process, whereby actors and institutions’ interpretations of climate risks are also key to these deliberations.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.1.3_p2">Decision-making processes of risk management and adaptation are varied and numerous. <a class="section-link" data-title="Risk Management and Adaptation Options" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.2">Section 17.2</a> assesses the risk management and adaptation options already in practice. <a class="section-link" data-title="Decision-Making Processes of Risk Management and Adaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.3">Section 17.3</a> assesses decision-support methods and tools available for application and the effectiveness of these in supporting climate decision-making across degrees of uncertainties and levels of governance and expected reach (scale) across populations from households to international cooperation.

Here, M&amp;E is considered distinct from the tracking of financial flows related to adaptation, given that financial accounting does not necessarily provide information on the implementation of adaptation measures and their results (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Governance of Adaptation Options" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.2.1.2">Section 17.2.1.2</a>).

It depends on who evaluates adaptation and at what time as well as on the ability to compare the outcome of adaptation with a hypothetical situation without adaptation and without other parallel changes, such as development interventions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Singh--2021">Singh et al., 2021</a>; Dilling et al., 2019). The ability to compare the risk situation post and prior adaptation is complicated through the long time horizons at which adaptation outcomes often become apparent (Cross-Chapter Box ADAPT in Chapter 1; <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Success and Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.5.1">Section 17.5.1</a>; Dilling et al., 2019).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-17.1_p2">However, a wealth of information has recently become available on how success and effectiveness of adaptation could be assessed, defined or investigated in certain settings (Patt and Schröter, 2008; Morecroft Michael et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tubi--2021">Tubi and Williams, 2021</a>) or across a larger set of adaptations (Hegger et al., 2012; <a class="reference-link" href="#Eriksen--2015">Eriksen et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gajjar--2019a">Gajjar et al., 2019a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Owen--2020">Owen, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Singh--2021">Singh et al., 2021</a>). Accordingly, successful adaptation is understood as effective adaptation, in that it reduces climate impacts, vulnerabilities and risk, and additionally balances synergies and trade-offs across diverse objectives, perspectives, expectations and values (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eriksen--2015">Eriksen et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Juhola--2016">Juhola et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gajjar--2019a">Gajjar et al., 2019a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Owen--2020">Owen, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Singh--2021">Singh et al., 2021</a>). Across this report, four factors are identified as enabling conditions of successful adaptation, which include a focus on recognitional, procedural and distributional justice as well as flexible and strong institutions that seek policy integration and account for long-term goals.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-17.1_p3">To operationalize ‘success’ in this chapter, it is characterised by the degree to which an adaptation response benefits (1) human systems (number of people), (2) ecosystems or ecosystem services, (3) marginalised ethnic groups, (4) women and girls, (5) and low-income populations, and can be characterised as (6) transformational adaptation, and (7) contributing to greenhouse gas emission reductions (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Success and Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.5.1">Section 17.5.1</a>). Overarching to these factors are uncertainty and potential path dependency of decisions that may result in lock-in and maladaptation in the long term, and recognition that what is successful in the near term is not necessarily successful in the long term.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-17.1_p4">Success in adaptation is antithetical to maladaptation. Maladaptation refers to current or potential future negative consequences, including failed or partially successful adaptation (or risk reduction) but also trade-offs or side effects of adaptation (see Glossary, Annex II). Thus, success of adaptation and maladaptation form the ends of a continuum that represents the balancing of synergies and trade-offs across regions, populations or sectors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Singh--2016">Singh et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Magnan--2020">Magnan et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schipper--2020">Schipper, 2020</a>). Every adaptation action may be placed along such a continuum reflecting the empirical evidence of adaptation practices and their assessment (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Success and Maladaptation, Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.5">Section 17.5</a>).</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="17.2"><h1 class="Headings_H1-numbered" lang="en-GB">17.2 Risk Management and Adaptation Options </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-3-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.2_p1">There has been substantial progress in risk management and adaptation responses around the world, as demonstrated in the sectoral and regional chapters of this report and illustrated in Chapter 16. This section presents an overview of different options available to manage risk, explaining how they are currently governed and the extent to which they can be applied around the world. The section contains an assessment of the ways in which different options are being combined to create adaptation portfolios, and describes how incremental and transformational change is starting to be considered. Based on the human dimension of climate change, as described in Chapter 8, vulnerability, inequality and poverty influence these portfolios of adaptation and transformational change. Particularly for change where residual risks remain that may lead to exceeding the limits of adaptation, increasingly transformational adaptation and policy innovation will be important. <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Options for Climate Risk Management" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.2.1">Section 17.2.1</a> assesses options for climate risk management from around the world that reduce, manage or retain climate-related risks and assesses their contribution to reducing vulnerability and exposure, how they are governed, and the benefits to humans and ecosystems. <a class="section-link" data-title="Combining Adaptation Options: Portfolios of Risk Management and Risk Governance" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.2.2">Section 17.2.2</a> presents portfolios of risk management, including the design principles and observed variations across the globe, before it discusses the need and potential for transformational adaptation to complement incremental adaptation, for which we present evidence across the report for selected adaptation options and some key risks.

These risk management and adaptation actions target the components of risk: hazards, vulnerabilities and exposure associated with sudden or slow-onset events (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Point of Departure and Key Concepts" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-1">Chapter 1</a> for more details on the definition of risk).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.2.1_p2">For each of the RKRs, three commonly discussed adaptation options are identified across the regional, sectoral and cross-chapter papers of this report. These 24 options have been selected to cover a representative variety of strategies to adapt to climate change, while a particular adaptation option can be relevant to many of the RKRs. For example, the adaptations listed under the RKR of ‘Food security’ are also related to the RKR on ‘Human health’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ebi--2015">Ebi and Prats, 2015</a>). See SM17.1 for more detail. The list is not comprehensive of all possible adaptations listed in the regional and sectoral chapters.

Vulnerability is the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Point of Departure and Key Concepts" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-1">Chapter 1</a> for more details). In the world’s threatened ecosystems, reducing vulnerability often means reducing other non-climate negative pressures on ecosystems, such as pesticide use or fishery overexploitation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Linking Biological Responses to Climate-induced Drivers" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-3#3.3">Section 3.3</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.2.1.1_p3">Vulnerability reduction is also a major focus in human systems, and this includes development of investments that help people adapt to climate change. Examples include irrigation or diversifying crops. Building infrastructure resilient to climate-related risks is another example; many of the structural and physical adaptation options can reduce sensitivity to disasters, such as elevating houses or doing beach nourishment in coastal areas (<a class="section-link" data-title="Assessment of Adaptation Options and Their Implementation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-15#15.5">Section 15.5</a>). Extreme events often catalyse investment in adaptation to reduce vulnerability for the future (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kreibich--2017">Kreibich et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Slav%C3%ADkov%C3%A1--2021">Slavíková et al., 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.2.1.1_p4">Next to vulnerability reduction, a large number of adaptation options focus on reducing exposure to climate change (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Selecting low-risk locations is the most basic example of reducing exposure; for example, private companies are relocating factories to reduce flood-related disruptions to their supply chain (<a class="reference-link" href="#Neise--2019">Neise and Revilla Diez, 2019</a>), and species are autonomously adjusting their ranges to a changing climate (<a class="section-link" data-title="Observed Impacts of Climate Change on Species, Communities, Biomes, Key Ecosystems and Their Services" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.4">Section 2.4</a>). Land use planning or investing in resilient infrastructure can avoid exposure in rapidly urbanising areas; however, the design and enforcement of these regulations can negatively impact marginalised people (<a class="reference-link" href="#Anguelovski--2016">Anguelovski et al., 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.2.1.1_p5">Managed retreat is an example of exposure reduction that, while often controversial, is increasingly being considered and implemented (CCP 2.2.2, <a class="section-link" data-title="Observed Impacts and Projected Risks on Human Systems" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-15#15.3.4">Section 15.3.4</a>; Cross-Chapter Box LOSS in this Chapter; <a class="reference-link" href="#Siders--2019">Siders et al., 2019</a>).

While ‘hard’ structural investments have been popular to reduce exposure to climate extremes, barrier-type measures provide protection only up to a certain limit, and are designed to fail in more extreme events.

In rapidly urbanising areas of Asia and Africa, individual- or community-led adaptation is the norm in informal settlements that have poor governance structures.

This is in addition to risk reduction measures such as building structures to withstand rising water levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Thorn--2015">Thorn et al., 2015</a>).

In higher-income contexts, this is often more feasible than in contexts with limited resources, and adaptation investments are more likely to include structural measures to reduce exposure, complemented by vulnerability-reducing measures and insurance protection (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>). While this typology is not universally representative of high-income areas (within or between countries), expensive exposure-reduction measures tend to be easier to implement in high-income countries. For example, flood protection is largest in countries with larger amounts of public spending and least amounts of corruption (<a class="reference-link" href="#Scussolini--2016">Scussolini et al., 2016</a>). It is seen as more economically efficient to invest in expensive protection measures in wealthy regions, under different scenarios of sea level rise and river flooding, although these calculations have equity and justice implications (<a class="reference-link" href="#Peduzzi--2017">Peduzzi, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lincke--2018">Lincke and Hinkel, 2018</a>). After flood events happen in regions with high levels of protection, damages are comparatively limited, and people tend to continue living in close proximity to the protected river (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mard--2018">Mard et al., 2018</a>).

In Europe, several national adaptation plans include planning for potential benefits of a changing climate, including reduced winter mortality and improved conditions for hydropower (<a class="reference-link" href="#Biesbroek--2010">Biesbroek et al., 2010</a>). Recognising the need for economic diversification, people working in certain industries, such as coastal management, perceive climate change as a factor increasing the need for their services (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fatori%C4%87--2017">Fatorić et al., 2017</a>).

The following section identifies how the 24 adaptation options representative of the RKRs may support incremental and transformational risk management/adaptation that can lead to small, medium and large systemic change, often as part of portfolios of options. This subsection further discusses the role of transformational adaptation vis á vis incremental adaptation by reviewing evidence across chapters (see also Box 17.3). The Cross Chapter Box on Loss and Damage further expands on the international debate regarding the role of decision-making on incremental and transformational adaptation for dealing with residual risks to address soft as well as hard adaptation limits (see Cross-Chapter Box LOSS in this Chapter).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.2.2.4_p2">As the literature distinguishes active transformation to shape future risks from passive and unintended transformation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lonsdale--2015">Lonsdale et al., 2015</a>; Chapter 1), the section queries how to inspire actors to consider how to develop or implement transformational adaptation to complement incremental adaptation/risk management when and where appropriate.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.2.2.4_p3">In contrast to a broadening literature on conceptualisation and policy proposal, there has been little evidence reported in the literature on transformational adaptation and risk management at scale of implementation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Klein--2017">Klein et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ajibade--2019">Ajibade and Egge, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#T%C3%A0bara--2019">Tàbara et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mechler--2021">Mechler and Deubelli, 2021</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Deubelli--2021">Deubelli and Venkateswaran (2021)</a> review evidence on largely non-governmental organisation (NGO)-implemented community-level adaptation for floods, heat and drought across the globe. They suggest that transformational adaptation success, while multi-facetted and challenging, depends on the availability of appropriate enabling environments including experiential and niche learning, alignment of transformational change objectives with strategic (government or other actor’s) priorities, strong bottom-up governance grounded in local contexts, phased long-term program support and appropriate financing.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.2.2.4_p4">To distinguish incremental from transformational adaptation, Lonsdale et al. (2015), building on <a class="reference-link" href="#Mustelin--2013">Mustelin and Handmer (2013)</a>, identify criteria related to framing, learning and decision-making, space and time, power, and type of change management. <a class="reference-link" href="#T%C3%A0bara--2019">Tàbara et al. (2019)</a>, additionally discuss transformation in light of informing climate pathways, strategies and solutions. Broadly considering these criteria, they identify 12 dimensions with additional discussion of change with regard to systems and dynamics, options and solutions, agency, and the consideration of equity (see also Chapters 1, 6, 18 for more discussion). In particular, the following key aspects for understanding the spectrum from incremental to transformational adaptation are of relevance: change, within or across the system; agency, single or heterogenous; a role for visioning and normative futures; the type of learning required (from first order, business-as-usual, to second order); and how equity and distributional issues are explicit.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.2.2.4_p5">Applying these key aspects to the list of 24 adaptation options from Table 17.1, certain options are assessed to be more transformational, often requiring large system changes that go beyond addressing individual risks. Adaptations that are more transformational offer potential to lead to systemic change. Less transformational adaptations allow people to address specific climate-related risks while maintaining existing systems (see SM17.1 for more details; see also Box 17.3).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.2.2.4_p6">For example, several adaptations related to the RKR on risks to peace and migration, namely permanent migration, and cooperative governance, require moderate to high levels of transformation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Some behavioural adaptations, such as changing diets and reducing food waste, can also require large transformations in land use and food culture (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>). Spatial planning, including urban zoning, also tends to be more transformational (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.2.2.4_p7">On the other end of the spectrum, disaster early-warning systems tend to be incremental rather than transformational (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>), because they enable people to maintain/protect existing systems. Several other adaptations allow people to maintain livelihoods and systems in the face of changing risks. For example, improvements in agricultural and fishing practices can be done with moderate transformation to systems (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>). Similarly, insurance tends to require less transformation, as it can allow people to maintain existing systems while being more resilient to climate-related shocks (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.2.2.4_p8">None of the 24 adaptation options are consistently beneficial for vulnerable and marginalised groups (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). For each adaptation, there are examples of how it has been implemented in a way that benefits poor, low-income, ethnic groups and/or females, and other examples of implementation in different contexts that have worsened the risks for those groups specifically. For example, while the goal of cooperative governance can be to support the marginalised, these same marginalised groups are usually excluded from participating in the design of the solutions, and many articles criticise governance results as protecting only the interests of the wealthier and more powerful parties in the negotiations, especially in governance of migration (<a class="reference-link" href="#Groutsis--2015">Groutsis et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pijnenburg--2018">Pijnenburg et al., 2018</a>).

Regulations and standards for climate action emerge primarily from two settings: first, as an addition or augmentation to existing regulations and standards that emerged initially to address existing potential climate extremes and stresses (e.g., size of culverts in response to maximum rainfall and runoff conditions); and second, new regulations and standards that were developed in direct response to new or emergent climate risks (e.g., regulations in response to new presence of mean monthly high tide flooding) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Qiao--2018">Qiao et al., 2018</a>).

Environmental and social governance enables the testing and definition of implementation solutions, enhancing the opportunities for defining successful adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Surminski--2013">Surminski, 2013</a>). Several models and approaches to adaptive governance to promote adaptation and resilience in response to extreme weather events have been observed.

In summary, they find that analyses of the effects of voluntary pressure demonstrate that by themselves they are unlikely to bring about significant improvement in environmental outcomes. Professional organisations, however, have made progress in addressing sectoral standards relative to the adaptation process. This includes the development of new industry guidelines, codes, standards and specifications, in addition to the implementation of infrastructure inventories that incorporate evaluation of vulnerabilities and identification of priority at-risk areas (Chapter 14). Voluntary pressures by themselves are not likely to result in positive outcomes and instead should be coupled with mandatory regulatory pressure to achieve the environmental response desired (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bianco--2020">Bianco, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.4.2.1.5_p5">Since AR5, another key development in environmental and social governance has been the establishment of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which aimed to develop guidelines for companies to voluntarily report the financial implications of two broad categories of climate risk: the transition risks of shifting to a lower-carbon economy and the physical risks of climate change itself (<a class="reference-link" href="#TCFD--2017">TCFD, 2017</a>).

The same analysis also noted that: (i) the total of estimates of assets at risk were two orders of magnitude lower than generally accepted estimates of total financial risk; (ii) a minority of companies consider risks outside of their own operations or in their value chains; (iii) most underestimate or do not estimate the costs of adaptation; and (iv) many assume linear impacts and responses, neglecting the potential for tipping points or acceleration in risk and potentially transformative adaptation requirements. At this stage, TCFD has influenced many companies’ thinking and comprehension of physical climate risk, but it appears too early to assess whether this has driven substantive responses to manage these risks.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="17.4.3"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">17.4.3 Enabling Condition 2: Finance <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-10-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.4.3_p1">Finance has long been recognised as an important enabling and catalysing factor for adaptation, climate resilient development and climate risk management.

One strand of this discussion emphasises the distinctiveness of different knowledge systems, often focusing on three types of knowledge: scientific, Indigenous and local, and the latter are two sometimes grouped as ‘traditional’ knowledge (see Cross-Chapter Box INDIG in Chapter 18). This strand emphasises the specific forms of knowledge production and circulation in each type. Another strand of discussion emphasises the networks of interactions between different groups. This strand follows the influential ‘Knowledge systems for sustainable development’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cash--2003">Cash et al., 2003</a>), which was cited in Chapters 2, 7 and 8 in WGII AR5; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cash--2003">Cash et al.

Also important are two other components of knowledge: of response options and knowledge of other enabling conditions, particularly governance and finance, which were mentioned less frequently and more indirectly in AR5 and SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL.

Public finance is provided by national and sub-national governments and distributed directly by government or intermediaries such as development finance institutions and climate funds, either nationally or internationally. Private finance comes from five main sources: commercial financial institutions (banks), institutional investors (including asset managers, insurance companies and pension funds), other private equity (venture capital and infrastructure funds), non-financial corporations such as renewable energy or water companies, and individual households and communities. Across these different sources, the main instruments used are grants, concessional debt, market debt, internal budget allocation, insurance, as well as personal savings in households (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Public and private sources of funding can be blended into a single instrument, for example for insurance where public funds provide capital for both sovereign catastrophe instruments and micro-insurance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jarzabkowski--2019">Jarzabkowski et al., 2019</a>) or for concessional loans.

Though enabling conditions are necessary pre-conditions that allow response options to be formulated and implemented, their presence alone does not guarantee that these response options will occur in a timely fashion or at a scale commensurate with the risk, or even that they will occur at all. Catalysing conditions address this deficit in advancing action. They serve to overcome the inertia that often operates as a barrier to action and motivate individuals and organisations to initiate or accelerate action. Different forms of catalysing conditions, described below, lead individuals and organisations to weigh more seriously the costs of delaying action or keeping action at low levels. Catalysing conditions focus the attention of individuals and organisations on particular risks, leading actors to augment their decision-making processes and to allocate financial and social resources to respond to those risks. This attention and deliberation can lead to more frequent and potentially substantial adaptations, whether through more extensive action on existing forms of adaptation or through the adoption of entirely new adaptations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bolorinos--2020">Bolorinos et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.4.5_p2">The first two catalysing conditions described below address the costs of delaying action. Urgency increases the awareness of individuals and organisations of such costs, while windows of opportunity, including extreme events, are time-bound periods during which certain actions are possible, but after which they are more difficult or impossible.

Litigation over adaptation issues, for example, can open new lines of action or close off old ones, while catalysing agents advance action through a variety of means (e.g., communicating the urgency of climate action, revising agendas for action, expanding coalitions which undertake action).

All the experimental papers and all but three of the observational papers provide support for an inverted U-shaped relationship between urgency and response intensity (including motivation and action), with higher levels of response at intermediate levels of urgency and lower levels of response at low or high levels of urgency (Figure 17.9).

First, greater levels of response to climate change-induced challenges can be motivated by communication strategies that move decision makers from low to moderate levels of urgency (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). In the case of drought, a number of studies show that urgent messages promote water conservation, especially when these messages are repeated, perceived as trustworthy and linked to concrete suggestions for action (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gonzales--2017">Gonzales and Ajami, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Joubert--2019">Joubert and </a><a class="reference-link" href="#Ziervogel--2019">Ziervogel, 2019</a> ; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kam--2019">Kam et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Booysen--2019a">Booysen et al., 2019a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Booysen--2019b">Booysen et al., 2019b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bolorinos--2020">Bolorinos et al., 2020</a>).

Given that climate decision makers in many regions and sectors are experiencing greater pressure to act, this finding suggests the existence of windows for planning and action during which climate risks have led to moderate levels of urgency, but before these risks have resulted in urgency exceeding some upper threshold (<a class="section-link" data-title="Windows of Opportunity" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.4.5.2">Section 17.4.5.2</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.4.5.1_p5">In addition, these studies point to potential weaknesses as well as strengths in strategic communication to modulate urgency.

This is also shown by the wide confidence ranges of most options (right panel) signifying that most adaptation can be done in a way that involves a higher or a lower risk of maladaptation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>; see also Figure 17.3). The option of ‘coastal infrastructure’ signifies the highest risk for maladaptation. While it can be an efficient adaptation option in highly densely populated areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2019">Oppenheimer et al., 2019</a>; <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation in Cities and Settlements by the Sea" href="/chapter/17#CCP2.3">CCP2.3</a>), it has potential trade-offs for natural system functioning and human vulnerability over time.

It assesses the potential contribution of each of these adaptation options to successful adaptation and the risk of maladaptation. The figure permits a review of options in multiple ways: (a) looking at adaptation options (first column), one can see which adaptation options score highest across the criteria (the central rows). Results by options show which ones carry the highest risk of maladaptation (largest circles per row); (b): looking at criteria (top centre), one can see which criteria seem to be most influential to contribute to maladaptation outcomes (largest circles per central column); (c) panel on the right: merging the scores of each adaptation option across criteria helps highlight whether the options are likely to end up as successful adaptation or maladaptation.</p></div><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.5.1.1.2_p4">Some options show the dominant influence of certain criteria (Figure 17.11, central panel rows). For example, ‘availability of health infrastructure’ and ‘access to health care’ are dominated by the criterion ‘greenhouse gas emissions’. Similarly, ‘spatial planning’ carries a high risk of disadvantages to marginalised ethnic and low-income groups. This means that these adaptations could be transformed into successful adaptations more easily than others, if attention is paid to the dominant criterion. For example, if health care could be provided with low GHG emissions, it would move closer towards successful adaptation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). For other options, the criteria’s influence is more evenly distributed, as illustrated for the ‘diversification of livelihoods’ and the three options to address climate risks to peace and mobility, denoting multiple entry points to reduce the risk of maladaptive outcomes for these options.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.5.1.1.2_p5">Some criteria score highly across a number of options (Figure 17.11, central panel columns), showing that many adaptations do not pay attention to different trade-offs. For example, particular attention should be paid to prioritising benefits to low-income groups and leveraging the transformational potential of adaptation (having the largest number of large circles), that is, many evaluated options become maladaptive by exacerbating the vulnerability of low-income groups and by fortifying the status quo (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>). On the contrary, most evaluated adaptation options are widely applicable across populations (benefits to humans) and deliver ecosystem services, while some also respect gender equity (largest number of small bubbles across options). Through these criteria, a number of adaptation options contribute to a higher potential for successful adaptation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.5.1.1.2_p6">The results displayed in Figure 17.11 are not rigorous predictions but illustrate the maladaptive potential of options based on a synthesis of literature from underlying WGII chapters and cross-chapter papers. This leads to findings for general situations, potentially obscuring critical contextual specificities which can mediate successful adaptation or maladaptation outcomes. In a certain context, Figure 17.11 will appear different. Moreover, the analysis is based on a static interpretation of adaptation outcomes, while risk and risk reduction are dynamic. The current, underlying literature does not help understanding the temporal dimension of the options, their flexibility or risk of lock-in, and related potential contribution to long-term maladaptation or successful adaptation. The added value of the analysis lies in the approach to assess the potential contribution to maladaptation or successful adaptation (via the seven criteria at the top of the figure), rather than in the final results themselves. This overview illustrates how, in a particular context and for particular groups of people, adaptation options and their location on the adaptation–maladaptation continuum can be assessed for a set of outcome dimensions, focusing on assessing potential contributions per and across criteria as well as per and across options (critical information to support the identification of adaptation pathways; Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in this Chapter).</p></div></div><div class="h4-container" id="17.5.1.1.3"><h4 class="Headings_H4" lang="de-DE">17.5.1.1.3 Enabling successful adaptation and pre-empting maladaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h4><div class="h4-siblings" id="h4-22-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.5.1.1.3_p1">Considering evidence on enabling successful adaptation in the sectoral (Chapters 2–8) and regional chapters (Chapters 9–15), four conditions stand out as particularly key to enabling adaptation success: recognitional equity and justice, including the integration of Indigenous and local communities and knowledge; procedural equity and justice; distributive equity and justice; and flexible and strong institutions that seek integration of climate risk management with other policies and address long-term risk reduction goals (Table 17.7).

Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) is the systematic process of collecting, analysing and using information to assess the progress of adaptation and evaluate its effects—for example, risk reduction outcomes, co-benefits and trade-offs—mostly during and after implementation (AR6 Glossary, Annex II). Distinctions between monitoring and evaluation typically view monitoring as a continuous process of tracking implementation and informing management to allow for corrective action including in situations of deep uncertainty (see Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in this Chapter), while evaluation is described as a more comprehensive assessment of achievements, unintended effects and lessons learned carried out at certain point in time (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2002">OECD, 2002</a>).

It can indicate how much is being spent on adaptation, where funds are going to and whether spending matches allocated budgets. Thus, adaptation finance tracking can provide useful information for decision-making, but it does not provide information on the achievements resulting from the invested funds. Accordingly, it can complement, but not substitute, M&amp;E of actions and outcomes. Adaptation finance tracking can be applied domestically (<a class="reference-link" href="#Guzm%C3%A1n--2017">Guzmán et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Guzm%C3%A1n--2018">Guzmán et al., 2018</a>) as well as internationally, for instance by developed countries to report on the goal to mobilise USD 100 billion yr <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>−1</span> by 2020 in climate finance (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC%20SCF--2018">UNFCCC SCF, 2018</a>).

A further challenge is how to account for adaptation that is mainstreamed, that is, where adaptation-specific investments form only part of a larger programme or budget line, or where actions contribute to adaptation without being labelled as adaptation. These challenges limit the direct comparability between adaptation and mitigation finance (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2019a">UNFCCC, 2019a</a>). In fact, tracking adaptation finance differs from tracking mitigation finance since activities cannot be <span class="condensed_italic" lang>a priori</span> assumed to constitute adaptation but instead have to be assessed for their linkage to climate risks in a particular context (MDBs &amp; IDFC, 2018).

One of the differences concerns the treatment of partially adaptation-relevant projects, namely whether only parts or the full amount of a given project volume are counted as adaptation finance (see, e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#MDBs--2019">MDBs, 2019</a>). Under the OECD DAC methodology, countries often use a fixed percentage (e.g., 50% of the total project value), whereas the MDB methodology attempts for a project-specific estimation of the adaptation-relevant proportion (MDBs &amp; IDFC, 2018). Another aspect is whether tracking distinguishes between financial instruments, such as grants or loans. Different accounting rules can lead to large differences in reported amounts of adaptation finance and to a lack of comparability between providers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Weikmans--2019">Weikmans and Roberts, 2019</a>). Studies identified an over-reporting (i.e., counting non-adaptation-related finance) by a factor of two to three, which suggests the need for a more consistent and transparent accounting system (<a class="reference-link" href="#Weikmans--2017">Weikmans et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#CARE--2021">CARE, 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="17.5.2.6_p4">Good coverage of adaptation finance data exists around international public finance flows, predominantly official development assistance flows from OECD DAC members and from multi-lateral development banks.

Important considerations for a robust assessment framework (e.g., consistency), as well as the associated scientific challenges (e.g., aggregation, externalities, breadth versus depth of data) and the role of underlying objectives (e.g., on the contested issue of comparability) are increasingly understood (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). There is also a growing and diverse body of information on adaptation progress, although most assessments of global progress undertaken to date focus on processes and outputs (e.g., policies and plans) rather than outcomes (i.e., risk reduction). A variety of approaches and data sources are employed, such as systematic reviews of observed adaptation, formal communications by Parties to the UNFCCC, and project documents to international funding agencies. Novel approaches, including big data tools (Ford et al., 2016; Biesbroek et al., 2020), are also being explored but still have to prove their practical value. Each approach and source of information can contribute additional knowledge, but also demonstrates limitations, so that there is no single ‘best’ approach (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Yet, to date, the international community has not sufficiently explored the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and their applicability and, therefore, their potential synergies in complementing each other. Triangulated assessments have only rarely been applied (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) due to multiple conceptual and methodological challenges, despite their potential for increasing the robustness of knowledge. One overarching conclusion of this Cross-Chapter Box therefore is that the combination of different approaches will provide a more comprehensive picture of global adaptation progress than is currently available from individual approaches (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>).</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1"><div class="Box_Header-continued" id="_idContainer058"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_continued-subhead" lang="en-GB">Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-17.4"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 17.4 | The Rio Markers Methodology to Track Climate Finance</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-25-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-17.4_p1">The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) introduced a methodology to track the amount of bilateral official development assistance (ODA) that is targeting climate change mitigation and/or adaptation.

The associated project value is counted in full, in part, or not counted as adaptation finance, respectively. Countries count the volume of partial adaptation projects (score ‘1’) to a different extent, which limits comparability and can lead to over-reporting (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2019">OECD, 2019</a>). The first data on this ‘adaptation marker’ became available in 2012 for the financial flows of 2010.

Hence, the amount of adaptation finance from public sources may be lower than reported.

They may aim to combat many risks, could adversely interact with other risks and actions, or may be nested within a suite of actions across many risks. Some actions may have negative consequences for climate resilient development. In this broader context, the effectiveness of adaptations for supporting climate resilient development is now better articulated (Box 17.1). Importantly, adaptations need to be designed to not only combat current and future climate risks but also ensure that they do not lock in undesirable pathways in the future as risks develop and change (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>very high confidence</span>) (Sections 17.2, 17.3.1, 17.5). Effective management of climate risks will therefore be dependent on satisfactorily managing current climate risks (Boxes 17.1, 17.2, 17.5), coupled with assessing prognoses for future climate risks, and developing responses in advance for reducing those risks to tolerable residual levels (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>very high confidence</span>) (Sections 1.4, 1.6, 16.6, 17.2, Box 16.1; e.g., water risks, <a class="section-link" data-title="Current Water-Related Adaptation Responses, Benefits, Co-benefits and Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.1">Section 4.7.1</a>). The dynamic nature of risk (Viner et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Simpson--2021">Simpson et al., 2021</a>; Sections 16.3, 16.6) also means that the contribution of current adaptations to ameliorating future risks needs to be regularly reviewed (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Monitoring, Evaluation &amp; Learning" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.5.2">Section 17.5.2</a>).

These can include data services, decision-support tools, processes for making decisions and methods for monitoring and evaluating progress and success. Data services enable the identification, location and timing of risks that could manifest with negative impacts, as well as potential opportunities. Often, these are termed ‘climate services’ and assist with mapping hazards and how they are changing. Decision-support tools range from qualitative approaches to determining overlap of areas of concern with those hazards in the future, to more quantitative and dynamic simulation approaches that enable dynamic stress-testing of adaptation options and strategies to determine if proposed plans for adapting to the future could be successful. An important consideration is whether options for risk management or capitalisation on opportunities will limit options and flexibility for responding to unforeseen events in the future. If these options have a negative effect on other areas of concern, then they could be identified in these planning scenarios as maladaptations, and therefore avoided.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 17.1_p2">A great challenge for decision makers is how to choose effective options when the future is uncertain. Uncertainty can arise not just in the statistical error of the magnitude of risk but also in the nature and consequence of risk from uncertainty about mechanisms that link areas of concern to hazards, uncertainty in the decision processes themselves and so on. Methods are available to help develop no-regret options, commonly referred to as decision-making under conditions of deep uncertainty’.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 17.1_p3">Decision-support frameworks are most successful when they are iterative, integrative and consultative. Rather than a single decision be made, and an action taken, there are processes for making the best decision possible, then monitoring progress towards delivering a successful outcome. Given a set of suitable indicators with regular monitoring, decisions can be revised, updated or changed as the future unfolds and foundations for the original decision tested. This is important because climate responses need to be initiated well in advance of them being needed due to the time required to implement suitable responses. These forward-looking approaches allow errors to occur and corrections made before problems arise. They also enable action to be taken without having to wait for the circumstances to arise, which if this were to occur could result in only limited reactions being available and the outcomes then dependent upon recovery from events rather than proactive planning and avoidance of events. Integrated approaches to risk management are available to help manage portfolios of interacting risks, including the potential for compounding and cascading risks when climate-related events arise.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 17.1_p4">Managing uncertainty with forward-looking processes needs to be more deliberative and oriented towards building trust in a collaborative process. Building relationships through informal, bottom-up processes enables this to occur. Top-down planning processes are important for ensuring that the management of risks and opportunities do not end up with maladaptations and that the approaches are equitable and proportional to that which is needed to manage the risks.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 17.2"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 17.2 | What financing options are available to support adaptation and climate resilience?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-27-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead_H2" lang="en-GB" id="FAQ 17.2_p1">What do we mean by ‘climate finance’?</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 17.2_p2">The UNFCCC has no formally agreed upon definition of climate finance.

As an example of incremental adaptation, a farmer may decide to use drought-tolerant crops to deal with increasing occurrences of heatwaves. With further warming and increases in heatwaves and drought, however, the impacts of climate change may necessitate the consideration of system-wide change, such as moving to an entirely new agricultural system in areas where the climate is no longer suitable for current practices, or switching to livestock rearing. Where on-site adaptation becomes infeasible and pull factors exist, the farming households may decide to seek employment in other sectors, which may also lead to migration for work. As another example, physical protection through sea walls to stop coastal flooding is a proven adaptation measure. With further projected flooding due to increasing sea level rise attributable to climate change transformational city planning, that would systemically change how flood water is managed throughout the whole city, potentially requiring deeper institutional, structural and financial support. Also, the deliberate relocation of settlements (managed retreat) is seeing attention in the face of increasingly severe coastal or riverine flooding in some regions.

What remains is called residual risks and needs to be retained by households, the private and public sectors. People living in conflict-affected areas benefit only marginally from adaptation investments by governments, private sector or other institutions. These people bear most of the changing climate risks themselves. Higher-income countries generally have invested heavily in structural adaptation to make sure people are not exposed to extreme events (e.g., dykes) and have developed a variety of private or public insurance systems to finance the risk of the most rare or extreme events. In other, middle- or lower-income countries, these very extreme events are less likely to be insured, and the impacts are borne by the most vulnerable people. Absent risk reduction or insurance, coping with residual risks generally means reducing consumption (e.g., food) or drawing down assets (selling machinery, houses, etc.), which all can bring along longer-term adverse developmental implications. Adaptation investments in low-income countries tend to focus more heavily on increasing capacity and reducing vulnerability; people remain exposed to the changing climate risks and bear the burden of reacting and responding.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 17.5"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 17.5 | How do we know whether adaptation is successful?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-31-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 17.5_p1">Adaptation aims to reduce exposure and vulnerability to climate change by responding to dynamic and multi-scalar combinations of climatic risks. What might be seen as successful at one scale or at one point in time might not be at another, particularly if climate risks continue to rise. Moreover, the benefits of adaptation interventions may not reach all intended beneficiaries or everyone affected by climate impact and risk, causing different people to have different views on how successful adaptation has been.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 17.5_p2">There is, therefore, no universal way to measure adaptation success, but there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span> that success is associated with a reduction of climate risks and vulnerabilities (for humans and ecosystems) and an equitable balancing of synergies and trade-offs across diverse objectives, perspectives, expectations and values.

Among the adaptation options assessed in this report (Figure FAQ17.5.1), physical infrastructure along coasts (e.g., sea walls) has the highest risk for maladaptation over time through negative side effects on ecosystem functioning and coastal livelihood opportunities. However, such adaptations may appear valuable in the short and even longer term for already densely populated urban coasts, demonstrating that an adaptation can be differently judged based on the context it is implemented in (Figure FAQ17.5.1). Many other adaptation options have a larger potential to contribute to successful adaptation (Figure FAQ17.5.1), such as nature restoration, providing social safety nets and changing diets/minimising food waste.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 17.5_p4">Assessments of adaptation need to be transparent about how they are measuring success. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) can be used to track progress and evaluate success and to identify if course corrections during adaptation implementation are needed to achieve the envisaged objectives. Given the diversity of adaptation actions and contexts, no one-size-fits-all approach to M&amp;E and no common reference metrics for adaptation exist. To date, assessments of progress of adaptation have often focused on processes and outputs (i.e., actions taken, such as adaptation plans adopted) that are easier to measure than the effects of these actions in terms of long-term reduction of risks and vulnerabilities. However, knowledge about the outcomes in terms of reducing climate risk, impact and vulnerability is critically required to know if adaptation has been successful.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 17.5_p5">Tracking progress, in particular outcomes and impacts of adaptation, involves a number of challenges. First, to determine progress over time, risk and vulnerability assessments need to be repeated at least once after starting an adaptation process. This is rarely done, as it demands resources that are usually not factored into the adaptation response. Second, attributing changes in climate risks and vulnerabilities to the adaptation response is often difficult due to other influencing factors, such as socioeconomic development over time. Expected causal relationships between responses and their outcomes should already be outlined during the adaptation planning phase, for example by mapping the way from activities to outcomes, and they should be monitored during implementation. Third, as adaptation can occur in multiple forms and target multiple temporal and spatial scales, the engagement of a diversity of stakeholders is vital to understanding how responses enable adaptation and adaptation success across vulnerable groups. Although stakeholder engagement can be time intensive and costly, in particular when reaching out to populations that are usually not part of policy and planning processes, it can support evaluating co-benefits and trade-offs of adaptation responses. Consideration and analysis of co-benefits and trade-offs along with a focus on short, medium and long time horizons of adaptation goals, which is usually possible through flexible and strong institutions, facilitate successful adaptation and reduce the likelihood of maladaptation.</p><div class="Figure"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-17" id="figure-17-faq-17-5-1" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_17_FAQ_17_5_1.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure FAQ17.5.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Contribution of adaptation options to potentially successful adaptation and to the risk of maladaptation. </span>Note: A similar figure is part of <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Success and Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.5.1">Section 17.5.1</a>.</p></div><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_continued-prev-page" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 17.5_p7">Box FAQ 17.5</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_References_head" lang="en-GB"><span>References</span> </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-8-siblings"><p class="References_References_body" id="references_p1" lang="en-GB">Abadie, L.M., I.
