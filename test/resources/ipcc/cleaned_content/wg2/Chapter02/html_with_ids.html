Where sufficient evidence exists, differences in biological responses across regions, taxonomic groups or types of ecosystems are presented, particularly when such differences provide meaningful insights into current or potential future autonomous or human-mediated adaptations. Human interventions that might build the resilience of ecosystems and minimise the negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are assessed. Such interventions include adaptation strategies and programmes to support biodiversity conservation and Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA). The assessments were done in the context of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and sustainable development goals (SDGs), whose contributions to climate resilient development (CRD) pathways are assessed.

The critique of ‘global’ studies by (<a class="reference-link" href="#Feeley--2017">Feeley et al., 2017</a>) argues that their naming is misleading, that most of them are far from global, and that a considerable geographic and taxonomic bias remains.

First, confidence rises when the time span of biological records is long, such that decadal trends in climate can be compared with decadal trends in biological response, and long-term trends can be statistically distinguished from natural variability. Second, confidence can be increased by examining a large geographic area, which tends to diminish the effects of local confounding factors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parmesan--2013">Parmesan et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Daskalova--2021">Daskalova et al., 2021</a>). Third, confidence is increased when there is experimental or empirical evidence of a mechanistic link between particular climate metrics and a biological response. Fourth, confidence is increased when particular fingerprints of climate change are documented that uniquely implicate climate change as the causal driver of the biological change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parmesan--2003">Parmesan and Yohe, 2003</a>). These conditions constitute multiple lines of evidence, which, when they converge, can provide <span class="condensed_italic" lang>very high confidence</span> that climate change is the causal driver of an observed change in a particular biological species or system (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parmesan--2013">Parmesan et al., 2013</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.1.3 _p3">Important factors that may confound or obscure effects of climate change are the presence of invasive species, changes in land use (LULCC) and, in freshwater systems, eutrophication (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019a">IPCC, 2019a</a>). The temporal and spatial scale of studies also affects estimates of impacts.

As numbers of studies increase and data is increasingly extracted from areas with high LULCC, attribution is more difficult as habitat loss and fragmentation are known major drivers of changes in terrestrial and freshwater species (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ramsar%20Convention%20on%20Wetlands--2018">Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPBES--2019">IPBES, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tickner--2020">Tickner et al., 2020</a>). Due to the overwhelming volume of literature, the assessments for chapter 2 concentrates on results from large continental or global-scale reviews and meta-analyses. Most of the assessment of studies conducted in individual countries can be found in Regional chapters, but this chapter does include studies across very large countries or political entities that occupy much of a continent (e.g., Canada, the USA, Australia or Europe), or studies that provide rare or uniquely-relevant information.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="2.4.2"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">2.4.2 Observed Responses to Climate Change by Species and Communities (Freshwater and Terrestrial)<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-8-siblings"><div class="h3-container" id="2.4.2.1"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">2.4.2.1 Observed Range Shifts Driven by Climate Change <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-7-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.4.2.1_p1">Poleward and upward range shifts were already attributable to climate warming with <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> in AR5.

If climate change continues to worsen, it is expected to cause many more species to become extinct unless we take actions to improve the resilience of natural areas, through protection, connection and restoration. We can also help individual species that we care most about by reducing the stress that they are under from human activities, and even helping them move to new places as their climate space shifts and they need to shift to keep up. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.1_p2">Climate change has already caused some species to become extinct and is expected to drive more species to extinction. Extinction of species has always occurred in the history of our planet, but human activities are accelerating this process, such that the estimated 10% of species that humans have driven to extinction in the past 10,000 years is roughly 1,000 times the natural background rate. Recent research predicts that climate change would add to that, with estimates that about one-third of all plant and animal species are at high risk of extinction by 2070 if climate change continues at its current rate. Species can adapt to some extent to these rapidly changing climate patterns. We are seeing changes in behaviour, dispersal to new areas as the climate becomes more suitable, and genetic evolution. However, these changes are small, and adaptations are limited. Species that cannot adapt beyond their basic climate tolerances (their ability to survive extremes of temperature or rainfall) or successfully reproduce in a different climate environment from that in which they have evolved, will simply disappear. In the Arctic, for example, the sea ice is melting and, unless there are deep cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, will probably disappear in summer within the century. This means that the animals that have evolved to live on sea ice—polar bears and some seals—will become extinct soon after the ice disappears.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.1_p3">Fortunately, there are some things we can do to help. We can take action to assist, protect and conserve natural ecosystems and prevent the loss of our planet’s endangered wildlife, such as:</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.1_p4"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>‘Assisting’ the migration of species. </span>This has many names, ‘assisted colonisation’, ‘assisted translocation’, ‘assisted migration’ and ‘assisted movement’. In effect, it is about helping endangered species to move to a new area with a good habitat for them to survive. ‘Passive’ assisted colonisation focusses on helping species move themselves, while the most ‘active’ form implies picking up individuals and transporting them to a new location. This is different from reintroductions that are already a normal part of conservation programs. Climate-driven translocations constitute moving plants or animals to an area where they have never lived historically, a new location that is now suitable for them due to climate change.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.1_p5">This active form of ‘assisted colonisation’ has been controversial, because exotic species can become invasive when they are moved between continents or oceans. For example, no one would advocate moving polar bears to Antarctica, as they would likely feast on native penguins, thus causing another conservation problem. However, moving species only a few hundred kilometers avoids most adverse outcomes, and this is often all that is needed to help a wild plant or animal cope with lower levels of climate change. In extreme cases, another type of assisted adaptation is to preserve species until we can stabilize then reverse climate change, and then reintroduce them to the wild. This might include moving them into zoos or into seed or frozen embryo banks.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.1_p6"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Extending protected zones and their connectivity. </span>The ability of species to move to new locations and track climate change are very limited, particularly when a habitat has been turned into a crop field or a city. To help species move between their natural habitats, we can increase the connectedness of protected areas, or simply create small patches or corridors of semi-wild nature within a largely agricultural or inhabited region that encourages wildlife to move through an area, and in which they are protected from hunting and poisons. These semi-wild protected areas can be very small, like the hedgerows between fields in England that provide both a habitat for many flowers, birds and insects and corridors to move between larger protected areas. Alternatively, it can just be an abandoned field that is now growing ‘weeds’ and with a ban on use of pesticides or herbicides, hunting or farming. For instance, in the USA, private landowners get a tax break by making their land a ‘wildlife conservation’ area by using no pesticide, not cutting weeds too often, putting up brush piles and bird boxes for nesting by mammals and birds, and providing a stable water source.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.1_p7">Assisting, protecting and conserving natural ecosystems would help enhance biodiversity overall as well as aiding already endangered species. Diverse plant and animal communities are more resilient to disturbances, including climate change. A healthy ecosystem also recovers more quickly from increases in extreme events, such as floods, droughts and heat waves, that are a part of human-driven climate change. Healthy ecosystems are critical to prevent species’ extinctions from climate change, but are also important for human health and well-being, providing clean, plentiful water, cleaning the air, providing recreation and holiday adventures, and making people feel happier, calmer and more content.</p><div class="Figure"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-7" id="figure-2-faq-2.1.1" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_2_FAQ_2.1.1.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure FAQ2.1.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Possible actions to assist, protect and conserve natural ecosystems and prevent the loss of our planet’s endangered wildlife in the face of continued climate change. </span> (Inspired by the Natural Alliance website© Chris Heward/GWCT).</p></div></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 2.2"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 2.2 | How does climate change increase the risk of diseases?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-28-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Climate change is contributing to the spread of diseases in both wildlife and humans.

Zoonoses comprise nearly two-thirds of known human infectious diseases and the majority of newly emerging ones. COVID-19 is the most recent zoonosis and has killed millions of people globally while devastating economies. The risk posed by Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) has increased because of: (1) the movement of wild animals and their parasites into new areas as a result of climate change, global trade and travel; (2) human intrusion in natural areas and the conversion of natural areas for agriculture, livestock, the extraction of industrial/raw materials and housing; (3) increased wildlife trade and consumption; (4) increased human mobility resulting from global trade, war/conflicts and migration, made faster and extending farther due to fossil fuel-powered travel; and (5) widespread antimicrobial use, which can promote antibiotic-resistant infections (Figure FAQ2.2.1).</p><div class="Figure"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-8" id="figure-2-faq-2.2.1" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_2_FAQ_2.2.1.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure FAQ2.2.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>How diseases move from the wild into human populations. </span>Climate change may increase diseases in nature, but whether or not this leads to an increase in the risk of disease in humans depends upon a range of societal, infrastructural and medical buffers that form a shield protecting humans.</p></div><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.2_p4">Climate change further increases risk by altering pathogen and host animal (1) geographic ranges and habitats; (2) survival, growth and development; (3) reproduction and replication; (4) transmission and exposure (5) behaviour; and (6) access to immunologically naïve animals and people who lack resistance to infection. This can lead to novel disease emergence in new places, more frequent and larger outbreaks, and longer or shifted seasons of transmission. Climate change is making it possible for many EIDs to colonise historically colder areas that are becoming warmer and wetter in temperate and polar regions and in the mountains. Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are diseases spread by vectors such as mosquitoes, sand flies, kissing bugs and ticks. For example, ticks that carry the virus that causes tick-borne encephalitis have moved into the northern subarctic regions of Asia and Europe. Viruses like dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal in hilly and mountainous areas. Novel outbreaks of <span class="condensed_italic" lang>Vibrio</span> bacteria seafood poisoning are being traced to the the Baltic States and Alaska where they were never documented before. Many scientific studies show that the transmission of infectious disease and the number of individuals infected depends on rainfall and temperature; climate change often makes these conditions more favourable for disease transmission.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.2_p5">Climate change can also have complicated, compounding and contradictory effects on pathogens and vectors. Increased rainfall creates more habitat for mosquitoes that transmit diseases like malaria, but too much rain washes away the habitat. Decreased rainfall also increases disease risk when people without reliable access to water use containers to store water where mosquitoes, such as the vectors of dengue fever <span class="condensed_italic" lang>Aedes aegypti</span> and <span class="condensed_italic" lang>A. albopictus</span>, lay their eggs. Hotter temperatures also increase mosquito-bite rate, parasite development and viral replication! Certain species of snails are intermediate hosts for many helminth parasites that make humans, livestock and wild animals sick. When it gets hot, the snails can produce 2–3 times as many infective larvae; however, if it becomes too hot, many pathogens and their vectors cannot survive or reproduce.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.2_p6">Humans also contract zoonoses directly through their skin, mucus membranes and lungs, when eating or butchering animals or when they come into contact with pathogens that are shed into the air or passed in urine and faeces and contaminate water, food, clothing and other surfaces. Any activity that increases contact with wildlife, especially in high-biodiversity regions like the Tropics and subtropics, increases disease risk. Climate change-related disease emergence events are often rare but may become more frequent. Fortunately, there are ways to reduce risks and protect our health, as described below.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.2_p7"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Habitat and biodiversity protection. </span>Human encroachment into natural areas, due to expansion of agriculture and livestock, timber harvests, extraction of resources and urban development, has increased human contact with wild animals and creates more opportunities for disease spill-over (transmission from an animal to a new species, including humans). By conserving, protecting and restoring wild habitats, we can build healthier ecosystems that provide other services, such as clean air, clean and abundant water, recreation, spiritual value and well-being, as well as reduced disease spill-over. If humans must go into wild areas or hunt, they should take appropriate precautions such as wearing protective clothing, using insect repellant, performing body checks for vectors like ticks and washing their hands and clothing well.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.2_p8"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Food resilience. </span>Investing in sustainable agro-ecological farming will alleviate the pressure to hunt wild animals and reduce the conversion of more land to agriculture/livestock use. Stopping illegal animal trading and poaching and decreasing reliance on wild meats and products made from animal parts will reduce direct contact with potentially infected animals. This has the added benefit of increasing food security and nutrition, improving soil, reducing erosion, preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.2_p9"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Disease prevention and response. </span>The level of protection against infection is linked directly to the level of development and wealth of a country. Improved education, high-quality medical and veterinary systems, high food security, proper sanitation of water and waste, high-quality housing, disease surveillance and alarm systems dramatically reduce disease risk and improve health. Utilising a One Biosecurity or One Health framework further improves resilience.

Multivariate statistical analyses aid attribution studies by allowing the assessment of relative weights among multiple factors, including variables related to climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gonzalez--2012">Gonzalez et al., 2012</a>). However, drivers often have strong, significant interactions with one another, complicating quantitative assessment of the strength of individual drivers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parmesan--2013">Parmesan et al., 2013</a>).

Disturbance variability is an inherent characteristic of grassland systems, and suitable ‘control’ conditions are seldom available in nature.

Agricultural companies, small-scale farmers and livestock herders in many tropical areas cut down forests and intentionally set fires to clear fields and pastures. Cities, towns and roads increase the number of fires that people ignite. Governments in many countries suppress fires, even natural ones, producing unnatural accumulations of fuel in the form of coarse woody debris and dense stands of small trees. The fuel accumulations cause particularly severe fires that burn upwards into tree crowns.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.3_p5">Evidence shows that human-caused climate change has driven increases in the area burned by wildfire in the forests of western North America.

Human-caused climate change drove a drought from 2000 to 2020 that has been the most severe since the 1500s, severely increasing the aridity of vegetation. In British Columbia, Canada, the higher maximum temperatures of human-caused climate change increased burned area in 2017 to its widest extent in the 1950–2017 record, seven to eleven times the area that would have burned without climate change. Moreover, in national parks and other protected areas of Canada and the USA, most of the area burned from 1984 to 2014 can be attributed to climate factors (temperature, rainfall and aridity) and these outweigh local human factors (population density, roads and urban area).</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.3_p6">In other regions, wildfires are also burning wider areas and occurring more often. This is consistent with climate change, but analyses have not yet shown if climate change is more important than other factors. In the Amazon, deforestation by companies, farmers and herders who cut down and intentionally burn rainforests to expand agricultural fields and pastures causes wildfires even in relatively moister years. Drought exacerbates these fires. In Australia, much of the southeastern part of the continent has experienced extreme wildfire years, but analyses suggest that El Niño, a heat phenomenon that cycles up and down periodically, is more important than long-term climate change. In Indonesia, intentional burning of rainforests for oil palm plantations and El Niño seem to be more important than long-term climate change. In Mediterranean Europe, fire suppression seems to have prevented any increasing trend in burned area but the suppression and abandonment of agricultural lands have allowed fuel to build up in some areas and contribute to major fires in years of extreme heat. In Canada and Siberia, wildfires are now burning more often in permafrost areas where fire was rare, but analyses are lacking regarding the relative influence of climate change. For the world as a whole, satellite data indicate that the vast amount of land converted from forest to farmland in the period 1998–2015 actually decreased the total burned area. Nevertheless, the evidence from the forests of western North America shows that human-caused climate change has, at least on one continent, clearly driven increases in wildfire.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="2.4.5"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">2.4.5 Conclusions on Observed Impacts <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-11-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.4.5_p1">The consistency of patterns of biological change with expectations from regional or global warming processes, coupled with an understanding of underlying processes and the coherence of these patterns at both regional and global scales, all form multiple lines of evidence (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parmesan--2013">Parmesan et al., 2013</a>) that it is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>very likely </span> that the observed range shifts and phenological changes in individual species can be attributed to regional and global climate changes (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>very high confidence</span>) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Observed Responses to Climate Change by Species and Communities (Freshwater and Terrestrial)" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.4.2">Section 2.4.2</a>, Table 2.2; Table 2.3; Table SM2.1) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parmesan--2013">Parmesan et al., 2013</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.4.5_p2">Global and regional meta-analyses of diverse systems, habitats and taxonomic groupings document that approximately half of all species with long-term records have shifted their ranges poleward and/or upward in elevation and ~2/3 have advanced their timing of spring events (phenology)<span class="condensed_italic" lang> (very high confidence) </span> (<a class="section-link" data-title="Observed Responses to Climate Change by Species and Communities (Freshwater and Terrestrial)" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.4.2">Section 2.4.2</a>, Table 2.2) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parmesan--2015">Parmesan and Hanley, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Parmesan--2019">Parmesan, 2019</a>).

It results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure and hazard and can be represented as the probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the impacts if these events or trends occur (see Chapter 1, this report). The framework defines vulnerability as a pre-existing condition, incorporating the extent to which species or ecosystems are susceptible to, or unable to cope with, the adverse effects of climate change.

Observations of desert-greening show good agreement with earlier projections. Patterns of desertification are also occurring, although the geographical match between projections and observations shows moderate agreement, likely due to the strong role of land use in this process.

In the worst-case scenario (10th percentile of the models), some of the taxa show &gt;50% of the species at a <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high</span> risk of extinction. These assessments are also weighted by role the species in the taxa play in performing ecosystem services (both to the ecosystems and to humans, e.g., pollinators, detritivores). There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> for the moderate risk threshold because it is based on observed trends attributed to climate change. There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span> for future projections since, for the purpose of developing this burning embers diagram, these risk thresholds are based on one large study (covering &gt;119,000 species) for which there were multiple warming scenarios considered, and primarily on the loss of suitable climate.

Many factors govern the carbon balance of ecosystems, so changes have not been attributed to climate change. Tropical forests and Arctic permafrost contain the highest ecosystem stocks of above- and below-ground carbon, respectively. Due to deforestation and forest degradation, primary tropical forests currently emit more carbon to the atmosphere than they remove. Wildfires in the Arctic are contributing to permafrost thaw and soil carbon release. An emissions scenario of 2°C increase could thaw ~15% of permafrost area and emit 20–100 GtC by 2100.

Biodiversity—the variety of genes, species, communities and ecosystems—provides services that are essential for human health and productive livelihoods, such as breathable air, drinkable water, productive oceans and fertile soils for growing food and fuels. Natural ecosystems also help store carbon and regulate climate, floods, disease, pollution and water quality. The loss of species, leading to reduced biodiversity, has direct and measurable negative effects on all of these essential services, and therefore on humankind. A recent demonstration of this is the decline of pollinator species, with potential negative effects on crop pollination, a fundamental ecosystem function crucial for agriculture. The loss of wild relatives of the domesticated varieties that humans rely on for agriculture reduces the genetic variability that may be needed to support the adaptation of crops to future environmental and social challenges.</p><div class="Figure"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-21" id="figure-2-faq-2.4.1" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_2_FAQ_2.4.1.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure FAQ2.4.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>The positive relationship between human health and well-being and nature conservation. </span>Nature provides essential services to humans including material and economic services (i.e., ecosystem services) as well as cultural, experiential and recreational services, which, in turn, enhance human psychological and physical health and well-being.

However, in general, more diverse systems are more resilient to disturbances and able to recover from extreme events more quickly. Biodiversity loss means there are fewer connections within an ecosystem. A simpler food web with fewer interactions means less redundancy in the system, reducing the stability and ability of plants and animal communities to recover from disturbances and extreme weather events such as floods and drought.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.4_p5">In addition to ‘material’ and economic services such as eco-tourism, nature also provides cultural services such as recreation, spirituality and well-being. Specifically, being in ‘direct contact with natural environments’ (vs. an urban environment) has a high positive impact on human well-being (e.g., mood, happiness), psychological and physical health (energy, vitality, heart rate, depression) and socio-cognitive abilities (attention, memory, hyperactivity, altruism, cooperation).

Individuals who are more connected to nature are not only happier and healthier but also tend to engage more in pro-nature behaviours, making the enhancement of human–nature connectedness worldwide a valuable win–win solution for humans and nature to face environmental challenges.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="2.6 "><h1 class="Headings_H1-numbered" lang="en-GB">2.6 Climate Change Adaptation for Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-7-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6 _p1">Adaptation to reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems and their services to climate change has been addressed in previous IPCC reports, with AR4 and AR5 recognising both autonomous adaptation and human-assisted adaptation to protect natural species and ecosystems. In AR5, Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA), adaptation for people, based on the better protection, restoration and management of the natural environment, was identified as an area of emerging opportunity, with a dedicated Cross-Chapter Box on the topic. In the SRCCL, conservation, EbA and related concepts were integrated throughout; SR1.5 also noted the role of EbA. Since the last assessment report, the scientific literature has expanded considerably, with growing interest in the concept of Nature-based Solutions (NbS). This section assesses this new literature and its implications for the implementation of climate change adaptation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6 _p2">Previous sections of this chapter have set out the vulnerability of natural and semi-natural ecosystems to climate change, and the risks this poses to both biodiversity and ecosystem services (also sometimes described as ‘Nature’s Contributions to People’). Natural systems respond to climatic and other environmental changes in a variety of ways. Individual organisms can respond through growth, movement and developmental processes. Species and populations genetically adapt to changing conditions and evolve over successive generations. Geomorphological features, such as the path of watercourses, can also change naturally in response to climate change. However, there is a limit to which these natural processes can maintain biodiversity and the benefits people derive from nature, partly due to intrinsic limits, but also because of the pressures that people exert on the natural environment.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6 _p3">Most of this section therefore focusses on human interventions to build the resilience of ecosystems, enable species to survive or to adjust management to climate change. Vulnerability is, in many cases, exacerbated by the degraded state of many ecosystems as a result of human exploitation and LUC, leading to the fragmentation of habitats, the loss of species and impaired ecosystem function. This interaction between climate change and environmental degradation means that protecting ecosystems in a natural or near-natural state will be an important pre-requisite for maintaining resilience and give many species the best chance of persisting in a changed climate (<a class="reference-link" href="#Belote--2017">Belote et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Arneth--2020">Arneth et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ferrier--2020">Ferrier et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fran%C3%A7a--2020">França et al., 2020</a>). Protection from degradation, deforestation and exploitation is also essential to maintain critical ecosystem services, including carbon storage and sequestration and water supply (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dinerstein--2020">Dinerstein et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#P%C3%B6rtner--2021">Pörtner et al., 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6 _p4">It is worth briefly considering some key concepts that are relevant to adaptation in ecosystems. Adaptation for biodiversity and ecosystems can encompass both managing change and building resilience. We use the definition of ‘resilience’ set out Chapter 1: ‘the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation’. This includes the concept of ‘resistance’, which is used in some ecological literature to distinguish systems which are resistant to change from those that recover quickly from change. We consider both interventions designed primarily to protect biodiversity and those intended to reduce the risks of climate change to people.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6 _p5">A variety of terms are used to describe using environmental management to reduce the impacts of climate change on people in ways that also benefit biodiversity in the scientific literature, particularly EbA and NbS (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Societal Responses to Climate Change Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-1#1.4">Section 1.4</a>). EbA is the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people to adapt to climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Secretariat%20of%20the%20Convention%20on%20Biological%20Diversity--2020">Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2020</a>). EbA aims to maintain and increase the resilience and reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems and people in the face of the adverse effects of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vignola--2009">Vignola et al., 2009</a>). NbS is a broader term which is not restricted to climate change, and is also often used to refer to climate change mitigation; it has been defined by the IUCN as ‘Actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cohen-Shacham--2016">Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016</a>). This widely accepted definition excludes actions which use the natural environment to solve human problems but do not provide benefits for biodiversity, and is closely linked to the concept of the Ecosystem Approach. NbS is not a universally accepted term, but it is being increasingly used in the scientific literature. It is a concept which recognises the importance of biodiversity in ecosystem service provision, and offers the opportunity to address climate change and loss of biodiversity together in an efficient integrated way (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chong--2014">Chong, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Seddon--2020a">Seddon et al., 2020a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ortiz--2021">Ortiz et al., 2021</a>). Given that the focus of this chapter is on adaptation, we primarily use the term EbA as it is more specific, but we do so understanding that it can be regarded as a subset of NbS. The wider concept of NbS for climate change adaptation and mitigation is covered in a cross-chapter box on the topic (see Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6 _p6">Whilst we distinguish between adaptation for biodiversity and EbA, it is important to recognise that the two are linked in that, if ecosystems themselves are not resilient to climate change, they will not be able to provide adaptation benefits for people. The case for resourcing biodiversity conservation and building the resilience of ecosystems is also strengthened when there are direct benefits for people in addition to the more general benefits of biodiversity.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6 _p7">Ecosystems are specifically included in the adaptation goals set out in the Paris Agreement and are addressed in most national adaptation plans (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seddon--2020b">Seddon et al., 2020b</a>). There are also now a large number of adaptation programmes and plans for local governments and governmental and non-governmental conservation organisations. Adaptation for and by ecosystems needs to be understood and developed in the wider contexts of conservation, climate resilient development and sustainable development. There are significant potential synergies but also conflicts between different objectives which require an integrated approach (covered further in 2.6.7).</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="2.6.1"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">2.6.1 Limits to Autonomous (Natural) Adaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-16-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.1_p1">Natural ecosystems often have a high degree of resilience and can, to some extent, adjust to change. Species can adjust through evolutionary adaptation, distribution change, behavioural change, developmental plasticity and ecophysiological adjustment. There are, however, limits to autonomous adaptation, because of intrinsic limitations, the rate at which the climate is changing and the degraded state of many ecosystems.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.1_p2">None of the evolutionary changes either documented or theorised would enable a species to survive and reproduce in climate spaces that it does not already inhabit. It is very improbable that evolutionary responses would be sufficient to prevent species extinctions in the case of that species losing its climate space entirely on a regional or global scale (section 2.4.2.8) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parmesan--2015">Parmesan and Hanley, 2015</a>). At the highest risk are the world’s most cold-adapted species (whose habitats are restricted to polar and high mountain-top areas). Examples include the polar bear (<a class="reference-link" href="#Regehr--2016">Regehr et al., 2016</a>), ‘sky-island’ plants in the Tropics (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kidane--2019">Kidane et al., 2019</a>), mountain-top amphibians in Spain (<a class="reference-link" href="#Enriquez-Urzelai--2019">Enriquez-Urzelai et al., 2019</a>), mountain-top lichens in the Appalachians (USA) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Allen--2016">Allen and Lendemer, 2016</a>) and silverswords in Hawaii (<a class="reference-link" href="#Krushelnycky--2013">Krushelnycky et al., 2013</a>). However, there is potential for using evolutionary changes to enhance the adaptive capacity of target species, as is being done on the Great Barrier Reef by translocating symbionts and corals that have survived recent intense heat-induced bleaching events into areas that have had large die-off (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rinkevich--2019">Rinkevich, 2019</a>). Multiple studies have assessed when and how evolution might be able to help wild species adapt to climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ratnam--2011">Ratnam et al., 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sgro--2011">Sgro et al., 2011</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify mb-0" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.1_p3">Some of the reasons cited in the literature as limits to autonomous adaptation are:</p><ol><li class="Body_Lists_List_numbered-first" lang="en-GB">Genetic changes in populations require many generations and, for many species, operate on longer timescales than those on which the climate is currently changing. In addition, experiments indicate there are strong constraints to ability to evolve beyond current climatic limits.</li><li class="Body_Lists_List_numbered-continued" lang="en-GB">Many species are moving to higher latitudes as the climate warms, but not all are keeping pace with changes in suitable climate space (<a class="reference-link" href="#Valladares--2014">Valladares et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mason--2015">Mason et al., 2015</a>). Such ‘climate debt’ (see sections 2.4.2.3.1, 2.4.2.8, 2.5.1.3.1) indicates an inability for non-genetic autonomous adaptation (e.g., evidence of limited ability for plastic responses, like those stemming from dispersal limitations, behavioural restrictions or physiological constraints).</li><li class="Body_Lists_List_numbered-last" lang="en-GB">Some species have a low capacity for dispersal, which, combined with increased fragmentation of habitats, creates barriers to range shifts to match climate warming. Studies have shown that changes in the distribution of species and composition of communities are limited by the presence of intensively managed agricultural land fragmenting natural habitats (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oliver--2017">Oliver et al., 2017</a>).</li></ol><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.1_p5">There are a variety of mechanisms which promote the resilience of ecosystems through persistence, recovery and reorganisation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Falk--2019">Falk et al., 2019</a>). Changes in the balance of different plant species within a community can maintain the persistence of the community itself, maintaining its value as a habitat for other species and providing ecosystem services. In some cases, there are negative feedback mechanisms between biological and physical processes; for example, in peatlands, lowered water tables resulting from drier conditions can lead to reduced permeability of peat, increasing rates of water loss (<a class="reference-link" href="#Page--2016">Page and Baird, 2016</a>). There are limits to this resilience and the concept of tipping points beyond which ecosystems change state, and returning to the original state has been subject of much recent research (<a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Nes--2016">van Nes et al., 2016</a>). There is clear evidence that the degradation of ecosystems has reduced their resilience and that restoration can help to reduce risks to biodiversity and ecosystem services, discussed below (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation for Biodiversity Conservation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.2">Section 2.6.2</a>, 2.6.3). However, as the rate of climate change increases, the limits of this approach will start to be reached, and losses (including some with potentially catastrophic consequences) cannot be prevented; this is discussed further in <a class="section-link" data-title="Limits to Adaptation Actions by People" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.6">Section 2.6.6</a>.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="2.6.2"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">2.6.2 Adaptation for Biodiversity Conservation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-17-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.2_p1">A variety of approaches have been identified as potential adaptation measures which people can take to reduce the risks of climate change to biodiversity. (<a class="reference-link" href="#Heller--2009">Heller and Zavaleta, 2009</a> ), quoted in AR5, identified 113 categories of recommendation for adaptation from a survey of 112 papers and reports. Since then, the literature has expanded with thousands of relevant publications. Whilst there is increasing interest in adaptation for biodiversity conservation and a wide range of plans and strategies, there is less evidence of these plans being implemented. Since AR5, a number of studies, predominantly from Europe and North America, have investigated the extent to which adaptation has been integrated into conservation planning and is being implemented on a local and regional scale (<a class="reference-link" href="#Macgregor--2014">Macgregor and van Dijk, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Delach--2019">Delach et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Prober--2019">Prober et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Clifford--2020">Clifford et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Barr--2021">Barr et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Duffield--2021">Duffield et al., 2021</a>).

A recent review (<a class="reference-link" href="#Prober--2019">Prober et al., 2019</a>) concluded that out of 473 papers on adaptation, only 16% presented new empirical evidence and very few assessed the effectiveness of actual adaptation actions. It is also the case that relatively little research is focused on local-scale management interventions rather than on larger-scale strategies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ledee--2021">Ledee et al., 2021</a>), although there are some exceptions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Duffield--2021">Duffield et al., 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.2_p3">Although direct assessments of the effectiveness of adaptation actions are rare, since AR5, there have been an increasing number of empirical analyses of how different land use and management can influence the vulnerability of species and habitats. As climate change often interacts with other factors including ecosystem degradation and fragmentation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oliver--2015a">Oliver et al., 2015a</a>), actions to address these other interacting factors is expected to build resilience to climate change. Table 2.6 summarises evidence that supports the main categories of proposed adaptation measures. We have taken an inclusive approach and included studies that address extreme weather events such as droughts, which may be exacerbated by climate change, as well as long-term changes in climate variables. We have not distinguished between studies in which climate change adaptation was an explicit focus and those in which lessons for adaptation can be learnt, that is, when studies were conducted for other reasons but inform the assessment of the impacts of actions identified as potential adaptation measures.</p><p class="Body_Tables_Table_title" lang="en-US" id="2.6.2_p4"><span class="table_number" lang>Table 2.6 | </span>Evidence to support proposed climate change adaptation measures for biodiversity. <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>The evidence highlights that adaptation for biodiversity conservation is a broad concept, encompassing a wide range of actions. It includes targeted interventions to change the microclimate for particular species (e.g., by creating shade) to changing national conservation objectives to take account of changing distributions of species and communities. It includes targeted actions addressing both climate change and the protection and restoration of ecosystems, with multiple additional benefits including reduced vulnerability to climate change. Most of the studies are not direct tests of the impacts of adaptation actions which, as noted above, is an important gap in the evidence.

The total area of habitat, how fragmented it is, the size of habitat patches and the connectivity between them are inter-linked properties on this scale. A growing number of studies have investigated how these properties affect species ability to persist <span class="condensed_italic" lang>in situ</span> and colonise new areas. Overall, larger areas of semi-natural habitat are associated with increased resilience to ongoing climate change and extreme events as well as the capacity to colonise new areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Haslem--2015">Haslem et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Oliver--2017">Oliver et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Papanikolaou--2017">Papanikolaou et al., 2017</a>). Larger habitat patches can support larger populations of a given species, which are more likely to maintain themselves and recover from periods of adverse conditions. Inhabiting a large patch size has been found to increase the resilience of some populations of species to extreme events such as droughts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oliver--2015b">Oliver et al., 2015b</a>). They are also more likely to provide a range of different resources and microclimate conditions, which may increase the chances of the persistence of species under climate change. A larger area of habitat may also enable greater connectivity between patches and increase the chances of species colonising new areas as they track climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oliver--2015b">Oliver et al., 2015b</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.2_p7">Protecting and restoring natural processes is a general principle for maintaining and building resilience to climate change for biodiversity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Timpane-Padgham--2017">Timpane-Padgham et al., 2017</a>). One element of this is ensuring naturally functioning hydrology for wetlands and river systems (Table 2.6), which is particularly important in a context of changing rainfall patterns and increased evapotranspiration. An important development in approaches to conservation over recent decades has been the concept of re-wilding (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schulte%20To%20B%C3%BChne--2021">Schulte To Bühne et al., 2021</a>); this encompasses a number of elements of restoring natural processes, including the reintroduction of top predators, larger conservation areas, and less prescriptive outcomes than many previous conservation measures. There are elements of re-wilding which may well contribute to building resilience to climate change, but it will be increasingly important to factor climate change adaptation into the planning of re-wilding schemes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Carroll--2021">Carroll and Noss, 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.2_p8">The most consistently cited climate change adaptation measure for species is increasing connectivity to facilitate the colonisation of new areas. This reflects the fact that many species’ habitats are highly fragmented in areas with more intensive land management, which prevents them naturally changing their range to track changing climatic conditions. Advances and innovations in modelling techniques can support decision-making about connectivity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Littlefield--2019">Littlefield et al., 2019</a>). There is evidence from empirical and modelling studies that species can disperse more effectively in better-connected areas in terrestrial habitats (<a class="reference-link" href="#Keeley--2018">Keeley et al., 2018</a>). The issues are different in more natural landscapes—species may still be threatened in intrinsically isolated habitats, such as mountain tops, but connectivity cannot be created here in the same way. Evidence suggests that increased connectivity will only benefit a subset of species, probably those which are intermediate-habitat specialists that are able to disperse (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pearce-Higgins--2014">Pearce-Higgins and Green, 2014</a>). Generalists do not require corridors or stepping stones, while many corridors or stepping stones will not be of sufficient quality to be used by most habitat specialists. There should also be a caveat to the general principle that increasing connectivity is a benefit for climate change adaptation. It can increase the spread of invasive, pest and disease-causing species into newly suitable regions. In some places, isolated refugia may better allow vulnerable species and biological communities to survive.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.2_p9">There are many different approaches to increasing connectivity, ranging from increasing the overall area of suitable habitat to ‘corridors’ and ‘stepping stones’, with different strategies likely to be more effective for different species and circumstances (<a class="reference-link" href="#Keeley--2018">Keeley et al., 2018</a>). Connectivity can also be important in increasing the resilience of populations to extreme climatic events (<a class="reference-link" href="#Newson--2014">Newson et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Oliver--2015b">Oliver et al., 2015b</a>). Within freshwater environments, the connectivity of watercourses is essential. Fluvial corridors are necessary to ensure the survival of migrating fish populations, even without climate change; with climate change, connectivity becomes crucial for relatively cold-adapted organisms to migrate upstream to colder areas. Connectivity is also important for the larvae of benthic invertebrates to be able to drift downstream and hence to disperse (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brooks--2018">Brooks et al., 2018</a>); for adult benthic invertebrates, riparian and terrestrial habitat features can potentially affect dispersal. Connectivity within river and wetland systems for some species can also mediated by more mobile animal species such as fish and birds (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mart%C3%ADn-V%C3%A9lez--2020">Martín-Vélez et al., 2020</a>).

This has opened up the potential to include refugia in conservation plans and strategies to facilitate the local survival of species (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2016">Jones et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Morelli--2016">Morelli et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Morelli--2020">Morelli et al., 2020</a>), for example, targeting management actions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sweet--2019">Sweet et al., 2019</a>) aimed at supporting populations of species. This is likely to become an important aspect of climate change adaptation for biodiversity conservation in future. It is also possible to manipulate microclimate, for example, by creating shelters for birds’ nests; see Case Study in 2.6.5.5 of African penguins; (<a class="reference-link" href="#Patino-Martinez--2012">Patino-Martinez et al., 2012</a>). One specific approach of this sort is the planting or retention of trees and wooded corridors to shade watercourses (<a class="reference-link" href="#Thomas--2016">Thomas et al., 2016</a>). Riparian shading can also possibly help to reduce phytoplankton and benthic diatom growth in smaller streams and rivers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Halliday--2016">Halliday et al., 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.2_p12">Refugia often refer to locally cool places in a landscape, such as shaded slopes or high elevations, but they can also include places where the supply of water may continue during dry periods (<a class="reference-link" href="#Morelli--2016">Morelli et al., 2016</a>). Monitoring can reveal which streams, wetlands, springs and other aquatic resources retain suitable discharges, water quality, wetland area and ecological integrity, especially during dry years (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cartwright--2020">Cartwright et al., 2020</a>). Measures to conserve drought refugia may include protecting springs and other groundwater-fed systems from groundwater extraction, contamination, salinisation, surface-water diversion, channelisation of streams, trampling by livestock, recreation activities and invasive species and the effects of disturbances in the surrounding landscape (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cartwright--2020">Cartwright et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Krawchuk--2020">Krawchuk et al., 2020</a>).

In ecosystems in which a natural fire regime has been suppressed, restoration practices such as prescribed fires, thinning trees and allowing some wildfire where it benefits the ecosystem can be introduced to reduce increasing risks from severe wildfires (<a class="reference-link" href="#Meigs--2020">Meigs et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.2_p14">Protected areas—areas of land set aside for species and habitat protection with legal protection from development or exploitation—have been a cornerstone of nature conservation for many years. Their effectiveness under a changing climate has been the subject of debate and investigation. There is now a large body of evidence demonstrating that colonisations by range-shifting species are more likely to occur at protected sites than at non-protected sites for a wide range of taxa (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Thomas--2012">Thomas et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gillingham--2015">Gillingham et al., 2015</a>) including across continents (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pav%C3%B3n-Jord%C3%A1n--2020">Pavón-Jordán et al., 2020</a>). This is probably because, by protecting large areas of natural and semi-natural habitats, they provide suitable places for colonising species (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hiley--2013">Hiley et al., 2013</a>) which may not be available in the surrounding landscape. Although the evidence for protected areas being associated with reduced extinctions is weaker, the finding by Gillingham et al. (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gillingham--2015">Gillingham et al., 2015</a>) that protected sites were associated with reduced extinction rates at low latitudes and elevations is strongly suggestive that they can help species’ persistence in the face of climate change.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.2_p15">It is intrinsically difficult to assess the effectiveness of climate change adaptation measures, the benefit of which will be realised in the years and decades ahead (<a class="reference-link" href="#Morecroft--2019">Morecroft et al., 2019</a>). Nevertheless, taking into account the wide range of evidence reported above, including the theory, modelling and observations of the impacts of climate change in contrasting circumstances, it is possible to make an overarching assessment that appropriate adaptation measures can reduce the vulnerability of many aspects of biodiversity to climate change (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>). It is also clear, however, that to be most effective and avoid unintended consequences, measures need to be carefully implemented by taking into account specific local circumstances <span class="condensed_italic" lang> (robust evidence, high agreement) </span> and include the management of inevitable changes (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence, high agreement </span>). It is also clear that while there are now many plans and strategies for adapting biodiversity conservation to climate change, many have yet to be implemented fully (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence, high agreement </span>).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="2.6.3"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">2.6.3 Ecosystem-Based Adaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-18-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.3_p1">A study published in 2020 found that, out of 162 intended nationally determined contributions (covering 189 countries) submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as commitments to action under the Paris Agreement, 109 indicated ‘ecosystem-orientated visions’ for adaptation, but only 23 used the term ‘ecosystem-based adaptation’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seddon--2020b">Seddon et al., 2020b</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.3_p2">EbA includes a range of different approaches. Examples include restoring coastal and river systems to reduce flood risk and improve water quality, and the creation of natural areas within urban areas to reduce temperatures through shading and evaporative cooling. EbA is closely linked with a variety of other concepts such as ecosystem services, natural capital and disaster risk reduction (DRR). EbA was becoming a well-recognised concept at the time of AR5 but implementation was still at an early stage in many cases. Since then, pilot studies have been assessed and EbA projects have been initiated around the world. The evidence base continues to grow (Table 2.7), and this has led to increasing confidence in approaches which have been shown to work leading to further expansion in some countries (Table 2.7). However, this is not uniform and there is relatively little synthesis across disciplines and regions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seddon--2020a">Seddon et al., 2020a</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Chausson--2020">Chausson et al. (2020)</a> used a systematic mapping methodology to characterise 386 published studies. They found that interventions in natural or semi-natural ecosystems ameliorated adverse climate change impacts in 66% of cases, with fewer trade-offs than for more artificial systems such as plantation forest. However, the evidence base has substantial gaps. Most of the evidence has been collected in the Global North, and there is a lack of robust, site-specific investigations into the effectiveness of interventions compared to alternatives and more holistic appraisals that account for broader social and ecological outcomes.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.3_p3">Restoring coasts, rivers and wetlands to reduce flood risk have probably seen the largest investment in EbA and it is becoming an increasingly accepted approach in some places (e.g., case studies in Sections 2.6.5.2, 2.6.5.7), although significant social, economic and technical barriers remain (<a class="reference-link" href="#Wells--2020">Wells et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bark--2021">Bark et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hagedoorn--2021">Hagedoorn et al., 2021</a>). Natural flood management (NFM) encompasses a wide range of techniques in river systems and at the coast and has been used in varied locations around the world. In tropical and subtropical areas, the restoration of mangroves to reduce the risk of coastal flooding is a widely advocated, evidence-based approach (e.g., (<a class="reference-link" href="#H%C3%B8ye--2013">Høye et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sierra-Correa--2015">Sierra-Correa and Kintz, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Powell--2019">Powell et al., 2019</a>)). In temperate regions, salt marsh is a similarly important habitat (<a class="reference-link" href="#Spalding--2014">Spalding et al., 2014</a>). Both provide buffering against SLR and storm surges. Managed realignment of the coast, by creating new habitats, can lead to a loss of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, but it can protect them and the services they provide by reducing the risks of catastrophic failure from hard-engineered sea defences.</p><p class="Body_Tables_Table_title" lang="en-US" id="2.6.3_p4"><span class="table_number" lang>Table 2.7 | </span>Examples of key EbA measures with assessments of confidence.

Disease emergence in new areas requires independent drivers to coincide (i.e., increasing climate suitability for pathogen or vector survival and competence/capacity, and introduction of the pathogen, that is often via the mobility of human populations). Furthermore, the extent to which changes in ecosystem-mediated diseases impact human health is highly dependent on local socioeconomic status, sanitation, medical systems and practices (<a class="section-link" data-title="Observed Complex Phenological and Range Shift Responses" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.4.2.5">Section 2.4.2.5</a>, Figure FAQ2.3.1) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gething--2010">Gething et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lindgren--2012">Lindgren et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mordecai--2013">Mordecai et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Liu-Helmersson--2014">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bhatt--2015">Bhatt et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Morin--2015">Morin et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ryan--2015">Ryan et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wesolowski--2015">Wesolowski et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Stanaway--2016">Stanaway et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yamana--2016">Yamana et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mordecai--2017">Mordecai et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tesla--2018">Tesla et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ryan--2019">Ryan et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shah--2019">Shah et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Iwamura--2020">Iwamura et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mordecai--2020">Mordecai et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Col%C3%B3n-Gonz%C3%A1lez--2021">Colón-González et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ryan--2021">Ryan et al., 2021</a>).Thus, risk reduction is more effective when links between climate change, ecosystem change, health and adaptation are considered concurrently (Sections 2.4, 3.5.3, 7.2, 7.3, 4.3.3, 6.2.2.3, Table SM2.1).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_Table_title" lang="en-US"><span class="table_number" lang>Table Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS.1 | </span>Observed climate change impacts on cholera, dengue and malaria incidence.

Impacts of climate change on diseases and their vectors are most evident at the margins of current distributions. However, it is difficult to implicate climate change in areas with extensive existing transmission and vector/pathogen abundance, and it is particularly difficult to distinguish from concurrent directional trends in disease control, changes in land use, water access, socioeconomic and public health conditions. As a result, while many studies indicate increasing climate suitability of some areas for cholera, and changes in disease incidence for dengue and malaria, the degree to which these changes can be attributed to climate change remains challenging. Uncertainty statements for malaria and dengue reflect the degree to which observed trends in disease incidence can be related to observed climate change in the given region. For cholera, confidence statements reflect the degree to which observed trends in disease or pathogen incidence and coastal area suitability for outbreaks can be linked to observed climate change drivers in the given region.

We have therefore reviewed a series of contrasting case studies to illustrate some of the key issues. There is a pressing need for more thorough monitoring and evaluation of adaptation to assess effectiveness. Climate change adaptation is conceptually difficult to measure, but it is possible to test which techniques work in reducing vulnerability and to monitor their deployment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Morecroft--2019">Morecroft et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.5_p2">Adaptation can take place on a range of scales, with specific projects nested within overarching national strategies. Small-scale projects can be adaptation-focused, but on the larger scale, adaptation is often integrated with wider objectives. Within an urban or peri-urban context, the benefits of natural and semi-natural areas for health and well-being help to justify support for EbA. Economic well-being is also an important factor in many cases whether, as in Durban, South Africa (<a class="section-link" data-title="Case Study: Ecosystem Based Adaptation in Durban, South Africa" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.5.7">Section 2.6.5.7</a>), it provides new job opportunities or, as in the Andes (<a class="section-link" data-title="Case Study: Effects of Climate Change on Tropical High Andean Social Ecological Systems" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.5.4">Section 2.6.5.4</a>), it supports long-established agricultural practices. Action on the ground often depends on factors on a range of scales, for example, a local plan, a national strategy and international funding. In Durban, partnerships between local communities, local authorities and the academic community were essential, together with an international context. Nevertheless, there are examples of communities using traditional or local knowledge (LK) to adapt to changing circumstances, with little or no external input, (<a class="section-link" data-title="Case Study: Effects of Climate Change on Tropical High Andean Social Ecological Systems" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.5.4">Section 2.6.5.4</a>); Their scope for adaptation is, however, often limited by factors beyond their direct control.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.5_p3">Specific interventions to protect species from climate change, such as the case of African penguins in South Africa (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation in Practice: Case Studies and Lessons Learned" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.5">Section 2.6.5.5</a>) and threatened plant species in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (<a class="section-link" data-title="Case Study: Protecting Gondwanan Refugia against Fire in Tasmania, Australia" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.5.8">Section 2.6.5.8</a>), are rare. However, in countries where nature reserves are actively managed or where ecosystem restoration projects are progressing, local practitioners may use their knowledge to adapt to weather conditions and their associated effects (e.g., fire and water shortages). This is good practice, but it may not be sufficient to address the likely future changes in climate (<a class="reference-link" href="#Duffield--2021">Duffield et al., 2021</a>). Training and resources to support conservation practitioners are becoming available. Examples include the Climate Change Adaptation Manual in England, UK (<a class="section-link" data-title="Case Study: Adaptation for Conservation and Natural Flood Management in England, UK" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.5.2">Section 2.6.5.2</a>), and The Alliance for Freshwater Life (<a href="https://allianceforfreshwaterlife.org"><span class="Hyperlink" lang>https://allianceforfreshwaterlife.org</span></a>) which provides expertise for the sustainable management of freshwater biodiversity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Darwall--2018">Darwall et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.5_p4">Adaptation is widely recognised as important for national conservation policies and is being considered in a variety of countries (<a class="section-link" data-title="Case Study: Adaptation for Conservation and Natural Flood Management in England, UK" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.5.2">Section 2.6.5.2</a>, 2.6.5.3). Adaptation in this strategic context includes decisions about the selection and objectives for protected areas, for example, identifying places which can act as refugia. It can also mean recognising where protected areas remain important but will support a changing range of species and ecosystems. This is important for directing resources effectively and ensuring that the management of the sites remains appropriate. There are, however, often major uncertainties, and the extent to which there will be a need for more radical measures will depend on the success of reducing GHG emissions globally. A global rise of 1.5°C–2°C would require relatively incremental adjustments to conservation management in many parts of the world, but a 3°C–4°C rise would require radical, transformational changes to preserve many species and maintain ecosystem services (<a class="reference-link" href="#Morecroft--2012">Morecroft et al., 2012</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.5_p5">Whilst adaptation strategies for conservation are relatively common, at least on an outline level, their implementation is slow in most places. This may partly reflect a lack of resources for conservation in many parts of the world; however, another barrier is that people often value protected sites in their present form.

A number of the case studies above, such as in Durban and at Bhojtal Lake, illustrate this (section 2.6.5). A key element of CRD is ensuring that actions taken to mitigate climate change do not compromise adaptation, biodiversity and human needs. This depends on choosing appropriate actions for different locations (Box 2.2, Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter). A particularly notable case of this is the creation of woodland described in Box 2.2: re-afforestation of previously forested areas can provide multiple benefits (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lee--2018">Lee et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lee--2020">Lee et al., 2020</a>) including those for climate change mitigation, adaptation and biodiversity. However, planting trees where they would not naturally grow can create multiple problems including the loss of native biodiversity and the disruption of hydrology (Box 2.2). It is also the case that protection of existing natural forest ecosystems is the highest priority for reducing GHG emissions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Moomaw--2019">Moomaw et al., 2019</a>) and restoration may not always be practical (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Case Study: Addressing the Vulnerability of Peat Swamp Forests in Southeast Asia" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.5.10">Section 2.6.5.10</a>).

Poorly conceived and poorly designed mitigation efforts have the potential for multiple negative impacts: (1) cascading negative effects on long-term mitigation by promoting short-term sequestration over existing long-term accumulated carbon stocks; (2) being detrimental for biodiversity, undermining conservation adaptation; and (3) eroding other ecosystem services important for human health and well-being (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Conversely, well-designed and implemented mitigation efforts have the potential to provide co-benefits in terms of climate change adaptation as well as providing multiple goods and services, including the conservation of biodiversity, clean and abundant water resources, flood mitigation, sustainable livelihoods, food and fibre security and human health and well-being (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). A key aspect of such ‘smart’ climate mitigation is the implementation of inclusive and adaptive management pathways (<a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling and Governing Adaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-1#1.4.2">Section 1.4.2</a>). These entail acceptance of the uncertainty inherent in projections of future climate change, especially at the regional or local level, and using decision-making processes that keep open as many options as possible for as long as possible, with periodic re-evaluation to aid in choosing pathways forward, even as systems are being impacted by ongoing climate change (Figure Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL.1; Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17; <a class="section-link" data-title="Enabling and Governing Adaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-1#1.4.2">Section 1.4.2</a>).</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1"><div class="Box_Header-continued" id="_idContainer070"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_continued-subhead" lang="en-GB">Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL</p></div></div><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_Table_title" lang="en-US"><span class="table_number" lang>Table Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL.1 | </span>Assessment of benefits and trade-offs between mitigation and strategies for both biodiversity and human adaptation to future climate change.

Climate change is bringing an increasing number of threats to people, including flooding, droughts, wildfire, heat waves and rising sea levels. These threats can, however, be reduced or aggravated, depending on how land, sea and freshwater are managed or protected. There is now clear evidence that ‘Nature-based Solutions’ (NbS) can reduce the risks that climate change presents to people. ‘Ecosystem-based Adaptation’ (EbA) is a part of NbS and includes:</p><ul><li class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_List_unnumbered-first" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Natural flood management: </span>As warm air holds more water and, in some places, because of changing seasonal rainfall patterns, we are seeing more heavy downpours in many parts of the world. This can create serious flooding problems, with loss of life, homes and livelihoods. The risk of flooding is higher where natural vegetation has been removed, wetlands drained or channels straightened. In these circumstances, water flows quicker and the risk of flood defences being breached is increased. Restoring the natural hydrology of upstream catchments by restoring vegetation, creating wetlands and re-naturalising watercourse channels and reinstating connections with the floodplain can reduce this risk. In a natural catchment with trees or other vegetation, water flows slowly overland and much of it soaks into the soil. When the water reaches a watercourse, it moves slowly down the channel, both because of the longer distance it travels when the channel bends and because vegetation and fallen trees slow the flow. Wetlands, ponds and lakes can also hold water back and slowly release it into river systems.</li><li class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_List_unnumbered" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Restoring natural coastal defences: </span>Rising sea levels as a result of climate change mean that coasts are eroding at a fast rate and storm surges are more likely to cause damaging coastal flooding. Natural coastal vegetation, such as saltmarshes and mangrove swamps can, in the right places, stabilise the shoreline and act as a buffer, absorbing the force of waves. On a natural coast, the shoreline will move inland and as the sea level rises, the coastal vegetation will gradually move inland with it. This contrasts with hard coastal defences such as sea walls and banks, which can be overwhelmed and fail. In many places, however, coastal habitats have been cleared and where there are hard sea defences behind the coastal zone, the vegetation disappears as the coast erodes rather than moving inland. This is often referred to as ‘coastal squeeze’ as the vegetation is squeezed between the sea and the sea wall. Restoring coastal habitats and removing hard sea defences, can help reduce the risks of catastrophic flooding.</li><li class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_List_unnumbered" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Providing local cooling: </span>Climate change is bringing higher temperatures globally, which can result in heat waves that affect people’s health, comfort and agriculture. In cities, this can be a particular problem for health as temperatures are typically higher than in the countryside. Trees give shade, which people, in both rural and urban areas, have long used to provide cool places for themselves, for growing crops such as coffee and for livestock. Planting trees in the right place can be a valuable, low-cost natural-based solution to reduce the effects of increasing heat, including reducing water temperatures in streams and rivers which can help to maintain fisheries. Trees and other vegetation also have a cooling effect as a result of water being lost from their leaves through evaporation and transpiration (i.e., the loss of water through pores in the leaves, known as stomata). Natural areas, parks, gardens in urban areas can help reduce air temperatures by up to a few degrees.</li><li class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_List_unnumbered-last" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Restoring natural fire regimes: </span> Some natural ecosystems are adapted to burning, such as savannas and some temperate and boreal forests. Where fire has been suppressed or non-native species of trees are planted in more open habitats, there is a risk that potential fuel accumulates, which can result in larger and hotter fires. Solutions can include restoring natural fire regimes and removing non-native species to decrease the vulnerability of people and ecosystems to the exacerbated fire risk that climate change is bringing due to higher temperatures and, in some places, changing rainfall patterns.</li></ul><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.5_p4">NbS, including protecting and restoring mangroves, forests and peatlands, also play an important part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. They can also help people in a wide range of other ways, including through providing food, materials and opportunities for recreation.

(2020)</a> developed this approach for adaptation, recognising six different dimensions of feasibility: economic, technological, institutional, socio-cultural, environmental/ecological and geophysical (Table 2.9). Feasibility is considered more fully in other chapters of this report, including Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18. Adaptation for biodiversity conservation and EbA encompasses a large range of approaches and techniques (Sections 2.6.2, 2.6.3) and will vary in different contexts globally, as illustrated by the range of case studies (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation in Practice: Case Studies and Lessons Learned" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.5">Section 2.6.5</a>). It is important to take into account specific regional and local circumstances as well as the type of adaptation action envisaged before making a feasibility assessment. It is also important to note that what is a feasible adaptation response at one point in time may change with the level of warming experienced—some techniques will be become less effective at higher levels of warming. With global temperature rises of &lt;2°C, in many cases, it will be realistic to build resilience and maintain species and ecosystems <span class="condensed_italic" lang>in situ</span>, but, at higher levels of warming, this will become increasingly difficult; managing inevitable change, including the consequences of loss and damage, will be important (<a class="reference-link" href="#Prober--2019">Prober et al., 2019</a>). Similarly, to be effective at higher levels of warming may require the adaptation of the EbA approaches themselves (<a class="reference-link" href="#Calliari--2019">Calliari et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mart%C3%ADn--2021">Martín et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ossola--2021">Ossola and Lin, 2021</a>).

There is also a challenge where there is high demand for land for other purposes, especially for agriculture and urban development.

Costs of adaptation vary greatly depending on the actions taken, the location, the methods used, the need for ongoing maintenance and whether land purchase is necessary. At its simplest, adaptation may be a matter of taking account of actual or potential climate change impacts in the course of conservation planning and have little or no additional cost. For example, if a species of conservation concern colonises or starts to use a new area as a result of climate change, like migrant waterfowl shifting the locations where they overwinter (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pav%C3%B3n-Jord%C3%A1n--2020">Pavón-Jordán et al., 2020</a>), protection or habitat management may be redirected there. At the other extreme, large-scale restoration can incur significant costs, for example, between 1993 and 2015, the EU-LIFE nature programme invested 167.6 million Euro in 80 projects, which aim to restore over 913 km <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span> of peatland habitats in Western European countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Andersen--2017">Andersen et al., 2017</a>). This is equivalent to &lt;2% of the remaining peatland area, much of which has been affected to at least some extent by human pressures, and restoring the total affected area will cost considerably more.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.8 _p6"><a class="reference-link" href="#De%20Groot--2013">De Groot et al. (2013)</a> analysed 94 restoration projects globally and found costs varied by several orders of magnitude, but in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems mostly in the range of USD 100–10,000 per hectare. They did, however, estimate that the majority of these projects provided net benefits and should be considered as high-yield investments. Some methods can be much cheaper than others, even in the same type of ecosystems in the same country; the estimated cost of restoring forest cover in Brazil varied between a mean of USD 49 using natural regeneration compared to a mean of USD 2041 per hectare using planting (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brancalion--2019">Brancalion et al., 2019</a>). When assessing costs, it is also important to take into account the benefits delivered by different options, both in economic terms and regarding other wider benefits.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.8 _p7">The ‘technological’ dimension of feasibility in the context of ecosystems can be regarded as the range of techniques available and the capacity to implement them. As described in Sections 2.6.2 and 2.6.3 above, a wide range of techniques have been developed and are starting to be implemented. There is good evidence to support adaptation for biodiversity and EbA in general terms and, in many cases, adaptation draws on techniques for habitat creation and restoration which have been developed to meet other objectives. However, feasibility needs to be assessed alongside the likely effectiveness: a feasible but ineffective scheme is of no value and the evaluation of success for specific interventions remains poorly developed (<a class="reference-link" href="#Morecroft--2019">Morecroft et al., 2019</a>). It is therefore often important to proceed with the use of pilot studies, good monitoring and the evaluation of outcomes to build confidence before greater deployment of approaches. A linked technical area is the availability of specialist skills and knowledge to implement adaptation; this can vary considerably according to the type of adaptation measure.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.8 _p8">Institutional dimensions are dealt with more fully in other chapters, but in the specific context of the natural environment it is notable that EbA is relevant to a wide range of organisations and policy objectives, in addition to environmental departments, NGOs and agencies which traditionally deliver conservation. Upscaling implementation is likely to be dependent on this wider range of interests. There can, however, be problems, in that appropriate geographies for decision-making about ecosystems (e.g., a catchment) may not directly map onto governance arrangements.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.8 _p9">Socio-cultural factors are important for adaptation of the natural environment.

In this respect, adaptation by and for ecosystems should perform well, and this may be a reason to prefer EbA to other approaches when there is an alternative. It should, however, be noted that sometimes apparently environmentally positive approaches such as forest creation can be done in ways which are damaging (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climate Resilient Development" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.7">Section 2.6.7</a> and Box 2.2) and the impacts need to be critically assessed for local circumstances.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.6.8 _p11">Geophysical dimensions are important for ecosystems as they have typically shaped which ecosystems can occur where, and feasibility will depend on implementing adaptation options in places where they are appropriate.

There are many opportunities for NbS, which can provide climate change mitigation and adaptation in ways that protect and restore biodiversity and provide a wide range of benefits to people (Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter). There are also new technologies and approaches to develop the bioeconomy in ways which will provide many benefits (Cross-Working Group Box BIOECONOMY in Chapter 5). Nevertheless, renewable energy is a large and essential element of climate change mitigation and there are adverse impacts on biodiversity associated with some types of renewable energy, including wind and solar technologies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rehbein--2020">Rehbein et al., 2020</a>). However, one of the most serious conflicts emerging is that between land-based approaches to mitigation and the protection of biodiversity, particularly as a result of afforestation strategies and potentially large areas devoted to bioenergy, including bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). It is important to recognise the impacts of climate change mitigation at the same time as assessing the direct impacts of climate change, and ensure that adaptation and mitigation are joined up.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-2.2_p2">BECCS is an integral part of all widely accepted pathways to keeping global temperature rise to 1.5°C (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018b">IPCC, 2018b</a>). This requires large areas of land, which can be in conflict with the need to produce food and protect biodiversity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smith--2018">Smith et al., 2018</a>). One study examined the combined impacts of climate change and LULCC for bioenergy, and found that severe impacts on species were likely if bioenergy was a major component of strategies for climate change mitigation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hof--2018">Hof et al., 2018</a>). A study on the potential impacts of bioenergy production and climate change on European birds found that one scenario for land conversion for bioenergy to meet a 2°C target would have less impact on species range loss than a global temperature increase of 4°C, but noted that if bioenergy were the only mitigation option it would 'very likely result in the negative effects of bioenergy outweighing the positive effects' (<a class="reference-link" href="#Meller--2015">Meller et al., 2015</a>). To avoid the worst impacts of BECCS, it will need to be carefully targeted according to context and local conditions, and other mitigation strategies prioritised so that its use can be minimised (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019a">IPCC, 2019a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ohashi--2019">Ohashi et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-2.2_p3">Reforestation of previously forested areas can bring multiple benefits, but planting trees in places where they do not naturally grow can have serious environmental impacts, including potentially exacerbating the effects of climate change. Savannas are amongst the ecosystems at risk from afforestation programmes. Savannas are grass-dominated, high-diversity ecosystems with endemic species adapted to high-light environments, herbivory and fire (<a class="reference-link" href="#Staver--2011">Staver et al., 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Murphy--2016">Murphy et al., 2016</a>).

Planting trees in historically unforested areas (grasslands, shrublands, savannas and some peatlands) can reduce biodiversity and increase the risks of damage from climate change. It is therefore essential to target tree planting to the appropriate locations and use appropriate species. Restoring and protecting forests reduces human vulnerability to climate change, reduces air pollution, stores carbon and builds the resilience of natural systems. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.6_p2">Like all living plants, trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. In trees, this carbon uptake is relatively long-term, since much of it is stored in the trees’ woody stems and roots. Therefore, tree planting can be a valuable contribution to reducing climate change. Besides capturing carbon, planting trees can reduce some negative impacts of climate change by providing shade and cooling. It can also help prevent erosion and reduce flood risk by slowing water flow and improving ground water storage. Restoring forest in degraded areas supports biodiversity and can provide benefits to people, ranging from timber to food and recreation.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.6_p3">There are some areas where replacing lost trees is useful. These include forest that has been recently cut down and where reforestation is usually practical. However, it is very important to correctly identify areas of forest that are degraded or have definitely been deforested. Reforesting places, especially where existing native forest patches occur, brings benefits both in sucking up carbon from the atmosphere and helping us to adapt to climate change. Plantations of a non-native species, although offering some economic benefits, do not usually provide the same range of positive impacts, generally have lower biodiversity, reduced carbon uptake and storage, and are less resilient to climate change.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.6_p4">Reforestation options include the natural regeneration of the forest, assisted restoration, enrichment planting, native-tree plantations, commercial plantations and directed tree planting in agro-forestry systems and urban areas. Reforestation with native species usually contributes to a wide range of sustainability goals, including biodiversity recovery, improved water filtration and groundwater recharge. It can reduce the risks of soil erosion and floods. In cities, planting trees can support climate change adaptation by reducing the heat of the area, and promote a wide range of social benefits such as providing shade and benefitting outdoor recreation. Urban trees can also lower energy costs by reducing the demand for conventional sources of cooling like air-conditioning, especially during peak-demand periods. It is therefore important to recognise that there are a wide range of different planting and forest management strategies. The choice will depend on the objectives and the location.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.6_p5"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Not everywhere</span> is suitable for tree planting. It is particularly problematic in native non-forested ecosystems. These natural ecosystems are not deforested and degraded but are instead naturally occurring non-forested ecosystems. These areas vary from open grasslands to densely wooded savannas and shrublands. Here, restoring the natural ecosystems instead of afforesting them will better contribute to increasing carbon storage and increasing the area’s resilience to climate change and other environmental changes. It is important to remember that, just because a tree can grow somewhere, it does not mean that it should. These systems are very important in their own right, storing carbon in soils, supporting rich biodiversity and providing people with important ecosystem services such as grasslands for animal grazing. Planting trees in these areas destroys the ecosystem and threatens the biodiversity which is adapted to these environments. They can also impact on ecosystem services such as forage for livestock, on which many people rely.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.6_p6">Many of these open areas also occur in low-rainfall areas. Planting trees there uses a lot of water and can cause reductions in stream flow and groundwater. Many of these locations also burn regularly, and planting trees threatens the establishing trees but can also increase the intensity of the fires from that of a grass-fuelled fire to that of a wood-fuelled fire. Swapping grassy ecosystems for forests may contribute to warming, as forests absorb more incoming radiation (warmth) than grasslands. Aside from the negative impacts to adaptation, it is also questionable just how much carbon can be sequestered in these landscapes as planting trees in grassy ecosystems can reduce carbon gains. Furthermore, a high below-ground carbon store prevents carbon loss to fire in these fire-prone environments.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.6_p7">Another example is peatlands. Peat stores an incredible amount of carbon; maintaining and restoring peatlands is therefore important to reduce atmospheric carbon. However, the restoration actions depend on what type of peatland it is and where it is located. Many temperate and boreal peatlands are naturally treeless. Here, planting trees is often only possible following drainage, but draining and planting (especially of non-native species) destroys native biodiversity and releases GHGs. Many peatlands, especially in the Tropics, are naturally forested, and restoring them requires re-wetting and restoring the natural tree cover (see Figure FAQ2.2.1) which will increase carbon storage.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 2.6_p8">There are actions we can perform instead of planting trees in non-forested ecosystems, and these include:</p><ul><li class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_List_unnumbered-first" lang="en-US">Address the causes of deforestation, forest degradation and widespread ecosystem loss</li><li class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_List_unnumbered" lang="en-US">Reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels</li><li class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_List_unnumbered-last" lang="en-US">Focus on ecosystem restoration over tree planting.

Modelling of risks at the species level requires comprehensive databases of the physiological, life-history, and reproduction of individual species, and modeling the impact of changes in species’ compositions requires a mechanistic understanding of functional traits relevant to ecosystem integrity, functioning and resilience to climate change.

In particular, while many adaptation measures have been proposed and implementation is starting, there are very few evaluations of success in the scientific literature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Morecroft--2019">Morecroft et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Prober--2019">Prober et al., 2019</a>). As detailed in <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation for Biodiversity Conservation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.6.2">Section 2.6.2</a>, there is a strong body of literature on conceptual approaches to climate change adaptation for biodiversity but very little empirical testing of which approaches actually work best. Going forward, it is important to put in place good monitoring and evaluation of adaptation strategies. For EbA, there are good examples of measuring changes in response to new adaptation measures, but these remain relatively rare globally.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="2.7.3 _p2">Human factors which promote or hinder adaptation are important as well as the technical issues.

There is a need for better assessment of global adaptation costs, funding and investment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Micale--2018">Micale et al., 2018</a>). Potential synergies between international finance for disaster risk management (DRM) and adaptation have not yet been fully realised. Research has almost exclusively focused on normalising losses for changes in exposure, but not for vulnerability, which is a major gap, given the dynamic nature of vulnerability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mechler--2015">Mechler and Bouwer, 2015</a>).</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_References_head" lang="en-GB"><span>References</span> </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-9-siblings"><p class="References_References_body" id="references_p1" lang="en-GB">Abatzoglou, J.
