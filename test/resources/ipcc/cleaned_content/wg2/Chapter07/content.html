Four Sami reindeer herding cooperatives participated in the pilot study. They all agreed that climate change means that grazing patterns need to change. Traditionally, mountain reindeer graze in the Scandinavian mountains close to Norway in summer and in the coastal areas close to the Gulf of Bothnia in winter, representing a total migration route of up to 400 kilometres one-way. Rising temperatures are causing spring to occur earlier in the coastal winter grazing land before the calving areas in the summer land are suitable for grazing and free from snow. When the snow cover disappears, the herds are dispersed, so it is important to migrate while snow is still present (<a class="reference-link" href="#Walkep%C3%A4%C3%A4--2019">Walkepää, 2019</a>). Migration routes are being destabilised by weaker ice cover on water and by hazardous weather events. Competing land use due to infrastructure, extractive industries, tourism, and energy production makes it difficult to find alternative grazing land. Supplementary feeding and increased use of trucks to transport reindeer is one result. Herds that are dispersed due to bad snow conditions have an increased exposure to predators (<a class="reference-link" href="#Walkep%C3%A4%C3%A4--2019">Walkepää, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Uboni--2020">Uboni et al., 2020</a>).

A key challenge in quantifying the specific relationship between climate and health outcomes is distinguishing the extent to which observed changes in prevalence of a climate-sensitive disease or condition are attributable directly or indirectly to climatic factors as opposed to other non-climatic causal factors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ebi--2020">Ebi et al., 2020</a>). A subsequent challenge is then determining the extent to which those observed changes in health outcomes associated with climate are attributable to events or conditions associated with natural climate variability compared to persistent human induced shifts in the mean and/or the variability characteristics of climate (i.e., anthropogenic climate change). The context within which the impacts of climate change affect health outcomes and health systems is described in this chapter as being a function of risk, which is in turn a product of interactions between hazard, exposure and vulnerability (Chapter 1), with the impacts in turn having the potential to reinforce vulnerability and/or exposure to risk (Figure 7.4).</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer015"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" id="figure-7-004" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_7_004.png"></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title ParaOverride-6" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 7.4 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Interactions between hazard, exposure and vulnerability that generate impacts on health systems and outcomes, with selected examples. </span>WBD: waterborne disease, VBD: Vector-borne disease, and FBD: Food-borne disease.</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-7.2"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 7.2 | The Global Burden of Climate-Sensitive Health Outcomes Assessed in this Chapter</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-26-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Global statistics for death and loss of health are increasingly described in terms of <span class="condensed_italic" lang>burden</span>, which describes gaps between a population’s actual health status and what its status would be if its members lived free of disease and disability to their collective life expectancy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Shaffer--2019">Shaffer et al., 2019</a>). Burden for each disease/health outcome is estimated by adding together the number of years of life lost (YLL) by a person because of early death and the number of years of life lived with disability (YLD) from the considered outcome. The resulting statistic, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) represents the loss of one year of life lived in full health. The total global burden of disease (Vos et al., 2020), expressed in DALYs, is what the world’s health systems must manage and is reported annually in Global Burden of Disease Study (Vos et al., 2020).

Of these, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) comprised the largest proportion of climate-sensitive diseases (32.8% of deaths and 15.5% DALYs). The next largest category consists of respiratory diseases – with chronic respiratory disease contributing to 7% of deaths and 4.1% of DALYs and respiratory infection and tuberculosis contributing to 6.5% of deaths and 6% of DALYs.

Many infectious agents, vectors, non-human reservoir hosts, and pathogen replication rates can be sensitive to ambient climatic conditions. Elevated proliferation and reproduction rates at higher temperatures, longer transmission season, changes in ecology and climate-related migration of vectors, reservoir hosts or human populations contribute to this climate sensitivity (Rocklöv &amp; Dubrow, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Semenza--2021">Semenza and Paz, 2021</a>). Age-standardised DALY rates for many VBDs have decreased over the last decade due to factors unrelated to climate. Vulnerability to VBD is strongly determined by sociodemographic factors (e.g., children, the elderly and pregnant women are at greater risk) with exposure to vectors being strongly influenced by various factors including socioeconomic status, housing quality, healthcare access, susceptibility, occupational setting, recreational activity, conflicts and displacement ( Rocklöv &amp; Dubrow, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Semenza--2021">Semenza and Paz, 2021</a>).

Although no association between anomalous climate conditions and influenza have been reported in some locations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lam--2020">Lam et al., 2020</a>), generally, low winter temperatures and humidity in temperate regions and periods of high humidity and precipitation in the tropical and subtropical regions have been linked to outbreaks of influenza (<a class="reference-link" href="#Deyle--2016">Deyle et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Soebiyanto--2015">Soebiyanto et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tamerius--2013">Tamerius et al., 2013</a>).

It emphasises the importance of effective communication of scientific knowledge (<a class="reference-link" href="#Semenza--2021">Semenza et al., 2021</a>), decision-making under uncertainty and decision frameworks that navigate different values and priorities. Successful policy responses were based on the emerging data, medical advice and collaboration with a wider set of societal stakeholders beyond public health experts. For instance, experience in Aotearoa, New Zealand, highlights the importance of pandemic responses attuned to the needs of different sociocultural groups and Indigenous Peoples in particular. Their strengths-based COVID-19 response goes beyond identifying vulnerabilities to unlocking the resources, capabilities and potential that might otherwise be latent in communities (<a class="reference-link" href="#McMeeking--2020">McMeeking and Savage, 2020</a>).

With adequate policy support, migration in the context of climate change can result in synergies for both adaptation and development (Sections 5.12.2, 7.4.4, 8.2.1.3). Migration governance at local, national and international levels will influence the outcomes of climate-related migration for the migrants themselves as well as for receiving and origin communities (Sections 5.13.4, 7.4.4, 8.2.1.3). At the international level, a number of relevant policy initiatives and agreements, including Global Compacts for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and for the protection of Refugees; the Warsaw International Mechanism of the UNFCCC; the Sustainable Development Goals; the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction; and the Platform on Disaster Displacement, have already been established, merit continued pursuit and provide potential migration governance pathways (<a class="section-link" data-title="Migration and Adaptation in the Context of Climate Change" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-7#7.4.4">Section 7.4.4</a>). Policy and planning decisions at regional, national and local scales that relate to housing, infrastructure, water provisioning, schools and healthcare are relevant for successful integration of migrants into receiving communities (Sections 5.5.4, 5.10.1.1, 5.12.2, 9.8.3). Policies and practices on movements of people across international borders are also relevant to climate-related migration, with restrictions on movement having implications for the adaptive capacity of communities exposed to climate hazards (<a class="section-link" data-title="Climate, Migration and Linkages to Labour Markets and Social Networks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-7#7.4.4.2">Section 7.4.4.2</a>; Box 8.1).

At high levels of warming, tipping points may exist, particularly related to sea level rise, that, if crossed, would further increase the global population potentially at risk of displacement (Ranasinghe et al. 2021). Populations in low-income countries and small-island states that have historically had low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are at particular risk of involuntary migration and displacement due to climate change, reinforcing the urgency for industrialised countries to continue lowering GHG emissions, to support adaptive capacity-building initiatives under the UNFCCC and to meet objectives expressed in the Global Compacts regarding safe, orderly and regular migration and the support and accommodation of displaced people (Sections 4.3.7, 4.5.7, 5.12.2, 7.4.5.5, 8.4.2; Box 8.1; Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-7.4"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 7.4 | Gender Dimensions of Climate-Related Migration</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-30-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Migration decision-making and outcomes—in both general terms and in response to climatic risks—are strongly mediated by gender, social context, power dynamics and human capital (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bhagat--2017">Bhagat, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Singh--2020">Singh and Basu, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rao--2019a">Rao et al., 2019a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ravera--2016">Ravera et al., 2016</a>).

In urban settings in Kenya, Koren et al.

Analysing the global food riots in 2007/2008 and 2011, <a class="reference-link" href="#Heslin--2021">Heslin (2021)</a> stresses the role of local politics and pre-existing grievances in determining whether people mobilise around food insecurity (Chapter 5).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Climate-related internal migration has been associated with the experience of violence by migrants, the prolongation of conflicts in migrant receiving areas and civil unrest in urban areas</span> (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium agreement, low evidence</span>). Research points to the potential for conflict to serve as an intervening factor between climate and migration. However, the nature of the relationship is diverse and context specific. For example, displaced people and migrants may be associated with heightened social tensions in receiving areas through mechanisms such as ecological degradation, reduced access to services and a disturbed demographic balance in the host area (<a class="reference-link" href="#R%C3%BCegger--2020">Rüegger and Bohnet, 2020</a>).

Overall, more than half of this excess mortality is projected for Africa. Near-term projections (for 2030) are predominantly for childhood undernutrition (95,200 out of 241,000 total excess deaths) (Figure 7.8). The second study (Carleton et al. 2020) focused on all-cause mortality associated with warming under both a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) and a middle emissions scenario (RCP4.5). The analyses created a metric of death equivalents that accounted for hot and cold temperature-related mortality and the costs of individual level adaptation; no acclimatization or community-level adaptation, such as early warning systems, were incorporated. Average annual temperature-mortality-income per capita relationships estimated from pooled data from 40 predominantly middle- and high-income countries (38% of the world population) were applied worldwide. Under the high emissions scenario, climate change was projected to result in approximately 85 deaths equivalents per 100,000 population.</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer039"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-11" id="figure-7-008" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_7_008.png"></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 7.8 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Projected additional annual deaths attributable to climate change in 2030 and 2050 compared to 1961–1990 (<a class="reference-link" href="#WHO--2014">WHO, 2014</a>). </span></p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Temperature increases are projected to exceed critical risk thresholds for six key climate-sensitive health outcomes, highlighting the criticality of building adaptive capacity in health systems and in other sectors that influence health and well-being</span> (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>)<span class="condensed_italic" lang>. </span>Recently reported research illustrates the temperature thresholds under three adaptation scenarios describing the effectiveness of health systems to manage additional risks from climate change for heat-related morbidity and mortality; ozone-related mortality; malaria incidence rates; incidence rates of Dengue and other diseases spread by Aedes sp. mosquitos; Lyme disease; and West Nile fever (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ebi--2021a">Ebi et al., 2021a</a>).

For example, Table 7.1 shows projections of population exposure to heatwaves, as expressed by the number of person-days, for the 2061–2080 period aggregated by geographical region and SSP/RCP. At the global level, projected future exposure increases from approximately 15 million person-days for the current period to 535 billion person-days for high population growth under the high GHG emission SSP3-RCP8.5 scenario, while for the low population growth/high urbanisation and business as usual SSP5-RCP4.5 scenario, the exposure is substantially lower at 170 billion person-days. Spatial variations in future heatwave frequency and population growth play out in the form of significant geographical contrasts in exposure, with the largest increases projected for low latitude regions such as India and significant portions of sub-Saharan Africa, where increases in heatwave frequency and population are expected. Over East Asia and especially eastern China, exposures are projected to rise, with the effect of increases in heatwave frequency exceeding the countering effect of projected reductions in population, especially in non-urban areas. Further, for North America and Europe, where rural depopulation is projected, the predominant driver of increases in exposure is urban growth (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2018">Jones et

Even under best-case sustainable development scenarios, rising sea levels and associated hazards create risks of involuntary displacement in low-lying coastal areas and should be expected to generate a need for organised relocation of populations where protective infrastructure cannot be constructed (Horton and de Sherbinin, 2021; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hamilton--2016">Hamilton et al., 2016</a>).

This effect would be amplified in urban settings where heat-island effects occur and create a heightened need for air conditioning and other adaptation measures. In addition to risks associated with average temperature changes, <a class="reference-link" href="#Dosio--2018">Dosio et al.

How these changes in exposure to high temperatures will affect future migration patterns, particularly among vulnerable groups, will depend heavily on future adaptation responses (Horton and de Sherbinin, 2021). Multiple country-level studies assessed in Section 7.2 observe existing associations between extreme heat, its impacts on agricultural livelihoods and changes in rural-to-urban migration flows in parts of south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

The most reliable example of such studies to date is a World Bank report by <a class="reference-link" href="#Rigaud--2018">Rigaud et al.

Although country-specific scenarios for socioeconomic development and population are embedded in SSPs, research into future migration flows under climate change has not made great use of these. One of the few studies to do so found that safe and orderly international migration tends to increase wealth at regional and global scales in all SSP narratives, which in turn reduces income inequality between countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Benveniste--2021">Benveniste et al., 2021</a>).

One challenge concerns global and regional variability of baseline data for current populations, which is typically aggregated from national censuses that vary considerably in terms of frequency, timing and reliability, especially in low-income countries. A number of gridded mapping dataset initiatives emerged in recent years to support population–environment modelling research at global and regional levels, common ones being the Gridded Population of the World, the Global Rural Urban Mapping Project, and LandScan Global Population dataset (<a class="reference-link" href="#McMichael--2020">McMichael et al., 2020</a>). For future population projections at national levels, researchers commonly draw upon data generated by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, which publishes periodic projections for future fertility, mortality, and international migration rates for over 200 countries, the most recent projections being for the 2020 to 2100 period (UN DESA Population Division, 2019).

Consequently, there are dependencies that lie outside the jurisdiction of the health sector. All the health risks of a changing climate currently cause adverse outcomes, with policies and programmes implemented in at least some health programmes in some places. Policies and programmes are continuously modified to increase effectiveness; this will need to accelerate in a changing climate. Improvements are needed as more is understood about disease aetiology, changing socioeconomic and environmental conditions, obstacles to uptake and other factors.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Policies and programmes for climate-sensitive health outcomes are only beginning to incorporate the challenges and opportunities of climate change, although this is critical for increasing resilience. The fundamentals of many policies and programmes in a changing climate will remain the same: implementing infectious disease control programmes, preventing heat-related mortality and morbidity and reducing the burden of other climate-related health endpoints, but activities will need to explicitly account for climate change to continue to protect health. Even with such attention to climate change, there are limits to the feasibility and effectiveness of health adaptation options for extreme heat, controlling emerging infectious diseases and controlling cascading risk pathways.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">As discussed in Sections 1.4.2 and 1.5, an adaptation option is feasible when it is capable of being implemented by one or more relevant actors. In the health sector, WHO, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and other organisations provide technical expertise to ministries of health, who then provide national to local healthcare and public health services. Generally, the question is less of overall feasibility, given the range of potential adaptation options that have yet to be fully explored and implemented, but more of readiness to buy into the adaptation efforts required from health and other sectors. In specific contexts, feasibility also depends on governance capacity, financial capacity, public opinion and the distribution of political and economic power (Chapter 17). In other words, adaptation to climate change is broadly feasible with adequate investment and engagement, although this has yet to materialise, and in specific contexts feasibility is contingent and time-varying, and needs to be assessed at national to sub-national scales. For example, a scoping review in the Pacific region noted the following areas where further and significant investment and support are needed to increase feasibility of climate and health action: (a) health workforce capacity development, (b) enhanced surveillance and monitoring systems and (c) research to address priorities and their subsequent translation into practice and policy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bowen--2021">Bowen et al., 2021</a>). Vulnerability, adaptation and capacity assessments include consideration of the feasibility and effectiveness of priority health adaptation options and can help decision makers identify strategies for enhancing adaptation feasibility in specific contexts.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="7.4.2.3"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">7.4.2.3 Adaptation Options for Vector-borne, Water-borne and Food-Borne Diseases <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-45-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Integrated vector control approaches are crucial to effectively manage the geographic spread, distribution and transmission of VBDs associated with climate change</span> (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>)<span class="condensed_italic" lang>. </span> Some of the projected risks of climate change on VBDs can be offset through enhanced commitment to existing approaches to integrated case management and integrated vector control management (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ciss%C3%A9--2018">Cissé et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Confalonieri--2017">Confalonieri et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Semenza--2021">Semenza and Paz, 2021</a>).

Cities can integrate regional climate projections into their engineering models to produce lower-risk source waters and increase the resilience of water and sanitation technologies and management systems under a range of climate scenarios. Technologies can help abstract source waters from depth, introduce or increase secondary booster disinfection, design or modify systems to reduce residence times within pipes and/or coat exposed pipes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Levy--2018">Levy et al., 2018</a>).

(2018) and Singh et al. (2020)). Nineteen indicators of six dimensions of feasibility (economic, technical, social, institutional, environmental and geophysical) were considered. The lead time to initiate and the expected longevity of each option were examined. Feasibility was defined as how significant the reported barriers were to implement a particular adaptation option. Highly feasible options were those where no or very few barriers were reported. Moderately feasible were those where barriers existed but did not have a strong negative effect on the adaptation option (or evidence was mixed). Low feasibility options had multiple barriers reported that could block implementation. Effectiveness ratings were based on expert consultation and reflected the potential of the adaptation option to reduce risk.

The Compact’s objectives include reducing barriers to legal and safe migration, and facilitating the freer flow of remittances between sending and receiving communities. By doing so the Compact aims to increase the potential for migration to make positive contributions to sustainable development and to adaptive capacity-building. It also contains specific provisions pertaining to climate- and disaster-related migration and displacement. Objective 2 of the Compact aims at reducing drivers of involuntary or low-agency migration and recommends that states establish systems for sharing information on environmental migration, develop climate adaptation and resilience strategies harmonised at sub-regional and regional levels, and cooperate on disaster risk prevention and response. Other objectives in the Compact relevant to climate-related migration include Objective 5 (increasing pathways for regular migration) and Objective 19 (facilitating migrants’ ability to contribute to sustainable development). Objective 18, which links migration with skills development, is consistent with the ‘migration with dignity’ approach to displacement risks (<a class="reference-link" href="#McNamara--2015">McNamara, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kupferberg--2021">Kupferberg, 2021</a>). The 2018 Global Compact on Refugees observes that climate hazards increasingly interact with the drivers of refugee movements. The guidelines this Compact provides to governments regarding actions for addressing the causes of refugee movements and considerations for assisting and supporting refugees are useful for governments seeking guidance for all forms of displacement more generally, including displacement linked to climate change.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Pursuant to the Paris Agreement, a task force was struck by the Warsaw International Mechanism to make recommendations to the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC on how to reduce the risks of climate-related displacement. Its 2018 report recommended that parties work towards development of national legislation, cooperate on research, strengthen preparedness, integrate mobility into wider adaptation plans, work towards safe and orderly migration, and provide assistance to people internally displaced for climate-related reasons. Such recommendations dovetail strongly with the objectives of the Compacts on Migration and Refugees as well as the Sendai Framework for DRR and the 2030 SDGs. The SDGs, which include multiple goals and targets in which migration plays an explicit role in fostering development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nurse--2019">Nurse, 2019</a>), may be seen as completing the international policy arrangements necessary for addressing future climate-related migration and displacement.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="7.4.6.7"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">7.4.6.7 Inclusive and Integrative Approaches to Climate-Resilient Peace <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-70-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">CRDPs to reduce conflict risk rely on a shift in perspective from framings around resource scarcity and security to sustainable natural resource governance and peace (Brauch et al., 2016; Barnett, 2018; Dresse et al., 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Day--2020">Day and Caus, 2020</a>).

The Security Council Resolution 1325 Women and peace and security (S/RES/1325 (2000)) and the Sustaining Peace Agenda (A/RES/70/262 (2016)) are notable examples of this. The 2020 UNEP report on gender and security recommends integrated policy frameworks, better financing to strengthen women’s roles in peacebuilding, integrated programme design, and further research on gender, climate and security linkages. Inclusive approaches recognise that much of the vulnerability that drives conflict risk is generated by existing inequality and marginalisation of large proportions of the population—for example women and youth—and that peace cannot be achieved without their needs being taken into account and without their participation in peace processes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mosello--2021">Mosello et al., 2021</a>). Diverse and inclusive partnerships also require ways to better engage local-level participation, and improve understanding of how to build consensus through human rights-based approaches that recognize non-violent conflict and protest to be potentially positive and constructive elements of transformational approaches to building resilience (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nursey-Bray--2017">Nursey-Bray, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ensor--2018">Ensor et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schipper--2021">Schipper et al., 2021</a>).

Changes in the magnitude, frequency and intensity of extreme climate events (e.g., storms, floods, wildfires, heatwaves and dust storms) will expose people to increased risks of climate-sensitive illnesses and injuries and, in the worst cases, higher mortality rates. Increased risks for mental health and well-being are associated with changes caused by the impacts of climate change on climate-sensitive health outcomes and systems (see Figure FAQ7.1.2). Higher temperatures and changing geographical and seasonal precipitation patterns will facilitate the spread of mosquito- and tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease and dengue fever, and water- and food-borne diseases. An increase in the frequency of extreme heat events will exacerbate health risks associated with cardiovascular disease and affect access to freshwater in multiple regions, impairing agricultural productivity and increasing food insecurity, undernutrition and poverty in low-income areas.</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer050"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-15" id="figure-7-faq-741" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_7_FAQ_7_1_1.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure FAQ7.1.1 |</span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>  Pathways from hazards, exposure and vulnerabilities to climate change impacts on health outcomes and health systems.</span><br>WBD: waterborne disease, VBD: Vector-borne disease, and FBD: Food-borne disease.</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><div class="Figure"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-21" id="figure-7-faq-7.1.2" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_7_FAQ_7_1_2.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure_title ParaOverride-11" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure FAQ7.1.2 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Climate change impacts on mental health and key adaptation responses. </span>PTSD: Post traumatic stress disorder.</p></div><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 7.2"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 7.2 | Will climate change lead to wide-scale forced migration and involuntary displacement?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-33-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Climate change will have impacts on future migration patterns that will vary by region and over time, depending on the types of climate risks people are exposed to, their vulnerability to those risks and their capacity—and the capacity of their governments—to adapt and respond. Depending on the range of adaptation options available, households may use migration as a strategy to adapt to climate risks, often through labour migration. The most common drivers of climate-related displacement are extreme weather events, floods and droughts, especially when these events cause severe damage to homes, livelihoods and food systems. Rising sea levels will present a new risk for communities situated in low-lying coastal areas and small island states. The greater the scale of future warming and extreme events, the greater the potential scale of future, involuntary climate-related migration and displacement.Progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has strong potential to reduce future involuntary climate-related migration and displacement.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 7.3"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 7.3 | Will climate change increase the potential for violent conflict?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-34-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Climate hazards have affected armed conflict within countries but the observed influence of climate is small relative to socioeconomic, political and cultural factors. Adverse impacts of climate change threaten to increase poverty and inequality, undermine progress in meetings Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and place strain on civil institutions—all of which are factors that contribute to the emergence or worsening of civil unrest and conflict. Climate change impacts on crop productivity and water availability can function as a ‘risk multiplier’ for conflict in areas that are already politically and/or socially fragile and, depending on circumstances, could increase the length or the nature of an existing conflict. Institutional initiatives within or between states to protect the environment and manage natural resources can serve simultaneously as mechanisms for engaging rival groups and adversaries to cooperate in policymaking and peacebuilding.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 7.4"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 7.4 | What solutions can effectively reduce climate change risks to health, well-being, forced migration and conflict? <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-33-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The solution space includes policies, strategies and programmes that consider why, how, when and who should be involved to sustainably adapt to climate change. Effectively preparing for and managing the health risks of climate change requires considering the multiple interacting sectors that affect population health and effective functioning of health systems. Considering the close inter-connections between health, migration and conflict, interventions that address climate risks in one area often have synergistic benefits in others. For example, conflicts often result in large numbers of people being involuntarily displaced and facilitate the spread of climate-sensitive diseases; tackling the underlying causes of vulnerability and exposure that generate conflict reduces risks across all areas. A key starting point for health and well-being is strengthening public health systems so that they become more climate resilient, which also requires cooperation with other sectors (water, food, sanitation, transportation, etc.) to ensure appropriate funding and progress on sustainable development goals. Interventions to enhance protection against specific climate-sensitive health risks could reduce morbidity and mortality and prevent many losses and damages (Figure FAQ7.4.1). These range from malaria net initiatives, vector control programmes, health hazard (syndromic) surveillance and early warning systems, improving access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), heat action plans (HAPs), behavioural changes and integration with disaster risk reduction (DRR) and response strategies. More importantly, climate resilient development pathways (CRDPs) are essential to improve overall health and well-being, reduce underlying causes of vulnerability and provide a framework for prioritising mitigation and adaptation options that support sustainable development. Transformative changes in key sectors including water, food, energy, transportation and built environments offer significant co-benefits for health.</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer050"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-15" id="figure-7-faq-741" loading="lazy" src="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_7_FAQ_7_4_1.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure FAQ7.4.1 |</span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>  Solution space for adaptation to climate change in health and other sectors.</span></p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 7.5"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 7.5 | What are some specific examples of actions taken in other sectors that reduce climate change risks in the health sector?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-35-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Many actions taken in other sectors to address the risks of climate change can lead to benefits for health and well-being. Adaptive urban design that provides greater access to green and natural spaces simultaneously enhances biodiversity, improves air quality and moderates the hydrological cycle; it also helps reduce health risks associated with heat stress and respiratory illnesses, and mitigates mental health challenges associated with congested urban living. Transitioning away from internal-combustion vehicles and fossil fuel-powered generating stations to renewable energy mitigates greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality and lowers the risks of respiratory illnesses. Policies and designs that facilitate active urban transport (walking and bicycling) increase efficiency in that sector, reduce emissions, improve air quality and generate physical and mental health benefits for residents. Improved building and urban design that foster energy efficiency improve indoor air quality and reduce risks of heat stress and respiratory illness. Food systems that emphasise healthy, plant-centred diets reduce emissions in the agricultural sector while helping in the fight against malnutrition.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="acknowledgements"><h1 class="References_References_head ParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">Acknowledgements </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-6-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The Lead Autors wish to recognize with thanks the research assistance and editorial assistance provided by Alyssa Gatt and Edi Cadham of Wilfrid Laurier University (Canada).</p></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_References_head ParaOverride-2" lang="en-GB"><span>References</span> </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-7-siblings"><p class="References_References_body" id="Alava--2017" lang="en-GB">Alava, J.
