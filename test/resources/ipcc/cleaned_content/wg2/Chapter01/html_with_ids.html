Adaptation limits can be soft or hard. Soft adaptation limits occur when options may exist but are currently not available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive actions. Hard adaptation limits occur when no adaptive actions are possible to avoid intolerable risks. The levels of GHG emissions reduction, adaptation and risk management measures are the key factors determining if and when adaptation limits are reached. When a limit (soft) is reached, then intolerable risks and impacts may occur and additional adaptations (incremental or transformational) would be required. Transformational adaptation can allow a system to extend beyond its soft limits and prevent soft limits from becoming hard limits. The loss and damage associated with the future climate change impacts, beyond the limits to adaptation, is an area of increasing focus. However, it is yet to be fully developed in terms of assessment methods, including non-economic values and identifying means to avoid and reduce both economic (loss of asset, infrastructure, land etc.) and non-economic (loss of societal beliefs and values, cultural heritage, biodiversity and ecosystem services) losses and damages. <!-- -->{1.4.4.1; 1.4.4.2}</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Key concepts in this report provide a framework for assessing the urgency of climate change adaptation. </span>Adaptation is urgent to the extent that soft adaptation limits are currently being approached or exceeded and that achieving levels of adaptation adequate to address these soft limits requires action at a speed and scale faster than that represented by current trends (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>).

AR6 has a particular focus on transformational adaptation, which changes the fundamental attributes of a socioeconomic system in anticipation of climate change and its impacts. AR6 describes transitions in five systems: energy, land and ecosystems, urban and infrastructure, industrial and societal.

If such a transformation is not pursued or is not successful and risk remains above intolerable levels, a forced transformation may occur that is less consistent with societal goals. The literature describes incremental and transformational change as linked processes. The transformational adaptation literature suggests shifts from incremental to transformational processes are made possible by knowledge and skills, as well adjustments to vision, agendas and coalitions achieved through monitoring and learning. The socio-ecological and sustainability transitions literature suggests that actors seeking deliberate transformation may take incremental steps that aim to induce societal tipping point behaviour in the near or longer term.

Two international agreements—the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—jointly provide overarching goals for climate action. The 2015 Paris Agreement frames direct local, national and private sector actions aligned with long-term goals addressing mitigation, adaptation and finance. For mitigation, the agreement calls for ‘holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels’, ‘pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C’ and ‘reaching net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the second half of this century’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2016">UNFCCC, 2016</a>). For adaptation, the agreement calls for ‘increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2016">UNFCCC, 2016</a>, Article 2), as well as having a dedicated ‘global goal on adaptation’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lesnikowski--2017">Lesnikowski et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Persson--2019">Persson, 2019</a>).

SDG 13 (‘Climate Action’) provides benchmarks to align the Paris Agreement’s call to ‘strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty’. Since AR5, several new international conventions have identified climate change adaptation and risk reduction as important global priorities for sustainable development, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tozier%20de%20la%20Poterie--2015">Tozier de la Poterie and Baudoin, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNISDR--2015">UNISDR, 2015</a>), the finance-oriented Addis Ababa Action Agenda (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN--2015">UN, 2015</a>) and the New Urban Agenda (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN--2017">UN, 2017</a>). For example, the SFDRR recognises some disasters as ‘exacerbated by climate change and increasing in frequency and intensity, significantly [impeding] progress towards sustainable development’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNISDR--2015">UNISDR, 2015</a>). The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is one of the key international legal instruments for sustainable development for ‘the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilisation of genetic resources’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#CBD--2011">CBD, 2011</a>). The CBD and its Aichi targets recognises that biodiversity is affected by climate change, with negative consequences for human well-being, but biodiversity, through ecosystem services, contributes to both climate change mitigation and adaptation (CBD, 2010). There is concern that many of the proposed post-2020 biodiversity targets of the CBD may not be met due to climate change impacts (post-2020 biodiversity targets from Chapter 2; <a class="reference-link" href="#Arneth--2020">Arneth et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.1.2 _p3">At the national level, over 2,315 laws and policies that address climate change now exist in 196 countries and a number of territories as of May 2021 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Grantham%20Research%20Institute%20on%20Climate%20Change%20and%20the%20Environment%20and%20Sabin%20Center%20for%20Climate%20Change%20Law--2021">Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, 2021</a>).

From a risk perspective (Section 1.2), emission reductions and carbon removal can both reduce GHG forcing and thus climate-related hazards, while adaptation and sustainable development reduce exposure and vulnerability to those hazards.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.1.3_p2">Important synergies and trade-offs exist among adaptation and mitigation actions (Section 1.5, Chapter 18). Limiting atmospheric concentrations of GHGs reduces the extent of adaptation needed to keep risk within tolerable levels (Section 1.3, Chapter 16). From a global perspective, understanding adaptation and its limits can inform judgements about the best balance among levels of mitigation and adaptation. Such judgements underlie the mitigation goals of the Paris Agreement. From a more local perspective, there is a wide range of mitigation scenarios (Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE in Chapter 1), including those which meet or miss the Paris Agreement goals, and overshoot scenarios in which global mean temperature exceed targets for several decades before dropping to desired levels. Such scenarios inform assessments of the level of adaptation that may be required (Section 1.4; Chapter 17).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.1.3_p3">Adaptation and sustainable development are also interlinked (Section 18.1). Adaptation facilitates development, which is hindered by impacts and risks from climate change. Development facilitates adaptation by expanding the resources and capacity available to manage climate risks. Viewed from a climate justice perspective, some argue that a more just society is more capable of successful adaptation, while others argue that only adaptation that results in a more just society can be judged successful (Section 1.4.1; Chapter 18).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.1.3_p4">Two concepts—adaptation gaps and limits to adaptation—help frame this report’s assessment of the extent to which current adaptation efforts are adequate to meet societal goals. <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Adaptation gaps</span> are defined as ‘the difference between actually implemented adaptation and a societally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to tolerated climate change impacts and reflecting resource limitations and competing priorities’ (UNEP et al., 2021). Limits to adaptation describe the extent to which no plausible level of adaptation can meet societal goals (Section 1.4.4). Within the limits, adaptation gaps can be closed by increased and more successful adaptation actions. Beyond the limits, only mitigation can close adaptation gaps.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.1.3_p5">Numerous climate-related impacts already cause severe damage in many places and are projected to increase in the future (Chapter 16). Adaptation can reduce these risks, often significantly, but limits to adaptation have already been reached or are being approached in some sectors and regions (Sections 16.3.1; 16.4). While natural systems worldwide are changing in response to climate change, many are not adapting sufficiently quickly to retain their resilience in the face of current and projected future climate change (Section 16.4). For human systems, numerous lines of evidence suggest that in many regions and sectors current infrastructure, settlement patterns, policies, practices and institutions remain inadequate for current changes in climate conditions (Section 16.2). Inadequate or insufficient adaptation to current conditions is called an adaptation deficit.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.1.3_p6">In response, adaptation efforts have increased significantly since AR5 (Sections 16.3; 17.2; 17.5.2; Cross-Chapter Box ADAPT in Chapter 1). Assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of these efforts as called for in Article 7 of the Paris Agreement remains challenging (Section 1.3.2.2), because much adaptation is not recorded in the literature and because assessment depends on judgements of effectiveness (Section 1.4.1.2), judgements about societal goals including climate justice (Section 1.4.1.1), and expectations about future GHG concentration pathways and other socioeconomic conditions (Section 16.5, Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.1.3_p7">Knowledge about adaptation has significantly expanded since AR5 (Cross-Chapter Box ADAPT in Chapter 1). While understanding regarding the extent of adaptation gaps remains limited, the available evidence suggests significant adaptation gaps exist (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Many current adaptation efforts constitute adaptation planning, rather than implementation (Section 16.3). Most current implementation efforts represent incremental as opposed to transformational adaptation despite the proximity to adaptation limits (Sections 17.2; 17.5.2). Some current adaptation efforts are considered maladaptive because they increase some climate-related risks even if they reduce others (Sections 1.4.2.4; 17.5; Chapter 16). Gaps exist in key enablers of adaptation, such as finance (Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE in Chapter 17). Given the long time scales involved with many adaptation actions and the potential to significantly reduce longer-term costs with near-term actions, closing many adaptation gaps requires actions over the next few years by governments, business, civil society and individuals at a scale and speed significantly faster than that represented by current trends.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-1.1"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 1.1 | Summary of IPCC AR5 and Special Report findings</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-18-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-1.1_p1">The IPCC WGII AR6 builds upon key findings of the IPCC AR5, three subsequent special reports and the simultaneous assessment of the IPCC WGI and WGIII AR6.

Building on a substantially expanded scientific and technical literature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Burkett--2014">Burkett et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Minx--2017">Minx et al., 2017</a>), this AR6 report emphasises at least three broad themes.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.1.4_p2">First, this AR6 assessment has an increased focus on risk- and solutions-frameworks. The risk framing can move beyond the limits of single best estimates or most-likely outcomes and include high-consequence outcomes for which probabilities are low or in some cases unknown (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2014">Jones et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2017">Mach and Field, 2017</a>). In this report, the risk framing for the first time spans all three Working Groups, includes risks from the responses to climate change, considers dynamic and cascading consequences (Section 1.3.1.1), describes with more geographic detail risks to people and ecosystems, and assesses such risks over a range of scenarios (Chapter 16). The focus on solutions encompasses the interconnections among climate responses, sustainable development, and transformation, and the implications for governance across scales within the public and private sectors (Section 17.5.2; Chapter 18). The assessment therefore includes climate-related decision making and risk management, climate resilient development pathways, implementation and evaluation of adaptation, and also limits to adaptation, and loss and damage (Cross-Chapter Box LOSS in Chapter 17; Section 1.4.4). Specific focal areas reflect contexts increasingly important for the implementation of responses, such as cities (Chapter 6).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.1.4_p3">Second, emphases on social justice and different forms of expertise have emerged (Sections 1.4.1.1; 17.5.2). As climate change impacts and implemented responses increasingly occur, there is heightened awareness of the ways that climate responses interact with issues of justice and social progress. In this report, there is expanded attention to inequity in climate vulnerability and responses, the role of power and participation in processes of implementation, unequal and differential impacts, and climate justice. The historic focus on scientific literature has also been increasingly accompanied by attention to and incorporation of Indigenous knowledge (IK), local knowledge (LK) and associated scholars (Section 1.3.2.3; Chapter 12).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.1.4_p4">Third, AR6 has a more extensive focus on the role of transformation in meeting societal goals (Section 1.5).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.1.4_p5">To support these three themes, this report assesses literature with an increasing diversity of topics and geographical areas covered. The diversity is encompassed through sectoral and regional chapters (Chapters 2–15), as well as cross-chapter papers and boxes. The literature also increasingly evaluates the lived experiences of climate change—the physical changes underway, the impacts for people and ecosystems, the perceptions of the risks, and adaptation and mitigation responses planned and implemented. In particular, scientific capabilities to attribute individual extreme weather and climate events to GHG emissions have gone from hypothetical to standard and routine over the last three decades, and societal perceptions of these events and their impacts for people and ecosystems are now being studied as well (Figure 1.1; Cross-Working Group Box ATTRIBUTION in Chapter 1; see synthesis in Chapter 16).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.1.4_p6">Finally, climate change assessment has become increasingly integrative across multiple disciplines within the natural and social sciences. This report’s chapters combine experts across Working Groups and disciplines, such as natural and social sciences, engineering, humanities, law, and business administration. In this assessment cycle, the special reports (<a class="reference-link" href="#Allen--2018">Allen et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019a">IPCC, 2019a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>) all emphasise such integration, and the chapter teams in the present report integrate disciplinary perspectives and also science–policy interactions inherent in climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. There has been increasing real-time assessment of the assessment process itself, including interpersonal dynamics and how they shape key findings (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2019">Oppenheimer et al., 2019</a>). Additionally, best practices are being adopted from applied decision and policy analysis, decision support and co-production, in order to increase assessment relevance and usability for decision making (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hall--2019">Hall et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2019">Mach et al., 2019</a>). Methods of integration in this report include systematic review, meta-analysis, multi-criteria integration and expert elicitation (see synthesis in Chapter 16). The emphasis on knowledge for action has also included the role of public communication, stories and narratives within assessment and associated outreach (Section 1.2.2).</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="1.2"><h1 class="Headings_H1-numbered" lang="en-GB">1.2 Different Entry Points for Understanding Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-3-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2_p1">This section introduces key concepts used in this report and the connections between them that present different entry points for understanding climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability.</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="1.2.1"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">1.2.1 Overlapping, Complementary Entry Points <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-5-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.1_p1">Many actors from different research and practice communities engage with understanding and responding to climate risk.

Key concepts used in this report help illuminate our current situation and potential solutions. These key concepts are usefully organised around the concepts of risk, solutions and transformation. Risk can prompt solutions and transformation. Both solutions and transformation seek to reduce some risks but may also generate others.

Key concepts that contribute to an understanding of feasible, effective, and just solutions (1.4.1) include the enablers of governance, finance and knowledge (Section 1.4.2); Transformation is supported by systems transitions in energy, land, infrastructure, industry and society (Section 1.5.1), which if successful can contribute to climate resilient development (Section 1.5).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.1_p7">The centre of Figure 1.2 shows societal goals of equity, health, well-being and climate justice as articulated by the Paris Agreement, SDGs, and other policies and plans (Section 1.4.1).

The concept of adaptation can provide a unique window into the process of adjustment to climate change by human and natural systems (Section 1.2.1.3). Resilience (Section 1.3.1.4) is a broad concept, encompassing both outcomes and processes, an ability to maintain essential function and an ability to transform.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.1_p9">The ball and cup diagrams (<a class="reference-link" href="#Holling--1973">Holling, 1973</a>) in Figure 1.2 indicate that the current coupled human and natural system is not resilient, nor does it meet societal goals of equity, well-being and ecosystem health.

In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions between climate-related hazards with the exposure and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system. In the context of climate change responses, risks result from the potential for such responses not achieving the intended objective(s), or from potential trade-offs or negative side effects (see Annex II: Glossary). <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Risk management </span> is defined as plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks (see Annex II: Glossary).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.1.1_p2">Risk framing is increasingly used to assess climate change impacts on human and natural systems (Sections 1.2.4.1; 16.1; 17.3; Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE in Chapter 1; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2012">IPCC, 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2017">Mach and Field, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2017"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2017">O’Neill et al., 2017</a> ; <a class="reference-link" href="#Connelly--2018">Connelly et al., 2018</a>; see also <a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2014">Oppenheimer et al., 2014</a>). A risk framing reflects key dimensions of the climate challenge. These features include the changing likelihoods of many different outcomes (including adverse consequences and beneficial opportunities), uncertainties that will persist, and different and contested values, priorities and goals (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2011">Jones and Preston, 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2016">Mach et al., 2016</a>). The IPCC AR6 and associated special reports apply a broad definition of risk. WGI Cross-Chapter Box 1.3. WGI uses the Climatic Impact Driver terminology, rather than hazard, to neutrally assess changing climatic conditions that are relevant to human and natural systems, leaving the determination of positive/negative consequences and resulting impacts and risks for WGII assessment (WGI Section 12.3). In most cases, throughout this WGII report, the term ‘risk’ refers to the risks of climate change impacts. The full assessment, however, incorporates all relevant risks from climate change impacts and responses.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.1.1_p3">The broad definition of risk involves quantitative and integrative understandings of risk ( <a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2014">Oppenheimer et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2017">Mach and Field, 2017</a>; see also Section 17.3). Risk is sometimes defined as the probability of a consequence, multiplied by the magnitude of that consequence, acknowledging both the diversity of possible consequences and the relevance of values. Yet it also applies in circumstances where probabilities cannot be fully quantified (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Adger--2013">Adger et al., 2013</a>). For example, in some cases the probability and magnitude of consequences may be more uncertain, dependent on complex dimensions of the climate (e.g., a cyclone, high tide, and heatwave co-occurring) or the vulnerability of different communities (e.g., the ways in which social networks and community cohesion support the most vulnerable individuals during disasters) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ford--2018">Ford et al., 2018</a>). The determinants of risk vary dynamically through space and time (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jurgilevich--2017">Jurgilevich et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Viner--2020">Viner et al., 2020</a>).

First, risk framing connects the present with the future. (Papathoma-Kohle et al., 2016). For instance, whether wildfire or drought, recent experiences have demonstrated limits to current response capacities relevant to future preparedness (e.g., evacuation of large communities on tight time frames or water management simultaneously responsive to intensifying drought and flooding). Second, risk framing emphasises that uncertainties and complex interactions are integral to decision making (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2014">Jones et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dawson--2015">Dawson, 2015</a>). The uncertainties include high-impact, low-probability outcomes and deep uncertainties for which core processes are not understood and meaningful probabilities cannot be applied (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adler--2016">Adler et al., 2016</a>; see also Section 17.2.1; Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17; <a class="section-link" data-title="The Earth’s Energy Budget, Climate Feedbacks, and Climate Sensitivity" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-7">Chapter 7</a> in SRCCL, <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019a">IPCC, 2019a</a>; Cross-Chapter Box 5 in SROCC, <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>).

Vulnerability in this report is defined as the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. It encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt (see Annex II: Glossary). Over the past several decades, approaches to analysing and assessing vulnerability have evolved. An early emphasis on top-down, biophysical evaluation of vulnerability included—and often started with—exposure to climate hazards in assessing vulnerability. From this starting point, attention to bottom-up, social and contextual determinants of vulnerability, which often differ, has emerged, although this approach is incompletely applied or integrated across contexts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bergstrand--2015">Bergstrand et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rufat--2015">Rufat et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Spielman--2020">Spielman et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Taberna--2020">Taberna et al., 2020</a>). Vulnerability is now widely understood to differ within communities and across societies, also changing through time (Kienberger et al., 2013; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jurgilevich--2017">Jurgilevich et al., 2017</a>; see also Chapter 16). In the WGII AR6, assessment of the vulnerability of people and ecosystems encompasses the differing approaches that exist within the literature, both critiquing and harmonising them based on available evidence. In this context, <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">exposure</span> is defined as the presence of people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services, and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected (Annex II: Glossary). Potentially affected places and settings can be defined geographically, as well as more dynamically, for example through transmission or interconnections through markets or flows of people.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.1.2_p2">Vulnerability is also a link between the climate risk and disaster risk communities, recognising complementarities and differences between these communities. <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Disaster risk management </span> is the set of processes that improve understanding of disaster risk, foster disaster risk reduction and transfer, and promote continuous improvement in disaster preparedness, response and recovery practices, increasing human security, well-being and sustainable development (see Annex II: Glossary). Climate risk and disaster risk are increasingly addressed together, bridging the climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction communities (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2012">IPCC, 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNDRR--2019">UNDRR, 2019</a>, especially Chapter 13 in that report). Building on the scientific literature and adaptation and risk reduction practice, the IPCC Special Report on Extremes resulted in several major IPCC advances that continue through the present report, including emphasis on risk and climate-related extremes (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Burton--2012">Burton et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lavell--2012">Lavell et al., 2012</a>) and re-conceptualisation of vulnerability to encompass both social and biophysical orientations (i.e., bridging contextual/bottom-up and climate-driven/top-down approaches) (<a class="reference-link" href="#polsky--2007">Polsky et al., 2007</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cardona--2012">Cardona et al., 2012</a>). Linking disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation can also be an important basis for discussion in climate negotiations on the allocation of funds needed for tackling climate change, especially in developing countries and SIDS (<a class="reference-link" href="#Begum--2014">Begum et al., 2014</a>). The integration of disaster risk management and climate change adaptation in the IPCC AR6 is seen, for example, in the assessment of key risks within and across sectors and regions, along with global-scale reasons for concern, which is attuned to extreme events and disasters (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2014">Oppenheimer et al., 2014</a>; see also Chapter 16). Additionally, the assessment of adaptation has prioritised these interconnections (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Mimura--2014">Mimura et al., 2014</a>), as have literature and practice especially in the context of sustainable development (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Schipper--2016">Schipper et al., 2016</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="1.2.1.3"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">1.2.1.3 Adaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-3-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.1.3_p1"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Adaptation</span> in this report is defined, in human systems, as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects (see Annex II: Glossary). Adaptation planning in human systems generally entails a process of iterative risk management. Different types of adaptation have been distinguished, including anticipatory versus reactive, autonomous versus planned and incremental versus transformational adaptation (Chapters 16–18; IPCC WGII glossaries for the TAR, AR4, AR5, and AR6 (Annex II)). Adaptation is often seen as having five general stages: (a) awareness, (b) assessment, (c) planning, (d) implementation and (e) M&amp;E (<a class="reference-link" href="#Moser--2013">Moser and Boykoff, 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2014">Jones et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mimura--2014">Mimura et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Noble--2014">Noble et al., 2014</a>; see also Section 17.4). Government, non-government and private sector actors have adopted a wide variety of specific approaches to adaptation that, to varying degrees, address these five general stages. Adaptation in natural systems includes ‘autonomous’ adjustments through ecological and evolutionary processes. It also involves the use of nature through ecosystem-based adaptation. The role of species, biodiversity and ecosystems in such adaptation options can range from the rehabilitation or restoration of ecosystems (e.g., wetlands or mangroves) to hybrid combinations of ‘green and grey’ infrastructure (e.g., horizontal levees) (Chapters 2 and 3; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPBES--2018">IPBES, 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.1.3_p2">The IPCC assessment of adaptation has evolved through time. The WGII AR4 included one chapter dedicated to adaptation, the WGII AR5 expanded to four and the WGII AR6 mainstreams adaptation comprehensively throughout the report. Adaptation science is rapidly evolving, including evaluation of adaptation effectiveness, feasibility, implementation and maladaptation, although major knowledge gaps persist in modelling and analysis (Cross-Chapter Box ADAPT in Chapter 1; Chapter 16; Section 1.4; <a class="reference-link" href="#Holman--2019">Holman et al., 2019</a>). The WGII AR6 emphasises assessment of observed adaptation-related responses to climate change, governance and decision making in adaptation, and the role of adaptation in reducing key risks and global-scale reasons for concern, as well as limits to such adaptation (e.g., Chapters 16 and 17). The assessment approach includes adaptation needs, options, planning and implementation across sectors and regions, as well as adaptation opportunities, constraints and also limits (<a class="reference-link" href="#Eisenack--2014">Eisenack et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Klein--2014b">Klein et al., 2014b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Oberlack--2014">Oberlack and Eisenack, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lehmann--2015">Lehmann et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roggero--2015">Roggero, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Herrmann--2017">Herrmann and Guenther, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Oberlack--2017">Oberlack, 2017</a>; Sieber et al., 2018; <a class="reference-link" href="#Moser--2019b">Moser et al., 2019b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Capela%20Louren%C3%A7o--2019">Capela Lourenço et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Thaler--2019">Thaler et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Russel--2020">Russel et al., 2020</a>; see also Chapters 16 and 17).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.1.3_p3">Since AR5, more adaptation has progressed (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lesnikowski--2016">Lesnikowski et al., 2016</a>; see also Sections 16.2.5 and 17.2) and the focus of activity has expanded to include social, institutional and governance dimensions beyond engineered and technical options and to decision processes beyond technocratic, linear framings (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>; see also Chapter 17). Adaptation includes increasing attention to implementation, M&amp;E and learning through time, not just planning processes (Section 17.3 and 17.5.1). On the one hand, an important advance has been recognition of generalised capacities, such as resources and knowledge, necessary for the feasibility of effective adaptation. Adaptation thereby strongly overlaps with risk management and with the building of resilience and sustainable development (Chapters 17 and 18).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="1.2.1.4 "><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">1.2.1.4 Resilience, Including Connections with Development Pathways and Transformation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-4-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.1.4 _p1"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Resilience</span> in this report is defined as the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation (see Annex II: Glossary). Resilience is an entry point commonly used, although under a wide spectrum of meanings (<a class="reference-link" href="#Reghezza-Zitt--2012">Reghezza-Zitt et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Flood--2014">Flood and Schechtman, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Aldunce--2015">Aldunce et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tanner--2015">Tanner et al., 2015</a>; Fisichelli et al., 2016; Meerow et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Moser--2019a">Moser et al., 2019a</a>). Resilience as a system trait overlaps with concepts of vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and thereby risk. Resilience as a strategy overlaps with risk management, adaptation and also transformation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Woodruff--2018">Woodruff et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Moser--2019a">Moser et al., 2019a</a>). Implemented adaptation is often organised around resilience as bouncing back and returning to a previous state after a disturbance (Fisichelli et al., 2016).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.1.4 _p2">In much of the literature, resilience encompasses not just maintaining essential function, identity and structure, but also maintaining a capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. Since the earliest framings of resilience around stability and persistence, ecology and allied fields have come to recognise that while systems are often persistent in the face of disturbance, disturbance also creates opportunity for transformation and the emergence of new pathways (Section 1.5.2; <a class="reference-link" href="#Folke--2006">Folke, 2006</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Allen--2010">Allen and Holling, 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Folke--2010">Folke et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gelcich--2010">Gelcich et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Stockholm%20Resilience%20Center--2015">Stockholm Resilience Center, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Doppelt--2017">Doppelt, 2017</a>). Across this literature, disturbance is framed as outside the system in question, for which the time frames and spatial scales of disturbances, impacts and responses are central to outcomes (<a class="reference-link" href="#B%C3%A9n%C3%A9--2011">Béné et al., 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Brown--2014">Brown, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hamborg--2020">Hamborg et al., 2020</a>).

In the last 5 years (2016–2020), the concept of resilience has gained prominence as a core theme in the climate change adaptation literature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nalau--2021">Nalau and Verrall, 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.1.4 _p3">Often, development and adaptation communities of practice default to persistence and stability in their use of resilience (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cote--2012">Cote and Nightingale, 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#MacKinnon--2013">MacKinnon and Derickson, 2013</a>). Such a framing aligns resilience with a long-standing but increasingly questioned belief that sustainable development can be achieved through incremental adjustments in behaviour and advances in technology that allow for the persistence of existing socioeconomic and socio-ecological arrangements (<a class="reference-link" href="#Klauer--1999">Klauer, 1999</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Banerjee--2003">Banerjee, 2003</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Redclift--2005">Redclift, 2005</a>; UN Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development 2019; Chapter 18, Section 1.5). However, the literature increasingly suggests that the achievement of sustainable development will require transformative change in socio-ecological systems at scales ranging from the community to the globe. The concept of climate resilient development, initially introduced in AR5 and now a key focus in this report (see Chapter 18), engages with such transformations and the associated questions of justice, power and politics as shaped by internal, endogenous social factors and their interactions with other drivers of change (Eriksen et al., 2015; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nightingale--2015b">Nightingale, 2015b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Carr--2019">Carr, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nightingale--2019">Nightingale et al., 2019</a>; see also Chapter 18).</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="cross-chapter-box-climate"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE | Climate Reference Periods, Global Warming Levels and Common Climate Dimensions</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-19-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Authors: Steven Rose (USA), Richard Betts (UK), Philippus Wester (Nepal/the Netherlands), Aris Koutroulis (Greece)</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">This Cross-Chapter Box sets out common climate dimensions to contextualise and facilitate AR6 WGII analyses, presentation, synthesis and communication of assessed, observed and projected climate change impacts across WGII chapters and cross-chapter papers. ‘Common climate dimensions’ are defined as common global warming levels (GWLs), time periods and levels of other variables, as needed by WGII authors for consistent communications. The set of climate variable ranges given below was derived from the AR6 WGI report and supporting resources, and helps to contextualise and inform the projection of potential future climate impacts and key risks.

The IPCC Glossary (2021b) defines the pre-industrial period as ‘the multi-century period prior to the onset of large-scale industrial activity around 1750. The reference period 1850–1900 is used to approximate pre-industrial global mean surface temperature (GMST).’ The ‘modern’ period is defined as 1995 to 2014 in AR6, while three future reference periods are used for presenting climate change projections, namely near term (2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060) and long term (2081–2100), in both the AR6 WGI and WGII reports. Importantly, the historical rate of warming assessed by WGI in AR6 is different to that assessed in AR5 and Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5, <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018b">IPCC, 2018b</a>), due to methodological updates (see WGI Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 in <a class="section-link" data-title="Changing State of the Climate System" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2">Chapter 2</a> for details (Gulev, 2021)). This means that the ‘modern’ period is assessed as slightly warmer compared to 1850–1900 than it would have been with AR5-era methods. This also has implications for the projected timing of reaching policy-relevant levels of global warming, which need to be understood.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">To explore and investigate climate futures, climate change projections are developed using sets of different input projections. These consist of sets of projections of GHG emissions, aerosols or aerosol precursor emissions, land use change, and concentrations designed to facilitate evaluation of a large climate space and enable climate modelling experiments. For AR5 (and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) 5 climate model experiments), the input projections were referred to as representative concentration pathways (RCPs). For AR6 (and the CMIP6 climate model experiments), new sets of inputs are used and referred to as SSP scenarios, where SSP refers to socioeconomic assumptions called the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">The RCPs are a set of four trajectories that span a large radiative forcing range, defined as increased energy input at surface level in Watts per square metre, ranging from 2.6 W m <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>-2</span> (RCP2.6) to 8.5 W m <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>-2</span> (RCP8.5) by the end of the 21st century, with RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 as intermediate scenarios, and RCP2.6 a peak and decline scenario reaching 3 W m <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>-2</span> before 2100. A range of emissions scenarios compatible with each specific RCP was also assessed in AR5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ciais--2013">Ciais et al., 2013</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">A core set of five SSP scenarios, namely SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, was selected in the AR6 WGI report to fill certain gaps identified in the RCPs (see WGI Cross-Chapter Box 1.4 in <a class="section-link" data-title="Framing, Context and Methods" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-1">Chapter 1</a> (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2021">Chen et al., 2021</a>)). The first number in the label is the particular set of socioeconomic assumptions driving the emissions and other climate forcing inputs taken up by climate models and the second number is the radiative forcing level reached in 2100. WG1 Cross-Chapter Box 1.4 in <a class="section-link" data-title="Framing, Context and Methods" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-1">Chapter 1</a> provides a comparison of this core set of SSP scenarios with scenarios used in previous reports, with SSP1–1.9 a low overshoot scenario consistent with limiting global average warming to 1.5°C, and SSP1-2.6 a scenario consistent with limiting warming to 2°C.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Also of importance to the impact literature and the WGII report are SSP-RCP combinations, that is, studies that employ climate outcomes based on RCPs and socio-economic assumptions based on SSPs. SSPs can be paired with a range of different RCPs because SSPs can be combined with mitigation policy assumptions to produce a range of emissions pathways. In addition to the SSPs, there are many other emissions pathways and societies consistent with any global mean temperature outcome. These represent uncertainty and broad ranges of possibilities that affect climate change exposure and vulnerability (Rose and and M. Scott, 2020; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rose--2018">Rose and Scott, 2018</a>). Furthermore, there are large uncertainties in translating emissions scenarios into concentration pathways due to uncertainties in climate-carbon cycle feedbacks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2013">Jones et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Booth--2017">Booth et al., 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">The plausibility of emissions levels as high as the emissions scenario conventionally associated with the RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5 concentration pathways has been called into question since AR5, as has the emissions pathway feasibility of the low scenarios (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hausfather--2020">Hausfather and Peters, 2020</a>; Rose and and Scott, 2020). However, these views are contested (Schwalm et al., 2020, for RCP8.5) It is important to realise that emissions scenarios and concentration pathways are not the same thing and higher concentration pathways, such as RCP8.5 could arise from lower emissions scenarios if carbon cycle feedbacks are stronger than assumed in the integrated assessment models (IAMs) used to create the standard scenarios (<a class="reference-link" href="#Booth--2017">Booth et al., 2017</a>). In the majority of full-complexity Earth System Models, these feedbacks are stronger than in the IAMs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2013">Jones et al., 2013</a>), so the RCP8.5 concentration pathway cannot be ruled out purely through consideration of the economic aspects of emissions scenarios. Nonetheless, the likelihood of a climate outcome, and the overall distribution of climate outcomes, are a function of the emissions scenario’s likelihood. Note that the original RCPs were created explicitly to facilitate a broad range of climate modelling experiments, with the expectation that other issues, such as socioeconomic uncertainty, could be subsequently explored (<a class="reference-link" href="#Moss--2010">Moss et al., 2010</a>).</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1"><div class="Box_Header-continued" id="_idContainer010"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_continued-subhead" lang="en-GB">Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE1</p></div></div><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">An important feature of the AR6 cycle is a stronger emphasis on the use of future GWLs to support consistency and comparability across the three IPCC Working Groups’ contributions to the AR6 and improve communication. The common range of GWLs relative to the 1850 to 1900 period, termed the ‘Tier 1’ range by WGI, are 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0°C. The use of GWLs assists in the comparison of climate states across climate change scenarios (projections) and in assessing the broader literature, as well as for cross-chapter and cross-working group comparisons. They facilitate the integration of climate projections, impacts, adaptation challenges and mitigation challenges within and across the three Working Groups as there is a close connection between the level of global warming and climate change impacts. Of particular interest is the timing of when the ‘Tier 1’ GWLs are reached, relative to the period 1850–1900, under the five SSP x–y scenarios, as well as RCP scenarios. For climate change impacts and adaptation responses, linking GWLs to RCP and SSP climate projections using a climate information translation resource is of great relevance for the WGII contribution to AR6.</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1"><div class="Box_Header-continued" id="_idContainer011"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_continued-subhead" lang="en-GB">Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE1</p></div></div><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H1" lang="en-GB">AR6 WGII Common Climate Dimensions</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">WGII’s common climate dimensions include (a) a common range of GWLs from WGI, (b) common ranges for other climate variables, (c) information for translating climate variable levels to climate projections and vice versa. See Table Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE.1 for global warming level ranges by time periods for RCP and SSP climate projections, and Table Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE.2 for information regarding the timing for when GWLs are reached in climate projections. The common GWL range is based on WGI’s ‘Tier 1’ dimensions of integration range: 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C. The first table illustrates the greater levels of projected global warming with higher emissions pathways, as well as the increasing uncertainty in the climate response over time for a given pathway. The second table illustrates significant uncertainty in the timing for passing GWL thresholds which can narrow for a given GWL, the higher the emissions pathway. Finally, given the importance of geographic heterogeneity in projected changes in future climate, Table Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE.3a and 3b are provided with ranges for select climate variables (temperature, precipitation, ocean) by GWL and continent (or ocean biome). The ranges illustrate spatial heterogeneity in potential physical changes in levels and uncertainty that are relevant to assessing climate impacts risk.

Given differences in available literature, WGII chapters and CCPs (cross-chapter papers) contextualise impacts with respect to exposure, vulnerability and adaptation as appropriate.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Common ranges for other ‘climate’ variables, such as minimum and maximum temperatures and regional climates, are available based on WGI projections. They are based on feasible combinations with GWLs taken into consideration using the WGI Interactive Atlas. Climate information translation may have been necessary within chapters for mapping the WGII literature and assessments of the common climate dimensions. WGII’s climate impacts literature is based primarily on climate projections around AR5 and earlier or assumed temperature levels, though some recent impacts literature uses newer climate projections based on the CMIP6 exercise. Thus, it was important to be able to map climate variable levels to climate projections of different vintages and vice versa and adjust variables, when possible, to a common reference year. WGII chapters and CCPs only provide climate impact information for the common climate dimensions that their literature supports and where there is sufficient evidence.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H1" lang="en-GB">Interpretation of the update in projected time of reaching 1.5°C global warming from SR1.5 to AR6</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">In an assessment using multiple lines of evidence, including models, observational constraints and improved understanding of climate sensitivity, WGI project a central estimate of the 20-year average warming crossing the 1.5°C GWL in the early 2030s in all scenarios assessed, except SSP5–8.5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lee--2021">Lee et al., 2021</a>). This is about 10 years earlier than the midpoint of the likely range (2030–2052) assessed in SR1.5, which assumed continuation of the observed warming rate reported at that time. However, this does not imply that the projected impacts of 1.5°C will be reached 10 years earlier, because roughly half of the 10-year difference is a result of updating the diagnosed historical rate of warming due to methodological advances, new datasets and other improvements (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gulev--2021">Gulev et al., 2021</a>). The other half of the 10-year difference arises because, for central estimates of climate sensitivity, most scenarios show stronger warming over the near term than was assessed as ‘current’ in SR1.5 (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">The revised historical warming rate does not necessarily contribute to a change in timing of estimated impacts. It depends on how impacts are calculated relative to climate. Because the revised historical warming results in a redefinition of the 1.5°C GWL relative to the modern time period (1995–2014) rather than a different level of overall change (Figure Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE.2 in Chapter 1), impacts assessed relative to the modern time period are unaffected. There are, in effect ‘old’ and ‘new’ definitions of the 1.5°C GWL with different levels of impacts, and the impacts assessed for the ‘old’ 1.5°C GWL now apply to a different level of global warming. However, the timing of impacts assessed relative to pre-industrial (e.g., aggregate economic impact estimates), are affected and we are closer to impact levels associated with 1.5°C and 2°C.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">To illustrate with a worked example: in SR1.5, the historical warming between 1850–1900 and the modern period of 2006–2015 was assessed as 0.87°C, implying that the 1.5°C GWL would be accompanied by impacts associated with 0.63°C warming from the modern period. However, AR6 WGI (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gulev--2021">Gulev et al., 2021</a>) revised the assessment of warming between 1850–1900 and 2006–2015 to 0.94°C, implying that the 1.5°C GWL would be accompanied by a slightly lower level of impacts associated with only 0.56°C warming from the modern period. So, while the redefined 1.5°C GWL would be reached earlier, it would also be accompanied by a lower level of impacts (Figure Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE.2 in Chapter 1). The impacts associated with the ‘old’ 1.5°C GWL would now be seen at 1.57°C global warming relative to 1850–1900, reached at the time of the ‘old’ 1.5°C GWL, if the same future level of warming were to be used as in SR1.5.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">However, in addition to this redefinition of the historical warming rate, the assessed future warming in AR6 is also slightly faster than the continuation of reported recent warming used in SR1.5. This means that both the ‘old’ and ‘new’ 1.5°C GWLs are projected to be reached earlier than they would have been using the SR1.5 method. This and the revised historical warming diagnosis contribute approximately equally to the assessment of 1.5°C global warming being reached about 10 years earlier than projected in SR1.5.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Central estimates of impacts associated with a specifically defined 1.5°C GWL could therefore be considered to be projected to be reached approximately 5 years earlier than implied by SR1.5. However, uncertainties in regional climate responses at a given GWL are large (Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE in Chapter 1, Table CLIMATE.3a) and natural climate variability occurs in parallel with ongoing warming, so the potential for impacts higher than central estimates could be a more urgent consideration for risk assessments and adaptation planning than the earlier projected timing of reaching 1.5°C (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). It should also be noted that individual years may exceed 1.5°C above 1850–1900 sooner, but this is not the same as exceedance of the 1.5°C GWL which refers to the 20-year mean.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_Figure" lang="en-GB"></p><p class="ParaOverride-3" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" id="figure-1-cross-chapter-box-climate-2" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_1_Cross-Chapter_Box_CLIMATE_2.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_Figure_title"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE.2 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Definitions of the 1</span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>. </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>5°C global warming level (GWL) in SR1.5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018b">IPCC, 2018b</a>) and AR6 WGI (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2021a">IPCC, 2021a</a>). </span>GWLs are defined relative to 1850–1900 but impacts at the GWL are typically assessed in association with warming relative to a modern period 1995–2014, which in SR1.5 was 2006–2015. Revised assessment of the historical warming between 1850–1900 and the modern period (0.87°C in SR1.5 to 0.94°C in AR6) has the effect of slightly reducing the warming between the modern period and the 1.5°C GWL (0.63°C in SR1.5 to 0.56°C in AR6), and the impacts at the GWL previously defined as 1.5°C in SR1.5 now occur at 1.57°C global warming with the AR6 definition.

Storylines are used to assess risks related to low-likelihood, but high-impact events (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sutton--2018">Sutton, 2018</a>). In this use of the terms, narratives and storylines do not include specific actors. There is also a critical literature on the use of narratives and storylines based on projected scenarios, which points out the conservative character of these concepts whose performative effect tends to preserve the status quo and the current socioeconomic relationships.

Although mathematical models and narratives are often presumed to be antithetical, in practice they may be complementary and work together (<a class="reference-link" href="#Morgan--2017">Morgan and Wise, 2017</a>). Communicating research insights through storylines and narratives may have a better chance of transmitting key messages. AR6 employs these communication tools in many places, for instance storylines for constructing and communicating regional climate information or climate services (WGI AR6 Chapter 10, <a class="reference-link" href="#Doblas-Reyes--2021">Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021</a>; WGI AR6 Chapter 12, <a class="reference-link" href="#Ranasinghe--2021">Ranasinghe et al., 2021</a>) or ‘low likelihood high warming storylines’ (Chapter 4). To better communicate deep uncertainty in sea level rise projections, WGI uses storylines to describe the physical events that would have to unfold to generate its high-end estimates (Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.2_p5"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Scenarios</span> are defined in IPCC reports as plausible descriptions of how the future may develop, based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces (e.g., rate of technological change, prices) and relationships (Annex II: Glossary). Scenarios are neither predictions nor forecasts but rather ‘foresights’, which imply envisioning challenging futures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vervoort--2018">Vervoort and Gupta, 2018</a>). Scenarios are used to provide a view of the potential consequences and implications of developments and actions in a ‘what-if’ mode of exploring the future (AR6 WGIII Section 1.5.1; AR6 WGI Section 1.6.1, <a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2021">Chen et al., 2021</a>). They may be presented as numerical or mental models. Climate change scenarios are generated by climate modellers to highlight possible alternative GHG emission pathways and are used to develop and integrate projections of emissions and their climate change impacts and for analysing and contrasting climate policy choices. Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE in <a class="section-link" data-title="Framing, Context and Methods" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-1">Chapter 1</a> describes scenarios used in this report.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.2.2_p6">Pathways are one element of a larger scenario (<a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2017"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2017">O’Neill et al., 2017</a> ), focusing on just one element of a larger system of drivers, emissions or concentrations. Scenarios provide one means to represent deep uncertainty when there is disagreement or uncertainty about conceptual models (Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>). In addition, scenarios provide several important functions in decision support. A lack of strong association with probabilities enables scenarios to promote buy-in from parties to a decision who hold different expectations about the future, helping them to expand the range of futures and options they consider. The process of generating scenarios can serve as the focus of participatory stakeholder exercises and processes, and scenarios can also be used to support risk management by stress-testing alternative policies and identifying robust and adaptive policies under conditions of deep uncertainty (Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17).</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="1.3"><h1 class="Headings_H1-numbered" lang="en-GB">1.3 Understanding and Evaluating Climate Risks </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-4-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3_p1">Understanding of climate change has advanced in important ways that shape the AR6 assessment.

AR6 assesses the serious, complex and cascading climate risks unfolding across sectors and regions. These risks are shaped by many societal factors including cultural norms and social practice, socioeconomic development, underlying physical and social vulnerability, and societal responses themselves (Section 1.2.1.1). Throughout, there is increased attention to the important role of different forms of knowledge, especially IK and LK, in the understanding and the management of the changing climate.</p><div class="h3-container" id="1.3.1.1"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">1.3.1.1 The Nature of Climate Risk as Assessed in this Report <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-5-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.1.1_p1">Greater understanding of climate-related risks is emerging; however, there are important shortcomings in the information for some regions and sectors, and for developing versus developed countries. These risks assume significance in interaction with the cultures, values, ethics, identities, experiences, and knowledge systems of affected communities and societies, as well as their governance, finances, capabilities and resources. The key risk assessment in the IPCC AR5 informed the long-term temperature goal in the 2015 Paris Agreement—limiting the increase in global mean temperature to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts towards limiting warming to 1.5°C (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2014">Oppenheimer et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pachauri--2014)">Pachauri et al., 2014)</a>. The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, responding to an invitation by UNFCCC, used new scientific information to provide a specific risk assessment associated with the ambitious warming levels targeted by the Paris Agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hoegh-Guldberg--2019">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019</a>). The Special Reports on Oceans and Land further advanced the methods of transparent risk assessment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zommers--2020">Zommers et al., 2020</a>). The current assessment expands significantly from the previous reports, aiming to inform and advance understanding of the following core themes: (a) the ways changes in vulnerability and exposure modulate risks of climate change impacts and risk complexity in addition to warming; (b) the knowledge basis relevant to continued refinement of temperature goals; (c) the effectiveness of adaptation solutions; (d) the management of risks at higher levels of warming, should ambitious climate change mitigation be unsuccessful, including limits to adaptation; and (e) the benefits of climate change mitigation and emissions reductions (Section 16.1).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.1.1_p2">This report evaluates key risks—potentially severe risks—meriting society’s full attention globally and regionally across sectors, in order to inform judgements about dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2014">Oppenheimer et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2016">Mach et al., 2016</a>; see also Sections 16.1.2; 16.4; WGI Section 1.2.4.1). As described detail in Chapter 16, evaluation of key risks is based on expert judgement applied to all relevant lines of evidence, with a focus on the role of societal values in determining the importance of a risk. Specific criteria considered relate to the magnitude of adverse consequences, including the potential for irreversibility, thresholds, or cascading effects; the likelihood of adverse consequences; the timing of the risk; and the ability to respond to the risk (Section 16.5.1).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.1.1_p3">The key risk assessment conveys increasing urgency given the growing visibility of climate change impacts in the current world (Sections 1.1; 16.1). Representative key risks emerging across sectors and regions include risks to coastal socio-ecological systems and terrestrial and ocean ecosystems; risks associated with critical infrastructure, networks and services; risks to living standards and human health; risks to food and water security; and risks to peace and migration (Section 16.5). Compared to the AR5, the emphasis on human dimensions of key climate-related risks has continued and increased, for instance, the potentially severe impacts for cultural heritage (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014c">IPCC, 2014c</a>; Pachauri et al., 2014; see also Section 16.4). These human dimensions are essential for understanding vulnerability, impacts and risks central to ensuring human well-being, human security, sustainable development and poverty reduction in a changing climate.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.1.1_p4">To encompass the nature of climate risk, IPCC assessment since the Third Assessment Report has used five overarching domains, named ‘reasons for concern’, to assess increasing risk for societies and ecosystems under climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014b">IPCC, 2014b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2017"></a><a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2017">O’Neill et al., 2017</a> ; see also Section 16.5; WGI Section 1.2.4.1).

The approach also respects the uncertainties inherent to climate risk and highlights the ways in which values are relevant in connecting scientific knowledge to societal decision making and risk management. The different reasons for concern underscore that there is no single metric that can reflect all dimensions of climate-related risk and the diversity of consequences for lives and livelihoods, health and well-being, economic and sociocultural assets, infrastructure and ecosystems (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2017">Mach and Field, 2017</a>; see also Section 1.4.1.2).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.1.1_p5">The AR6 Reasons for Concern framework enables integration across key risks and representative key risks, including how risks vary with the magnitude of global warming, socioeconomic development pathways and levels of adaptation (Section 16.6).

Many different overlapping and complementary terms and methods are used to evaluate and understand complex climate risk relevant to this report, such as aggregated, compounding or cascading risks, all of which are considered here as relevant to complex climate risk (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pescaroli--2018">Pescaroli and Alexander, 2018</a>; Simpson et. al. 2021).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.1.2_p2">The dynamic nature of risk and its determinants is one important dimension of complexity. The risk of climate change impacts can be usefully understood as resulting from dynamic interactions among climate-related hazards, the exposure and vulnerability of affected human and ecological systems, and also responses (see Section 1.2.1; AR6 Glossary, <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2021b">IPCC, 2021b</a>; WGI AR6 Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1, <a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2021">Chen et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2014">Oppenheimer et al., 2014</a>). The determinants of risk all can vary and change through space and time in response to socioeconomic development and decision making (Figures 1.4; 1.5; Section 16.1). Hazards are affected by current and future changes in climate, including altered climate variability and shifts in frequency and intensity of extreme events (WGI AR6 Chapter 12, <a class="reference-link" href="#Ranasinghe--2021">Ranasinghe et al., 2021</a>). Such hazards can be sudden, for example, a heat wave or heavy rain event, or slower onset, for example, land loss, degradation and erosion linked to multiple climate hazards compounding. The severity of climate change impacts will depend strongly on vulnerability, which is also dynamic and includes the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of affected human and ecological systems (McDowell et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jurgilevich--2017">Jurgilevich et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ford--2018">Ford et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Viner--2020">Viner et al., 2020</a>). As a result, risks vary at fine scale across communities and societies and also among people within societies, depending, for example, on intersecting inequalities and context-specific factors such as culture, gender, religion, ability and disability, or ethnicity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kuruppu--2009">Kuruppu, 2009</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2011">Jones and Boyd, 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Carr--2014">Carr and Thompson, 2014</a>; also Section 16.1.4). The dynamic social distribution of impacts is the subject of increasing attention within climate assessment and responses, including the role of adaptation, iterative risk management and climate resilient sustainable development (Section 16.1).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.1.2_p3">Another core area of complexity in climate risk is the behaviour of complex systems, which includes multiple stressors unfolding together, cascading or compounding interactions, and non-linear responses and the potential for surprises (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kopp--2017">Kopp et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Clarke--2018">Clarke et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yokohata--2019">Yokohata et al., 2019</a>). Risks and responses, including their determinants, can all interact dynamically in shaping the complexity of climate risk (Figure 1.4). The combined effects of multiple stressors or compound hazards and risks are unlikely to be assessed through simple addition of the independent effects and instead require system approaches to understanding risk. While some components may cancel each other out, others may nonlinearly increase risk. Nonlinearities can result from abrupt climate changes, tipping points or thresholds in responses, alternative stable states, low-probability/high-consequence outcomes or events that cannot be predicted based on current understanding (WGI Section 1.4.4.3).</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer027"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-6" id="figure-1-004" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_1_004.png"></span></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 1.4 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Increasingly complex climate-related risks. </span>Risk results from interactions among the determinants of risk—hazard, vulnerability, and exposure, shaped by responses—which can interact in complex ways.

(2021).</p></div><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.1.2_p5">The nature of climate risk also involves risks from responses themselves (Figure 1.5c). The risks of climate change responses include the possibility of responses not achieving their intended objectives or having trade-offs or adverse side effects for other societal objectives (Annex II: Glossary; Section 16.1). In particular, human responses may create novel hazards and unexpected side effects and entail opportunity costs and path dependencies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Boonstra--2016">Boonstra, 2016</a>). Such feedback loops can unfold at local and global scales, including large-scale interactions among climate, ecological and human systems with human behaviour and decision making affecting such interactions. Response risks can originate from uncertainty in implementation, maladaptation, action effectiveness, technology development or adoption, or transitions in systems (see Sections 1.4 and 1.5). Typical risks may be related to regulation, litigation, competition, sociopolitics or reputation. Interactions across responses can importantly involve co-benefits for other objectives, such as for human health and well-being which may be improved from both reduced air pollution (e.g., AR6 WGI Chapter 6, Szope et al., 2021; WGIII, IPCC, 2022) and enhanced adaptation to climate change. The nature of risk also entails residual impacts that will occur even with ambitious societal responses, given limits to adaptation at sectoral and regional levels (Section 1.4, 16.1, 16.4). In some cases, the losses will be irreversible.</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer030"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-7" id="figure-1-005a" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_1_005a.png"></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-8" id="figure-1-005b" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_1_005b.png"></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 1.5 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Risk in IPCC assessment through time. </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang> (a) </span> <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>An explicit risk framing emerged in the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) and WGII AR5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>, b). <span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang> (b) </span> <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>In the current assessment, the role of responses in modulating the determinants of risk is a new emphasis (the ‘wings’ of the hazard, vulnerability, and exposure ‘propellers’ represents the ways in which responses modulate each of these risk determinants). <span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang> (c) </span> <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB"></span>As the risk assessment spans Working Groups, the differential role of risk determinants for risk related to impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability versus risk related to mitigation becomes an increasingly important feature of climate risk assessment as well as management.</p></div><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.1.2_p7">Due to these complexities, the challenge of assessing risks of climate change is not well bounded, will be framed differently by individuals and groups, involves large and deep uncertainties, and will have unclear solutions and pathways to solutions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rittel--1973">Rittel and Webber, 1973</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Renn--2008">Renn, 2008</a>; see also Sections 1.5.2; 17.2.1).

The next step is to clearly define the indicators of the observed change or event and note the quality of the observations. There has been significant progress in the compilation of fragmented and distributed observational data, broadening and deepening the data basis for attribution research (<a class="reference-link" href="#Poloczanska--2013">Poloczanska et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ray--2015">Ray et al., 2015</a>; Cohen et al., 2018; WGI Section 1.5). The quality of the observational record of drivers should also be considered (e.g., volcanic eruptions: WGI Section 2.2.2). Impacted systems also change in the absence of climate change. This baseline and its associated modifiers such as agricultural developments or population growth need to be considered, alongside the exposure and vulnerability of people depending on these systems.</p><div class="Body_Box_blue_Box_Figure_title" lang="en-GB"><p lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-9" id="figure-1-cross-working-group-box-attribution-1" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_1_Cross-Working_Group_Box_ATTRIBUTION_1.png"></p><p><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure Cross-Working Group Box ATTRIBUTION.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Schematic of the steps to develop an attribution assessment, and the purposes of such assessments. </span>Methods and systems used to test the attribution hypothesis or theory include model-based fingerprinting, other model-based methods, evidence-based fingerprinting, process-based approaches, empirical or decomposition methods and the use of multiple lines of evidence.

In physical and biological systems, attribution often builds on the understanding of the mechanisms behind the observed changes and numerical models are used, while in human systems other methods of evidence-building are employed.

The most established method is to identify the ‘fingerprint’ of the expected space–time response to a particular climate forcing agent such as the concentration of anthropogenically induced GHGs or aerosols, or natural variation of solar radiation. This technique disentangles the contribution of individual forcing agents to an observed change (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Gillett--2021">Gillett et al., 2021</a>). New statistical approaches have been applied to better account for internal climate variability and the uncertainties in models and observations (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Naveau--2018">Naveau et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Santer--2019">Santer et al., 2019</a>; WGI Section 3.2). There are many other approaches, for example, global mean sea level change has been attributed to anthropogenic climate forcing by attributing the individual contributions from, for example, glacier melt or thermal expansion, while also examining which aspects of the observed change are inconsistent with internal variability (WGI Sections 3.5.2; 9.6.1.4).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Specific regional conditions and responses may simplify or complicate attribution on those scales. For example, some human forcings, such as regional land use change or aerosols, may enhance or reduce regional signals of change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lejeune--2018">Lejeune et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Undorf--2018">Undorf et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bo%C3%A9--2020">Boé et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Thiery--2020">Thiery et al., 2020</a>; see also WGI Sections 10.4.2; 11.1.6; 11.2.2). In general, regional climate variations are larger than the variations in global mean climate, adding additional uncertainty to attribution (e.g., in regional sea level change, WGI Section 9.6.1). These statistical limitations may be reduced by ‘process-based attribution’, focusing on the physical processes known to influence the response to external forcing and internal variability (WGI Section 10.4.2).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H1" lang="en-GB">Attribution of weather and climate events to anthropogenic forcing</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">New methods have emerged since AR5 to attribute the change in likelihood or characteristics of weather or climate events or classes of events to underlying drivers (<a class="reference-link" href="#National%20Academies%20of%20Sciences--2016">National Academies of Sciences, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Stott--2016">Stott et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#J%C3%A9z%C3%A9quel--2018">Jézéquel et al., 2018</a>; Wehner et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wang--2020">Wang et al., 2020</a>; WGI Sections 10.4.1; 11.2.2). Typically, historical changes, simulated under observed forcings, are compared to a counterfactual climate simulated in the absence of anthropogenic forcing. Another approach examines facets of the weather and thermodynamic status of an event through process-based attribution (<a class="reference-link" href="#hauser--2016">Hauser et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Shepherd--2018">Shepherd et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Grose--2020">Grose et al., 2020</a>; WGI Section 10.4.1; WGI Chapter 11).

The attribution of a change in a natural or human system (e.g., wild species, natural ecosystems, crop yields, economic development, infrastructure or human health) to changes in climate-related systems (i.e., climate and ocean acidification, permafrost thawing or sea level rise) requires accounting for other potential drivers of change, such as technological and economic changes in agriculture affecting crop production <a class="reference-link" href="#hochman--2017">Hochman et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#butler--2018">Butler et al., 2018</a>), changes in human population patterns and vulnerability affecting flood or wildfire induced damages (<a class="reference-link" href="#Huggel--2015">Huggel et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sauer--2021">Sauer et al., 2021</a>), or habitat loss driving declines in wild species (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPBES--2019b">IPBES, 2019b</a>). These drivers are accounted for by estimating a baseline condition that would exist in the absence of climate change. The baseline might be stationary and be approximated by observations from the past, or it may change over time and be simulated by statistical or process-based impact models (Section 16.2; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cramer--2014">Cramer et al., 2014</a>). Assessment of multiple independent lines of evidence, taken together, can provide rigorous attribution when more quantitative approaches are not available (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parmesan--2013">Parmesan et al., 2013</a>). These include palaeodata, physiological and ecological experiments, natural ‘experiments’ from very long-term datasets indicating consistent responses to the same climate trend/event and ‘fingerprints’ in species’ responses that are uniquely expected from climate change (e.g., poleward range boundaries expanding and equatorial range boundaries contracting in a coherent pattern worldwide, <a class="reference-link" href="#Parmesan--2003">Parmesan and Yohe, 2003</a>).

The literature is increasingly integrating and advancing long-standing scholarship on environmental and social governance, human dimensions of environmental change, risk perception and communication, and enabling conditions for effective policymaking. These emergent literatures on climate risk, human action and solution are reflected in three broad areas of analysis: (a) root drivers (i.e., role of cultural norms and social practice, social structures and economic development status that shape physical and social vulnerability; (b) context-specific barriers and enablers (i.e., governance structures, institutional structure and function, risk perceptions, access to financing and knowledge availability and needs) and (c) the solution-proximate decision space (i.e., climate urgency and catalysing conditions, risk communication strategies, M&amp;E strategies) (see <a class="reference-link" href="#Solecki--2017">Solecki et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jorgenson--2019">Jorgenson et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.2.2_p2">These three areas are deeply embedded in the social sciences and reflect fundamental questions of how and why humans and their institutions act and respond (Chapter 17). In the past two decades, these basic issues have been applied to research of climate change, dynamic risk and adaptation. Underlying this analysis, particularly of root drivers, barriers and enablers, are assertions regarding the foundational properties of individual and collective behaviour (i.e., self-interest, optimisation, rationality, bounded rationality), how they are structured and how these properties can be revealed. This literature draws on several academic disciplines, including anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psychology, sociology and urban studies. Climate change social science research is often interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary and hence utilises a variety of methods to derive new knowledge (<a class="reference-link" href="#Orlove--2020">Orlove et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.2.2_p3">In contrast to previous assessments, AR6 is increasingly focused on the needs for and challenges of assessing the societal response to climate change. The accurate tabulation of adaptation, a key question for examining the solution space, is difficult (Chapter 16; Cross-Chapter Box ADAPT in Chapter 1), since many forms of adaptation activity are under-represented in the peer-reviewed and grey literature. Moreover, the related question of assessing the effectiveness of adaptation, that is, the extent to which it reduces risk, is also difficult. Estimating risk reduction often involves counterfactuals, for instance, quantifying the damage a flood would have caused had a community not adapted prior to a storm or projecting the damage averted by today’s adaptation in some future storm (see Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in Chapter 17). Many socioeconomic drivers affect risk, so attribution for any observed or projected changes must be allocated among those that are due to adaptation and those due to economic development, cultural changes and other types of policies and trends. For instance, many measures of sustainable development overlap with those for adaptive capacity and both can reduce climate risk while also yielding benefits irrespective of future climate regimes (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2018">UNEP, 2018</a>). There are also many different goals for adaptation both among and within different jurisdictions, so that adaptation efforts deemed effective by some individuals may not be deemed effective by others (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dilling--2019">Dilling et al., 2019</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="1.3.2.3"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">1.3.2.3 Indigenous Knowledge and Local Knowledge <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-9-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.2.3_p1">While scientific knowledge is vital, IK and LK are also necessary for understanding and acting effectively on climate risk (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>, SROCC Chapter 1; see also Section 2.4). <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Indigenous knowledge</span> refers to the understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with long histories of interaction with their natural surroundings (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019a">IPCC, 2019a</a>). <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Local knowledge</span> is defined as the understandings and skills developed by individuals and populations, specific to the places where they live (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019a">IPCC, 2019a</a>).

However, there is agreement that, in the same way that there is not a unique definition of Indigenous Peoples because it depends on self-determination (see below), there is not a single definition of neither IK and LK.

Knowledge may be place based and rooted in local cultures, especially when it reflects the beliefs of long-settled communities who have strong ties to their natural environments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Orlove--2010">Orlove et al., 2010</a>). Other times, knowledge may be embedded in institutions or oral traditions that mobilise them across contexts, for example, as migrant populations bring their knowledge across different regions, and have global relevance. Scientific insights often confirm IK and LK (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ignatowski--2013">Ignatowski and Rosales, 2013</a>), but IK and LK also provides specific, alternative ways to understand environmental change. This includes tacit and embodied aspects of knowledge (<a class="reference-link" href="#Melleg%C3%A5rd--2020">Mellegård and Boonstra, 2020</a>) that may be crucial to foster local action and that are not easily captured in scientific knowledge (including cultural indicators, scales and interconnectedness between ecosystems). Multiple knowledge systems (i.e. IK, LK, disciplinary knowledge, technical expertise) may coevolve in iterative and interactive processes whereby they influence each other. However, at the same time, they may have specific characteristics so that they cannot be reduced to each other or subsumed by each other, and they all have relevance to understanding the interactions between society and climate (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bremer--2019">Bremer et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.2.3_p3">Moreover, IK and LK may be particularly relevant to ensuring that climate action does not cause further harm, and also addresses historical injustices committed against Indigenous Peoples and other marginalised social groups, recognising them as active agents of their own change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nursey-Bray--2019">Nursey-Bray et al., 2019</a>). There are between 370 and 500 million people in at least 90 countries belonging to about 5,000 different ethnic groups that are classified as ‘Indigenous’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sangha--2019">Sangha et al., 2019</a>). Although there is no single, universal definition of Indigenous Peoples, core criterion within both the ILO Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples (1989) and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN--2007">UN, 2007</a>) include: (a) self-determination and (b) the recognition that Indigenous Peoples as distinct social and cultural groups that retain collective ancestral ties to the lands they inhabited or to the lands from which they have been displaced. Indigenous Peoples attribute cultural and spiritual values to land, environmental features and landscapes (<a class="reference-link" href="#ILO--2013">ILO, 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#ILO--2019">ILO, 2019</a>). Indigenous Peoples suffer disproportionally. For example, they are three times more likely to live in extreme poverty than non-Indigenous Peoples; they are also more likely to suffer discrimination and violence (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN--2020">UN, 2020</a>). At the same time, Indigenous Peoples have long led climate change and environmental protection agendas.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.2.3_p4">Indigenous Peoples have been faced with adaptation challenges for centuries and have developed coping strategies in changing environments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Coates--2004">Coates, 2004</a>). Along with other local groups, they hold relevant knowledge about the environment and environmental change, the impact of those changes on ecosystems and livelihoods, and possible effective adaptive responses (see Cross-Chapter Box INDIG in Chapter 18). Therefore, the participation of Indigenous Peoples in climate change decisions and the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge in the IPCC assessment process should be of high priority (following recommendations in <a class="reference-link" href="#UNESCO--2018b">UNESCO, 2018b</a>, and <a class="reference-link" href="#UN--2020">UN, 2020</a>). Furthermore, the participation of scientifically trained climate specialists with indigenous backgrounds is valuable to the work of IPCC because the assessment must reflect a diverse range of views and expertise (for examples of IK, see Cross-Chapter Box INDIG in Chapter 18). Article 31 of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007) supports the inclusion of IK and LK in the IPCC assessment process, calling for the use of IK and LK to be protected and validated by Indigenous Peoples themselves and their inclusion as active participants in the assessment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Klenk--2017">Klenk et al., 2017</a>). Paying special attention to the mechanism whereby some forms of knowledge have been excluded in previous reports—such as the use of technical knowledge or acronyms, or the deployment of discipline-specific validation mechanism—is a first step towards developing an inclusive assessment that reflects a wide range of voices.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.2.3_p5">The AR4 was the first IPCC report to explicitly discuss the value of IK and LK in adaptation and mitigation processes. AR5 recognised the importance of creating synergies across disciplines in the production of knowledge, acknowledging the importance of ‘non-scientific’ sources such as IK, which may not follow discipline conventions but nevertheless reflects the outcomes of learning across generations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Burkett--2014">Burkett et al., 2014</a>). This also explains the importance of including IK and LK and diverse stakeholder interests and values in local decision making processes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2014">Jones et al., 2014</a>). Such processes should be done in partnership with IK and LK knowledge holders and, when possible, be led by them (<a class="reference-link" href="#Inuit%20Tapiriit%20Kanatami--2018">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, 2018</a>). Recent IPCC reports have included distinct sections dedicated to IK and LK (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019b">IPCC, 2019b</a>). The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) includes a section on ‘Local and Indigenous knowledge for addressing land degradation’ (2019a) and the IPCC Special Report on Ocean and Cryosphere (SROCC) describes LK as ‘what non-Indigenous communities, both rural and urban, use on a daily and lifelong basis,’ a type of knowledge which is recognised as ‘multi-generational, embedded in community practices and cultures, and adaptive to changing conditions’ (2019b). The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C emphasised the high vulnerability of Indigenous Peoples to climate change. It stated that disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, including Indigenous Peoples and certain local communities, are at disproportionately higher risk of suffering adverse consequences with global warming of 1.5°C and beyond (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018b">IPCC, 2018b</a>). The report also assessed evidence in relation to the importance of including IK and LK in adaptation options, explaining their role in early warning systems and arguing that they are part of a range of approaches to catalyse wide-scale values and are consistent with adapting to and limiting global warming to 1.5°C (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018b">IPCC, 2018b</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.2.3_p6">Since AR5, several academic publications have directly addressed the challenges of including IK and LK in climate research ( <a class="reference-link" href="#Ford--2016">Ford et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yeh--2016">Yeh, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#David-Chavez--2018">David-Chavez and Gavin, 2018</a>) and demonstrated its value in building resilience to extreme events related to climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Janif--2016">Janif et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Olazabal--2021">Olazabal et al., 2021</a>). For instance, IK and LK has proved useful in land management methods that reduce wildfire risk (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nepstad--2006">Nepstad et al., 2006</a>; Cook et al., 2012; <a class="reference-link" href="#Welch--2013">Welch et al., 2013</a>; Mistry et al., 2016). Since IK is traditionally communicated through storytelling and oral history, there are practical challenges to integrating it into an assessment that prioritises scientific knowledge. There is a need for increased critical engagement towards the co-production of knowledge (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ford--2016">Ford et al., 2016</a>). Scholars now recognise the ontological and epistemological differences in approaches, understandings and effects of climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Yeh--2016">Yeh, 2016</a>). One common strategy has been assessing Indigenous observations of climate change alongside scientific data (<a class="reference-link" href="#Klein--2014a">Klein et al., 2014a</a>) as a means to bridge the gap between scientific inquiry and Indigenous knowledge systems (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fern%C3%A1ndez-Llamazares--2017">Fernández-Llamazares et al., 2017</a>). The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the CBD have helped illustrate how to bridge multiple knowledge systems, particularly those conceived from different ontologies. Rather than viewing IK as a single source of knowledge to be compared with scientific data, recent scholarship suggests assessments, such as the IPCC, directly involve Indigenous researchers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Yumagulova--2019">Yumagulova et al., 2019</a>) to ensure ethical and equitable engagement with IK. Such partnership with and leadership of Indigenous Peoples on climate research is also consistent with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Bawaka%20Country--2015">Bawaka Country et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Inuit%20Tapiriit%20Kanatami--2018">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, 2018</a>; Cross-Chapter Box INDIG in Chapter 18).</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="cross-chapter-box-paleo"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Cross-Chapter Box PALEO | Vulnerability and Adaptation to Past Climate Changes</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-21-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Authors: Wolfgang Kiessling (Germany, Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Paper 1), Timothy A.

Climate responses of natural and human systems are intertwined through the physiological limits of wild animals, livestock, plants and humans, subject to a slow evolutionary dynamic (<a class="reference-link" href="#Poertner--2021">Pörtner, 2021</a>; Sections 2.6.1; 3.3).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H1" lang="en-GB">Climate has always changed, often with severe effects on nature, including species loss</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Observations provided by the historical, archaeological, and palaeontological records, together with paleoclimatic data, demonstrate that climatic variability has high potential to affect biodiversity and human society (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). The evolution of the Earth’s biota has been punctuated by global biodiversity crises often triggered by rapid warming (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Figure PALEO.1; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bond--2017">Bond and Grasby, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Benton--2018">Benton, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Foster--2018">Foster et al., 2018</a>;). These so-called hyperthermal events were marked by rapid warming of &gt;1°C, which coincided with global disturbances of the carbon and water cycles, and by reduced oxygen and pH in seawater ( <a class="reference-link" href="#Foster--2018">Foster et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Clapham--2019">Clapham and Renne, 2019</a>). Magnitudes of global temperature shifts in hyperthermal events were sometimes greater than those predicted for the current century but extended over longer periods of time. Rates inferred from paleo records that are coarsely resolved are inevitably lower than those from direct observations during recent decades, and caution must be exercised when describing the rate of recent temperature changes as unprecedented (Kemp et al., 2015). Mass extinctions, each with greater than 70% marine species extinctions, occurred when the magnitude of temperature change exceeded 5.2°C (<a class="reference-link" href="#Song--2021">Song et al., 2021</a>), albeit species extinctions occurred at lower magnitudes of warming (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H1" lang="en-GB">Adaptation options to rapid climate change are limited</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Responses of biota to rapid climate change have included range shifts (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>very high confidence</span>), phenotypic plasticity (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>), evolutionary adaptation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>), and species extinctions, including mass extinctions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>very high confidence</span>).

For example, <a class="section-link" data-title="Changing State of the Climate System" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2">Chapter 2</a> introduces regions in its discussion of biomes, as in arid, grassland, savanna, tundra, tropical, temperate and boreal forested regions. <a class="section-link" data-title="Human Influence on the Climate System" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-3">Chapter 3</a> adds reference to an area’s orientation with bodies of water, using terms such as deltaic, coastal, intercoastal, freshwater and salty. In addition, Cross-Chapter Paper 2 uses a coastal region typology based on physical geomorphology considering elevation, coastal type and topography (see Cross-Chapter Paper 2, p. 5; <a class="reference-link" href="#Barrag%C3%A1n--2015">Barragán and de Andrés, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kay--2017">Kay and and Adler, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Haasnoot--2019a">Haasnoot et al., 2019a</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.3_p4">Third, CCPs are dedicated to <span class="condensed_italic" lang>typological regions</span>, defined in the Annex II: Glossary as regions that share one or more specific features (known as ‘typologies’), such as geographic location (e.g., <span class="condensed_italic" lang>coastal</span>), physical processes (e.g., <span class="condensed_italic" lang>monsoons</span>), biological (e.g., coral reefs, tropical forests, deserts), geological (e.g., mountains) or <span class="condensed_italic" lang>anthropogenic</span> (e.g., megacities), and for which it is useful to consider the common climate features.

The goal of such methods has been consistent treatment of uncertainties in assessing and communicating the current state of knowledge. Because terms such as ‘probable’ or ‘likely ’ hold very different meanings to different people, a standardised approach is essential for enabling consistent interpretation (WGI Section 1.2.3.1). Since its 2001 assessment, IPCC authors have applied common guidance on expert judgement across the Working Groups (<a class="reference-link" href="#Moss--2000">Moss and Schneider, 2000</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2005">IPCC, 2005</a>). The AR5, iteratively building from past IPCC guidance, was the first report to apply a single framework consistently across the Working Groups and their diverse topics and associated disciplines (Figure 1.3; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mastrandrea--2010">Mastrandrea et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mastrandrea--2011">Mastrandrea and Mach, 2011</a>).

Under the framework, the assessment of scientific understanding and uncertainties begins with evaluation of <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">evidence</span> and <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">agreement </span>—especially the type, amount, quality and consistency of evidence and the degree of agreement (steps 1–3 in Figure 1.6). Evidence assessed can reflect observations, experimental results, process-based understanding, statistical analyses or model outputs. Evidence is most robust when it consists of multiple lines of consistent, independent and high-quality evidence. The degree of agreement considers the extent of established, competing or speculative explanations for a given topic or phenomenon across the scientific community. Together, this evaluation of evidence and agreement forms a traceable account for each key finding in the assessment. Subsequently, the framework proceeds to evaluation of levels of <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">confidence</span>, which integrate evidence and agreement (steps 3–5 in Figure 1.6). Confidence reflects qualitative judgements of the validity of findings. It thereby facilitates, more readily, comparisons across assessment conclusions.

The relevant probabilities can pertain to single events or broader outcomes. Probabilistic judgements can be based on statistical or modelling analyses, elicitation of expert views or other quantitative analyses. Where appropriate, authors can present probability more precisely with complete probability distributions or percentile ranges, also considering tails of distributions important for risk management. Usually, likelihood assignments are underpinned by high or very high confidence in the findings.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.4_p5">Confidence is often most applicable in characterising key findings in WGII assessment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2017">Mach et al., 2017</a>). This tendency results from the diverse lines of evidence across disciplines relevant to climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. By contrast, likelihood is more common in WGI assessment.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.3.4_p6">The guidance to authors additionally identifies other practices and approaches relevant in applying expert judgement and developing assessment findings (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mastrandrea--2010">Mastrandrea et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mastrandrea--2011">Mastrandrea and Mach, 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mach--2017">Mach and Field, 2017</a>). First, authors are encouraged to carefully consider appropriate generalisation within assessment findings, emphasising insights that are integrative, nuanced and rigorous (<a class="reference-link" href="#IAC--2010">IAC, 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mastrandrea--2010">Mastrandrea et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#NEAA--2010">NEAA, 2010</a>). Second, authors are instructed to attend to potential biases, including in group dynamics, such as tendencies towards overconfidence and anchoring or Type I (false positive) error aversion (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mastrandrea--2010">Mastrandrea et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Brysse--2013">Brysse et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Anderegg--2014">Anderegg et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Morgan--2014">Morgan, 2014</a>). Third, particular attention is drawn to the importance of evaluating and communicating ranges of potential outcomes to inform decision making and risk management (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mastrandrea--2010">Mastrandrea et al., 2010</a>). In some cases, deep uncertainties related to parameters or processes that are unknown or disagreed upon strongly benefit from dedicated methods of assessment and decision support (see Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17). Fourth, the guidance explores the different ways that framings of conclusions can shape their interpretation by readers. Finally, the guidance underscores the importance of reflecting upon all sources of uncertainty, which can include deep, difficult-to-quantify and easy-to-underestimate uncertainties arising from incomplete understanding of relevant processes or competing conceptualisations across the literature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mastrandrea--2010">Mastrandrea et al., 2010</a>).

This section introduces key concepts used in this report to assess the goals associated with adaptation, its process and governance, its implementation, M&amp;E and its limits.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4_p2">The term ‘solutions’ has various synonyms used across this and previous IPCC reports, including options, measures, actions and responses. All denote policies, technologies, processes, investments or other activities undertaken in reaction to or with the intent of addressing some aspect of climate change (Chapter 17). The term ‘solutions’ has drawbacks, suggesting a finality, that is, the problem is solved. Solving climate change in this sense is not likely for the foreseeable future. In addition, the word ‘solutions’ sometimes denotes a narrow set of responses, such as ‘technical solution’, as opposed to more wide-ranging actions that might be involved in a transition to resilience. Nonetheless, AR6 highlights the term ‘solutions’ because, compared to these other terms, when acted upon or incorporated in policy, it denotes effectiveness and some degree of progress at achieving desired goals.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4_p3">Assessing successful adaptation is, however, difficult (Cross-Chapter Box ADAPT in Chapter 1). WGIII Section 1.6 summarises four broad analytic frameworks—aggregate efficiency, ethics and equity, transition dynamics, and psychology and politics—relevant to mitigation and concludes that failure to integrate understanding across them has been a fundamental reason for inadequate progress to date in reducing GHG emissions. While the four analytic frameworks used in WGIII also all contribute to the understanding of adaptation, an integrated view remains elusive because adaptation differs strongly from mitigation. In particular, the goals of adaptation are harder to define and measure than those for mitigation. The feasibility, effectiveness and success of many adaptation actions depend more strongly on context. A different, often more diffuse, set of actors are involved, and it is often hard to distinguish what activities count as adaptation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4_p4">Given these challenges, this report provides an assessment of adaptation solutions based on the attributes <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">justice</span>, <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">feasibility</span> and <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">effectiveness</span>, as shown in Figure 1.7.</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer046"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-13" id="figure-1-007" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_1_007.png"></span></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 1.7 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang></span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Assessing adaptation solutions and success</span></span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>. </span>A solution is defined as an adaptation option which is effective, feasible and conforms to principles of justice. These attributes can be assessed <span class="light_condensed_italic" lang>ex ante</span> during adaptation planning. During implementation, the overall success of a response can be judged via monitoring and evaluation of these attributes. Adaptation unfolds as an iterative learning process of assessment, implementation, monitoring, adjustment and learning. A set of responses is adequate to the extent that they sufficiently reduce climate risk to levels considered tolerable. Adaptation may not fully avoid residual risks, but the more adequate the response, the less residual risk remains. Adaptation also has limits beyond which it is no longer possible to avoid intolerable risks and impacts.</p></div><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4_p6">A solution is just when its outcomes, the process of implementing the action and the process of choosing the action respects principles of distributive, procedural and recognitional <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">justice</span> (Section 1.4.1.1). Any assessment of justice depends on an understanding of potential outcomes of alternative options (Chapter 16), as well as processes of decision making (Chapter 17). Consideration of justice necessarily introduces normative elements into any assessment of what constitutes a solution.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4_p7">A solution is <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">effective</span> to the extent it reduces climate risk. Effectiveness can refer to whether an adaptation-related action reduces risk (Section 1.4.1.2; Chapter 16) or the extent to which an action achieves its intended outcomes within a stated time frame (Chapter 17). Effectiveness can also include measures of economic efficiency, assessment of net benefits over costs and the extent to which an action enhances broader and multi-dimensional measures of societal well-being (Section 1.4.1.2). Assessments of effectiveness will often involve uncertainty, which may affect judgements about the comparative effectiveness and justice of alternative options (Chapters 16; 17; Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17). Assessment of effectiveness also involves consideration of maladaptation (Section 1.4.2.4) in which an action, often inadvertently, increases risk or vulnerability for some or all affected individuals or communities.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4_p8">A solution is <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">feasible</span> to the extent it is considered possible and desirable, taking into consideration barriers, enablers, synergies and trade-offs (Section 1.4.2). AR6 assesses the feasibility of a wide range of adaptation options (Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18), building on the approach of the SR1.5 report, which uses five dimensions of feasibility: geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic, sociocultural, institutional. In addition, feasibility can also refer to a specific set of actions, so that feasibility in any particular situation may depend on specific conditions of governance capacity, financial capacity, public opinion, interest group pressure, and the distribution of political and economic power (Chapter 17). For instance, a particular jurisdiction may find either of two options feasible when implemented alone but might lack the capacity to implement them both at the same time. Feasibility can be a context-dependent and time-varying attribute. Many solutions, for instance those that seek to unlock financing or build public support for certain actions, aim at increasing the feasibility of future adaptation responses (Sections 1.4.2; 1.5).</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="1.4.1"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">1.4.1 What is Equitable, Just and Effective Adaptation?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-11-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.1_p1">Articulating the goals of adaptation is an important initial step in the decision-making process (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2014">Jones et al 2014</a>).

The term ‘climate justice,’ however, has been used in different ways in different contexts and by different communities. Grassroot organisations and activists often focus on unequal global power relations, wealth, and interests within communities, within nations, and along the North–South divide, as well as the historical responsibility for climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chatterton--2013">Chatterton et al., 2013</a>). Some national governments also view climate justice as the right of developing countries to industrialise. Balancing these issues, international climate change negotiations have primarily focused on current capacities and responsibilities for addressing climate change as reflected in the UNFCCC principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fisher--2015">Fisher, 2015</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.1.1_p2">Since principles of justice are substantive normative commitments that have been debated for centuries, it would be unrealistic to expect a universal consensus.

The first refers to the distribution of burdens and benefits; the second to who decides and participates in decision making; while recognition entails basic respect and robust engagement with and fair consideration of diverse values, cultures, perspectives, and worldviews. Recognition is closely linked to distributive and procedural justice (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hourdequin--2016">Hourdequin, 2016</a>). Without recognition, actors may not benefit from the two other aspects of justice (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>). Recognition thus represents both a normative principle as well as an underlying cause of unjust distribution and lack of democratic participation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Svarstad--2020">Svarstad and Benjaminsen, 2020</a>). However, recognition is still under-represented in climate justice compared to general scholarship and debate on justice principles (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chu--2018">Chu and Michael, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Benjaminsen--2021">Benjaminsen et al., 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.1.1_p4">Three principles of distributive justice are especially relevant to adaptation: <span class="condensed_italic" lang>fairness between individuals</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>fairness between states</span> and <span class="condensed_italic" lang>fairness between generations</span> (Fleurbaey et al., 2014<span class="condensed_italic" lang>)</span>. Fairness between individuals means that the distribution of goods, vulnerabilities and risks of climate change should not fall on individuals for arbitrary reasons. It would be arbitrary if, say, a family were disproportionately affected by climate-induced drought by chance alone. Similarly, an adaptation action that protects some and creates risks for others is unfair if the final distribution of burdens and benefits is arbitrary.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.1.1_p5">The second consideration of distributive justice is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>international justice</span>, or fairness between states.

Developed countries may find themselves in a position where they can decarbonise more rapidly and ensure financial flows, while the responsibilities of LDCs and SIDS may primarily come in the form of adaptation actions. This means that uneven distribution of wealth and power between (and within) countries is a key driver of climate injustice.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.1.1_p6">The third consideration of distributive justice relevant to climate adaptation is fairness between generations and the obligation to ensure that future generations are guaranteed at least a minimally decent life (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jonas--1985">Jonas, 1985</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="Llavador--2010">Llavador et al., 2010</a>).

Criteria include transparency, the application of neutral principles among parties, respect for participants’ rights and inclusive participation in decision making, which often takes the form of participatory processes. Article 6 of the Framework Convention creates a binding commitment on parties to promote public participation in addressing climate change. Increased participation by civil society in climate policy discussion, including new forums such as the Local Communities and Indigenous People’s Platform of the UNFCCC work toward this goal (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNFCCC--2021">UNFCCC, 2021</a>). Genuine, not merely formal, participation requires communities be well-acquainted with the climate change risks they face and are given a full voice in the process of adaptation planning. Many local communities, especially those most vulnerable to climate change, remain excluded, which is inconsistent with principles of procedural justice.

This report uses both single and multi-criteria measures. Local and regional decision makers employ benefit–cost analysis to efficiently allocate scarce resources among alternative adaptation efforts and among adaptation and other societal needs. Decision makers at national and global levels can employ measures of social welfare to consider trade-offs and synergies among adaptation, mitigation, and development. Such measures can avoid wasteful allocation of resources and help avoid maladaptation. Such measures also prove useful because well-established approaches exist to evaluate such quantities, and because income is highly correlated with a wide range of indicators of social progress and climate change adaptation capacity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dasgupta--2018">Dasgupta et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.1.2_p2">Aggregate, monetised economic measures are, however, insufficient to address issues of climate justice fully or to reflect that wide range of worldviews and values that different people bring to questions of climate action and development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chambwera--2014">Chambwera et al., 2014</a>). While recent work has enriched the consideration of distributive justice in aggregate social welfare functions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adler--2012">Adler, 2012</a>), multi-objective approaches that separately report several biophysical and socioeconomic attributes can prove valuable (Section 17.3.3). Many adaptation measures, in particular those that encompass transformational social changes (Section 1.5), involve complicated trade-offs among multi-dimensional benefits and costs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Adger--2016">Adger, 2016</a>). Different people commonly value such trade-offs differently, particularly in heterogeneous societies. Multi-objective measures can thus enhance transparency, fairness, legitimacy and participation by highlighting the different outcomes that different people and communities might find important, making the specific trade-offs more transparent and explicit, and avoiding privileging any particular view on the appropriate trade-offs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lempert--2018">Lempert et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Siders--2019b">Siders, 2019b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Siders--2020">Siders and Keenan, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.1.2_p3">The SDGs and Key Representative Risks (Chapter 16) exemplify such multi-criteria measures.

Rather than focus on the economic value of lost assets, the well-being measure evaluates disaster impacts and recovery policies by considering the fraction of consumption lost at the household level for different income cohorts. Not surprisingly, poor households account for twice as much of the disaster losses when evaluated by effects on well-being rather than by asset losses. The most effective policy responses also differ when using well-being and asset loss-based measures. Ciullo et. al. (2020) compare flood control strategies using multi-objective decision criteria that include both benefit–cost and distributional components, show how the favoured strategy can depend on whether one seeks equitable risk or equitable risk reduction, and propose tools that can help embed both ethical and efficiency considerations in adaptation decisions.

Actions previously taken can reduce the scale of responses needed subsequently, increase the options available, reduce barriers to additional action and increase capacity to respond. Successful adaptation sufficient to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and SDGs needs to involve actors at many scales and in many sectors, including individuals and households, communities, governments at all levels, private sector businesses, non-governmental organisations, religious groups and social movements. This report highlights the increased range of societal actors engaged in adaptation and the need for multi-level and polycentric governance. The section describes key concepts related to the process of adaptation and assessment of how human choices and exogenous changes can expand and contract the set of available solutions.</p><div class="h3-container" id="1.4.2.1"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">1.4.2.1 Adaptation Process and Expanding the Solution Space <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-12-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.2.1_p1">Adaptation actions include those taken with the explicit intention of reducing climate risk, as well as actions taken without reference to climate change, for example, building community resilience irrespective of any particular hazard. Adaptation actions can include those aimed at reducing a specific risk or actions aimed at systemic changes, and also include adjustments to current practices or transformational changes. In addition, the success of adaptation in one place or jurisdiction can depend on activities in other places or jurisdictions.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.2.1_p2">Adaptation actions span a vast range of activities. Successful adaptation generally requires a portfolio of actions, often implemented by multiple actors in different sectors, often in different places and over time (Section 17.2.2). Useful taxonomies include categorising such actions around representative key risks (Figure 17.3), and by human systems and scenarios of adaptation extent for four components of adaptation (depth, scope, speed and limits) (Table 16.2). As shown in Chapter 17, for instance, ecosystem-based adaptation, hardening buildings and physical barriers, and changes to zoning and planned retreat can reduce risks to coastal socio-ecological systems. Restoration and protection of forests, enhancing ecosystem connectivity through corridors and ecosystem-based adaptation can reduce risks to terrestrial and ocean ecosystems. Increased use of grey, green and blue infrastructure and upgrading design standards, city plans and more redundancy in power systems and other networks can reduce risks associated with critical infrastructure. Insurance and diversified or changed livelihoods can reduce risks to living standards and equity. Improved health-care systems, disaster management and early warning can reduce risks to human health. Better management of land, soil and fisheries, and changing diets and reducing food waste can reduce risks to food security. Improved water efficiency and policies to reduce demand can reduce risks to water security.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.2.1_p3">Previous IPCC reports have described in detail adaptation for individual actors as an iterative risk management process of scoping (identifying risks, vulnerabilities, objectives and decision-making criteria), analysis (identifying options, assessing risks, evaluating trade-offs) and implementation (implementing chosen options, monitoring, and reviewing and learning) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2014">Jones et. al. 2014</a>). This AR6 report expands the focus to consider adaptation processes with multiple actors and a richer temporal dimension in which actions taken at one time can expand or contract the set of feasible, effective and just options available at another time, thereby increasing or decreasing the ability of adaptation to reduce risks (Section 17.1). This AR6 report also expands the focus to include decision processes the implement both adaptation and mitigation (Chapter 18), as well as heightened attention to M&amp;E, which is a key prerequisite for successful iterative risk management and achieving effective and just adaptation outcomes at local to global levels (Sections 1.4.3; 17.5.2). The challenges of implications for adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development outcomes result from decision-making process at different levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Von-Stechow--2015">Von Stechow et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bertram--2016">Bertram et al., 2016</a>).

Enabling conditions enhance the feasibility of adaptation and mitigation options (AR6 Glossary, <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2021b">IPCC, 2021b</a>). Enablers include finance, technological innovation, strengthening policy instruments, institutional capacity, multi-level governance and changes in human behaviour and lifestyles. Chapter 17 (see also WGIII Figure 1.4) identifies three broad categories of enabling conditions: (Section 17.4): governance, finance and knowledge. Catalysing conditions motivate and accelerate the adaptation decision-making process, leading to more frequent and more substantial adaptation (Chapter 17). While enablers make adaptation more feasible and effective, catalysing conditions provide an impetus for action. These later conditions include a sense of urgency (Section 17.4.5.1), system shocks, such as those from natural disasters, policy entrepreneurs and social movements.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.2.1_p5">The concept of the <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">solution space</span> provides a framework for assessing how the options available for adaptation for any particular community are not constant over time and can depend on the past, current and future choices of many actors. The solution space is defined as the space within which opportunities and constraints determine why, how, when and who adapts to climate risks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Haasnoot--2020">Haasnoot et al., 2020</a>). The concept aims to capture the dynamic inter-temporal, spatial and jurisdictional interconnections among adaptation actions. A larger solution space indicates people and organisations with more options for adapting to and reducing their risk from climate change. Both human choices and exogenous changes in human and natural systems affect the future solution space. For instance, changes such as the magnitude and rate of climate change may shrink the space. Economic growth can generate more resources that expand the solution space as can implemented adaptation actions such as pilot projects, awareness raising and changes in laws and regulations.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.2.1_p6">AR5 used the concept of solution space in its SPM Figure 8 (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014c">IPCC, 2014c</a>). Several AR6 chapters, in particular Chapters 13, 14 and 18, use the concept to address challenges salient in AR6. In any assessment of solutions, what is feasible, effective and just depends not only on the potential solution itself but the particular biophysical and societal context in which it might occur (Section 17.5; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wise--2014">Wise et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gorddard--2016">Gorddard et al., 2016</a>). Solutions can also be space and time dependent because the biophysical and societal context can change over space and time (Section 18.1.4). In addition, the large gap that exists between current climate action and that needed to meet policy goals suggests that decision makers may not only seek to implement available solutions but seek to actively expand the set of solutions (Chapters 17; 18). Finally, as used in this report, the concept of solution does not fully engage with questions of ‘by whom?’ and ‘for whom?’ In many cases solutions would necessarily be implemented by multiple, independent actors interacting with varying degrees of cooperation and competition (Sections 1.5.2).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="1.4.2.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">1.4.2.2 Governing Adaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-13-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.2.2_p1">Governance and governing refer to the structures, processes and actions through which private and public actors interact to address societal goals. This includes formal and informal institutions and the associated norms, rules, laws and procedures for deciding, managing, implementing and monitoring policies and measures at any geographic or political scale, from global to local. Governance systems and the specific societal institutions through which they are organised are crucial to the feasibility and success of climate change adaptation, both in terms of its effectiveness in reducing climate risk and vulnerability, as well as equity (including climate justice), with respect to incremental as well as transformational adaptation. This is why AR6 WGII pays even more attention than previous assessments to governance as an important enabling condition, and to the wide range of new actors beyond governments involved in planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating adaptation action. The assessments in subsequent chapters of AR6 WGII show that successful and equitable collective adaptation efforts at different levels and scales, based on key principles of iterative risk management, require strong, usually multi-level. governance systems. Multi-level governance refers to the dispersion of governance across multiple levels of jurisdiction and decision making, including global, regional, national and local, as well as trans-regional and trans-national levels (see also WG III Chapter 1). The concept emphasises that modern governance generally consists of, and is more flexible, when there are linkages of governance processes across different scales and levels. Multi-level governance is widely regarded as crucial, particularly for transformational adaptation, defined as ‘adapting to climate change resulting in significant changes in structure or function that go beyond adjusting existing practices including approaches that enable new ways of decision making on adaptation’ (IPCC SR1.5, <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018b">IPCC, 2018b</a>; see also Section 1.5). The assessment in subsequent chapters also shows that public governance arrangements and institutions support most adaptation for addressing the main climate risks, though the importance of the private sector and community organisations in adaptation is increasing. It also shows that polycentric governance tends to benefit adaptation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.2.2_p2">The empirical literature on adaptation governance has advanced strongly since AR5. It shows that stronger general governance capabilities are usually associated with more ambitious adaptation plans and more effective implementation of such plans (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2014">UNEP, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2016">Chen et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Keskitalo--2019b">Keskitalo and Preston, 2019b</a>: 24; <a class="reference-link" href="#ND-GAIN--2019">ND-GAIN, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Oberlack--2017">Oberlack, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Oberlack--2018">Oberlack and Eisenack, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Woodruff--2019">Woodruff and Regan, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2018">UNEP, 2018</a>; UNEP et al., 2021). Governance capabilities are, to a significant degree, but not exclusively, a function of available financial resources and technology. They are also a function of social capital and societal institutions, including well-functioning local, regional and national governments, and collaboration among these governmental actors and non-governmental stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector. The literature also points to governance conditions that are likely to enable transformational adaptation (Maor et al., 2017; see also Sections 1.4.4; 1.5; Chapter 17).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.2.2_p3">Existing comparative data for adaptive capacity worldwide is at a rather coarse level of temporal and spatial resolution. It can, nonetheless, provide a very general picture of rates of change in adaptive capacity at the national scale, and differences between countries. Further empirical research is needed to identify the most important predictors of variation across countries and time, though the available data suggests that differing national income and education levels play a major role in accounting for differences in adaptive capacity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Andrijevic--2020">Andrijevic et al., 2020</a>). Spatially more resolved (sub-national) data is needed because a large body of case study research suggests that there is strong variation within countries, particularly the large ones (e.g., India, China, Brazil, United States) (Chapter 16; see also <a class="reference-link" href="#Nalau--2021">Nalau and Verrall, 2021</a> and Cross-Chapter Box ADAPT). Moreover, higher degrees of adaptive capacity do not mean that adaptation action will follow automatically, nor that it will succeed in terms of equity and effectiveness in reducing vulnerability to climate change and enhancing well-being. How differences across and within countries in climate risk exposure translate into adaptation action, contingent on differences in adaptive capacity, can to some extent be inferred from case studies, but this remains to be studied at a larger, comparable and generalisable scale.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.2.2_p4">Governance capacity constitutes an important enabling condition not only because it facilitates the (efficient) organisation and implementation of adaptation action, but also because it contributes to learning. The latter is central to the process of adaptation as information regarding current and future climate conditions continues to evolve, as does understanding of appropriate response options and the actors involved. In addition, norms, values and practices may change in response to changing conditions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2014">Jones et al., 2014</a>). Much learning by individuals, communities and organisations is unplanned (<a class="reference-link" href="#National%20Research%20Council--2009">National Research Council, 2009</a>), as is much current adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Berrang-Ford--2020">Berrang-Ford, 2020</a>), which can reduce near-term costs and administrative complexity, but may prove maladaptive (Section 1.4.2.4). Iterative risk management (Section 1.2.1.1) and related concepts such as risk governance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Renn--2008">Renn, 2008</a>) describe a planned learning process of ongoing assessment, action and reassessment. Iterative risk management can be as simple as scheduling future updates of assessments and plans, as with the 5-year updates of the global stocktake after 2023 called for in the Paris Agreement, or encompass more elaborate learning processes, such as dynamic adaptive pathways (<a class="reference-link" href="#Haasnoot--2019b">Haasnoot et al., 2019b</a>; Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17) which include specific near-term actions, specific trends to monitor and specific contingency actions to take depending on the future conditions observed. While often more effective at meeting goals, such planned learning processes may pose implementation and governance challenges (<a class="reference-link" href="#Metzger--2021">Metzger et al., 2021</a>)</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.2.2_p5">Mainstreaming adaptation into existing governance structures and associated organisations and their investments, policies and practices can contribute to expanding the solution space and support efforts at transformative adaptation. For instance, urban planning can support adaptation by mainstreaming adaptation into city plans, such as land use planning, procuring resilient infrastructure and transportation, supporting health and social services, promoting community-based adaptation, and protecting and integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services into city planning (Section 17.4.3). Mainstreaming adaptation also shows many shortcomings, such as diminishing the visibility of dedicated, stand-alone adaptation approaches (<a class="reference-link" href="#Persson--2016">Persson et al., 2016</a>), unequal distribution of adaptation efforts, diluting responsibilities for implementation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nalau--2016">Nalau et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Reckien--2019">Reckien et al., 2019</a>), exhibiting disconnects between planning, investment and implementation, having limited policy coherence (<a class="reference-link" href="#Friend--2014">Friend et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bizikova--2015">Bizikova et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#England--2018">England et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Koch--2018">Koch, 2018</a>) and failing to adequately balance overlapping and/or competing policy objectives (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vij--2018">Vij et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.2.2_p6">Finally, governing adaptation in ways that maximise the solution space and facilitate learning can help avoid maladaptation.

This report draws attention to maladaptation challenges recognising that not all adaptation-related responses reduce risks (Chapter 16).

Adaptation finance constitutes a crucial enabling condition and shaper of the solution space, depending on other enabling conditions, such as proper planning, implementation and governance, which are also the triggers for investments and finance to flow, ensuring positive adaptation outcomes. Details of adaptation finance can be found in Chapter 17 (Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE in Chapter 17; Section 17.4). The adaptation and resilience options offer multiple benefits, including avoiding risks and losses, economic growth and well-being, as well as social and environmental benefits (<a class="reference-link" href="#Agrawal--2015">Agrawal and Lemos, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bayleyegn--2018">Bayleyegn et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Global%20Commission%20on%20Adaptation--2019">Global Commission on Adaptation, 2019</a>). Hence, the rate of return on adaptation is large; for example, there is a huge potential of net benefits, that is USD 7.1 trillion while investing USD 1.8 trillion globally in climate resilience and adaptation options, such as early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved dryland agriculture crop production, global mangrove protection and building resilience of water resources (<a class="reference-link" href="#Global%20Commission%20on%20Adaptation--2019">Global Commission on Adaptation, 2019</a>). These net benefits resulted primarily from reducing future losses and risk, increasing productivity and innovation, and social and environmental benefits. Despite significant uncertainty and concerns over undue focus on efficiency (monetary), benefit-cost estimates often ignore important issues of non-economic values, effectiveness of risk reduction and climate justice (procedural/distributional).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-1.2_p2">The current public and private financial flows to adaptation are much smaller than needed (Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE in Chapter 17). Only a small portion of overall adaptation finance needs is likely to be covered by public sector finance. Private sector investment thus needs to play a crucial role. Hence, tracking adaptation finance flows is important for enabling effective planning and prioritisation of investments, assessing whether needs are being met, and ensuring accountability towards funding commitments, such as the USD 100 billion promised to developing countries per year by 2020 under the Paris Agreement (<a class="reference-link" href="#Donner--2016">Donner et al., 2016</a>). Since AR5, significant progress has been made in tracking adaptation finance flows through UNFCCC channels, multi-lateral development banks and bilateral finance (Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE in Chapter 17), but large information gaps on adaptation finance via national public finance, commercial lenders, investors, asset managers and insurers, company finance, and individuals and households remain. That these financial flows do not occur suggests misaligned incentives and other governance challenges that could be addressed as part of a response to climate change (Chapter 17). Across regions and sectors, financial constraints have been identified as the most common and important determinants leading to limits to adaptation (Chapter 16).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-1.3"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 1.3 | Nature-based solutions</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-23-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-1.3_p1">Nature-based solutions (NbS) (Section 2.6; Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2) provides an example of how innovative ideas can expand the climate solution space (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018b">IPCC, 2018b</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Seddon--2019">Seddon et al., 2019</a>). A commonly used definition of NbS is that of The World Conservation Union (IUCN), which defines it as ‘actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cohen-Shacham--2016">Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016</a>). In the context of IPCC, it focuses on NbS which deliver climate change adaptation or mitigation benefits. NbS generally benefits biodiversity and supports its role in both climate mitigation and adaptation. While the carbon-sequestering mitigation role of increasing forest and tree cover has dominated much of the earlier discussions, the role of NbS in promoting adaptation of natural ecosystems and human societies to climate change is being increasingly emphasised. The details of different categories of ecosystem services in the ocean or on land, including biodiversity, food provision, other provisioning services (e.g., medicinal and commercial products), and regulating and cultural services are described in Chapters 2 and 3.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-1.3_p2">Forest restoration would certainly contribute substantially towards climate-proofing and achievement of several SDGs as well as the Paris Agreement.

Such large-scale afforestation may also lead to the dispossession of previous users, such as smallholders and pastoralists. Hence, when NbS include forest plantations or other large-scale conversion of land use, there is a risk that they result in maladaptation and malmitigation, including climate injustice (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seddon--2019">Seddon et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Cousins--2021">Cousins, 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB" id="box-1.3_p4">Much of the conceptual framework for NbS has come from initiatives to bring environmental, social and economic dimensions to the same level of importance, particularly in the context of a highly urbanised society (Section 6.3.3; <a class="reference-link" href="#Faivre--2017">Faivre et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nessh%C3%B6ver--2017">Nesshöver et al., 2017</a>). Emphasis has been placed on urban storm water management (Section 2.6.5.2) and heat mitigation using measures, such as sustainable drainage systems, urban forests, parks and green roof-tops, apart from coastal defences using NbS (Section 13.6.2.3) This has triggered much debate on how distinct the concept of NbS is in relation to other similar concepts, such as ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches (Section 9.11.4.2). There are calls for an assessment framework for proving the ‘effectiveness and efficiency’ of NbS in providing superior ecosystem and societal benefits (Calliari et al., 2019). Instead, EbA can be treated as a subset of NbS (Chapter 2). However, the time frame of EbA is also an important consideration; thus, grassland and forest restoration would operate at different time scales, while mangrove restoration can promote adaptation only at local to national scales, depending on the extent and nature of coastlines (<a class="reference-link" href="#Taillardat--2018">Taillardat et al., 2018</a>). Given the complex nature of plant and animal species adapting to climate change through dispersal and migration to more suitable habitat, this also means that landscape-scale approaches, as opposed to purely protected areas, are needed to promote adaptation, conserve and sustainably use biodiversity, and sustain livelihoods (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vos--2008">Vos et al., 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sukumar--2016">Sukumar et al., 2016</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="cross-chapter-box-adapt"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Cross-Chapter Box ADAPT | Adaptation science</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-24-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Authors: Johanna Nalau (Australia/Finland), Lauren Rickards (Australia), Tabea Lissner (Germany), Katharine J.

Whereas adaptation research was primarily academic during the 1990s and 2000s, it now includes a proliferation of on-the-ground experience of how to adapt to climate change, increasingly documented in reports and papers. Furthermore, academic research on adaptation has diversified significantly. Understanding the characteristics and diversity of this knowledge base is key for it to effectively inform decision making and action on adaptation.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Academic work on adaptation now spans an increasing number of disciplines and countries and is published across diverse academic outlets and disciplines, with 28.5% annual average increase in adaptation specific publications (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nalau--2021">Nalau and Verrall, 2021</a>). This expands the range of considerations and perspectives within adaptation research and increases the challenge of identifying and synthesising all relevant research on adaptation in reviews or assessments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Berrang-Ford--2015">Berrang-Ford et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Webber--2016">Webber, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Singh--2020">Singh et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sietsma--2021">Sietsma et al., 2021</a>). Also, large bodies of research and knowledge exist that support climate adaptation ideas, theoretical development and practical implementation, but are not explicitly framed as climate change adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Dupuis--2013">Dupuis and Biesbroek, 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Biesbroek--2018">Biesbroek et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Keskitalo--2019a">Keskitalo and Preston, 2019a</a>).

Both are needed because research ‘on adaptation’ helpfully investigates the phenomenon and processes of adaptation (e.g., via analyses of others’ adaptation practices and efforts), while research ‘for adaptation’ generates knowledge that can enable the planning and implementation of adaptation (e.g., action research as part of an adaptive capacity-building process) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Swart--2014">Swart et al., 2014</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">One of the contributions of research ‘on adaptation’ is to track and debate the broader trends, core characteristics and overall assumptions embedded in adaptation knowledge. This reflexive turn about the foundational assumptions is itself one emerging trend in adaptation research (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Preston--2013">Preston et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nalau--2015">Nalau et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Juhola--2016">Juhola, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Atteridge--2017">Atteridge and Remling, 2017</a>). This signals the influence of more social science in adaptation research and increased awareness of the practical value of being transparent and critically reflective about the content, topics, frames and approaches that researchers use (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lacey--2015">Lacey et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nalau--2021">Nalau et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Singh--2021">Singh et al., 2021</a>). For example, different conceptions of adaptation contribute to different definitions of ‘adaptation success’, different ideas about what ‘effective’ adaptation practice looks like and, thus, different conclusions about what is and is not working well (<a class="reference-link" href="#Berrang-Ford--2019">Berrang-Ford et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dilling--2019">Dilling et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Magnan--2020">Magnan et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Owen--2020">Owen, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Eriksen--2021">Eriksen et al., 2021</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Singh--2021">Singh et al., 2021</a>; Section 17.5.1.1). This diversity adds richness and options, but also poses challenges in constructing a conventional evidence base for decision and policymaking. Adaptation researchers are increasingly expected to offer clear and confident advice on adaptation success, yet are also increasingly aware of how context-specific and contested success is (see also <a class="reference-link" href="#Lacey--2015">Lacey et al., 2015</a> on ethics).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Grey literature on adaptation is also proliferating, typically authored by organisations funding and implementing adaptation.

However, most of the lessons learned through implementation of adaptation projects and programmes are still not captured in academic or even grey literature and thus remain less systematically analysed.

Whereas AR5 noted transformational adaptation as an area of future research (<a class="reference-link" href="#Klein--2014b">Klein et al., 2014b</a>), it has continued to grow in profile since then. Rather than a future or fringe consideration—for example, an extreme action necessitated by the limits of incremental adaptation— transformational adaptation is increasingly an option that decision makers are considering today. This increasing attention to transformational adaptation is driven by a growing recognition of climate risks and impacts, as well as the need for urgent, systemic action as laid out in the IPCC’s recent special reports (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018c">IPCC, 2018c</a>).

Rather than a binary outcome (successful or unsuccessful), adaptation can be viewed on a continuum from successful adaptation to maladaptation (Section 17.5.2). Assessments of adaptation success need to account for distributional effects and differential vulnerability, as well as consider connections across different scales and complex interactions with other change processes (Section 17.5.1).

Understanding the potential for maladaptation may also require such assessments (Section 1.4.2). Processes, such as adaptive pathways, that involve anticipating future responses (Boxes 11.4; 11.6; Sections 11.7; 17.3) entail monitoring to detect early warning of approaching thresholds or changes in the solution space (e.g., more rapid than expected sea level rise or new social acceptance of managed retreat) that suggest the need or opportunity to adjust or expand current adaptation efforts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Haasnoot--2021">Haasnoot et al., 2021</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="1.4.4"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">1.4.4 Limits to Adaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-14-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.4.4_p1">The effectiveness of adaptation efforts also depends on the constraints and limits that human and natural systems face when confronted with increasingly higher levels of climate risks.

Residual risk is also used as other terms such as ‘residual impacts’, ‘residual loss and damage’ and ‘residual damage’. As noted in AR5 WGII (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014a">IPCC, 2014a</a>, b), the residual risk is larger or smaller depending on a society’s choices about the appropriate level of adaptation and its ability to achieve an appropriate level. The intersection of inequality and poverty presents significant adaptation limits, resulting in residual impacts for vulnerable groups, including women, youth, elderly, ethnic and religious minorities, Indigenous People and refugees (Section 8.4.5). An appropriate level of adaptation, which ideally reflects a balance between the desired level of risk and the actions needed to achieve that level of risk, depends on the solution space, the society’s views on climate justice, the tolerance for climate-related risks, the society’s tolerance for the costs and other impacts of the actions needed to reduce risk. IPCC’s special reports stated that residual risks rise with increasing global temperatures from 1.5°C to 2°C (SR 1.5) and emerge from irreversible forms of land degradation (SRCCL). Among other risks, this report evidenced that, at risk to coastal flooding from sea level rise, nature-based adaptation measures (e.g., coral reefs, mangroves, marshes) reach hard limits beginning at 1.5<span class="subscript CharOverride-2" lang>°</span>C of global warming (Chapter 16). Residual risks may lead to exceeding the limits of adaptation, hence, this report underscores on the role of decision making on transformational adaptation for dealing with residual risk as well as soft and hard adaptation limits (Cross-Chapter Box LOSS in Chapter 17).

The loss and damage associated with the future climate change impacts, beyond the limits to adaptation, is an area of increasing focus, although yet to be fully developed in terms of methods of assessment. This includes non-economic losses and damages, as well as identifying means to avoid and reduce both economic (loss of asset, infrastructure, land etc.) and non-economic (loss of societal beliefs and values, cultural heritage, biodiversity and ecosystem services) losses and damages (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fankhauser--2014">Fankhauser and Dietz, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Andrei--2015">Andrei et al., 2015</a>). There is increasing evidence of economic and non-economic losses due to climate extremes and slow onset events under observed increases in global temperatures (Section 8.3.4; <a class="reference-link" href="#Coronese--2019">Coronese et al., 2019</a>; Grinsted et al., 2019; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kahn--2019">Kahn et al., 2019</a>), however assessment of non-economic losses and damages is lacking and needs more attention (Serdeczny et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tschakert--2019">Tschakert et al., 2019</a>).

SREX generally used the phrase transformation to refer to fundamental societal changes that advance climate adaptation, disaster risk management and sustainable development. Transformation was seen as one part of the solution space alongside options such as reducing vulnerability and exposure, and increasing resilience for managing risk. WGII of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report used the phrase ‘transformational adaptation’ to contrast with ‘incremental adaptation’. That report used the former term to refer to: (a) adaptation at large scope or scale, (b) the type of adaptation that occurs once soft limits have been breached, or (c) change that addresses root causes of vulnerability as well as redressing long-standing inequities.

In the former case, incremental adaptation may stay within soft limits and hold risks to tolerable levels that avoid threatening private or social norms (also see Figure 17.6). In the latter case, deliberate transformational adaptation is necessary to reach the goals. Alternatively, if deliberate transformation does not successfully occur or hard limits are exceeded, the system may nonetheless undergo some type of forced transformation which results in outcomes inconsistent with societal goals. While the figure shows single decision points, multiple actors are involved at each stage. Thus, some people may find themselves coping with what they regard as intolerable risks which are not otherwise avoided.

The sustainability transitions literature provides one central focus for understanding such processes and potential intervention points for actors seeking change (<a class="reference-link" href="#K%C3%B6hler--2019">Köhler et al., 2019</a>). This literature identifies three, interacting scales: the micro, meso and macro.(<a class="reference-link" href="#Geels--2004">Geels, 2004</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#K%C3%B6hler--2019">Köhler et al., 2019</a>) The micro level reflects changing individual choices, attitudes and motivations. The meso reflects socio-technical systems, ‘a cluster of elements, including technology, regulations, user practices and markets, cultural meanings, infrastructure, maintenance networks and supply networks’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Geels--2004">Geels, 2004</a>, p. 436). The macro reflects the cultures, institutions, norms, governance and other broad organising features of society. The sustainability transitions literature generally focuses on change that originates and occurs within the meso scale, while the transformation literature focuses on change within and among all scales. This Working Group II report often considers three interacting scales labelled personal, practical and political (<a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Brien--2013">O’Brien and Sygna, 2013</a>). Working Group III often employs the multi-level perspectives framework (<a class="reference-link" href="#Geels--2004">Geels, 2004</a>) and the more actor-oriented three domains of decision making framework (WGIII Section 1.6.4; <a class="reference-link" href="#Grubb--2014">Grubb et al., 2014</a>;) to describe related societal scales.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.2_p3">These literatures describe similar processes through which these interacting elements generate significant system change. In the sustainability transitions literature, the process begins with a stable system of actors, technologies and institutions (<a class="reference-link" href="#K%C3%B6hler--2019">Köhler et al., 2019</a>). Radical innovations begin in niches or protected spaces, sometimes introduced by new entrants or outsiders. Successful innovations expand in scale, scope and geographically, and ultimately help generate new regimes. Incumbent actors can support or resist innovations through combinations of government policies, economic forces and institutional and behavioural pressures. Such processes can, but need not, follow a common S-curve pattern of initial adoption, take-off, acceleration and stabilisation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rotmans--2001">Rotmans et al., 2001</a>). The multi-level perspectives literature in WGIII similarly describes innovations as moving from niches to socio-technical regimes, at first mediated by and then potentially altering exogenous socio-technical landscapes (WGIII Section 1.6.4; <a class="reference-link" href="Smith--2010">Smith et al., 2010</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.2_p4">The socio-ecological systems literature, a main source of the resilience concept, focuses on the system elements of society and ecosystems, their interdependence and on how they change in response to shocks (Section 1.2.1.4). Coupled human and natural systems maintain their vital functions through what are called adaptive cycles that begin with growth, reach a period of stasis, experience a disruption and then reorganise. This repeating cycle can leave the system unchanged or transition it to new states. Human agency can alter system characteristics so that after any disruption the system will reorganise into a different, more desired state, guide the reorganisation in desired directions after a system shock (such as a natural disaster) or provide the shock that catalyses a reorganisation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.2_p5">These literatures view incremental and transformational change as linked processes. In the transformational adaptation literature, <a class="reference-link" href="#Park--2012">Park et al. (2012)</a> consider incremental and transformational adaptation as two concentric and linked action-learning cycles with similar steps that include monitoring and learning. Systems generally reside in the incremental cycle but can temporarily jump to the transformational cycle before returning to the incremental, albeit in a state with fundamentally changed attributes. Shifts from the incremental to transformational cycle are made possible by knowledge and skills, as well as adjustments to vision, agendas and coalitions achieved through monitoring and learning. The incremental cycle is characterised by reactive responses to external drivers and performance evaluation relative to past performance. Shifts to the transformational cycle are characterised by more pro-active responses and more expansive problem framings.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.2_p6">The socio-ecological and sustainability transitions literature describes transitions as often nonlinear, characterised by tipping point behaviour with periods of relative stability interspersed with periods of more rapid change as thresholds are crossed (<a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Ginkel--2020">van Ginkel et al., 2020</a>). Actors seeking transformation may take incremental steps that aim to induce such tipping point behaviour (<a class="reference-link" href="#Otto--2020b">Otto et al., 2020b</a>). For instance, full accounting of climate risk in insurance and financial lending decisions could similarly act as such social tipping point interventions for adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hill--2019">Hill and Martinez-Diaz, 2019</a>). Transformations need not, however, be equitable or smooth. Historical examples suggest the potential for rigidity traps, in which suppression of innovation and a high degree of connectivity in a system delay an eventual transformation, which, when it eventually occurs, unfolds as exceptionally harsh (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hegmon--2008">Hegmon et al., 2008</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.2_p7">Many actors can contribute to launching or blocking significant system change. Pelling et al. (2015) highlights power relationships within and among activity spheres that influence the process of transformational adaptation and distribution of risks. In the sustainability transitions literature each set of actors—including those from academia, politics, industry, civil society and households—brings their own resources, capabilities, beliefs, strategies and interests, which affects their interest, objectives, ability to affect the process and their ability to affect others (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kern--2018">Kern and Rogge, 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.2_p8">There is no consensus in the literature on the best means for actors to pursue deliberate transformation (Section 1.5.1) and the extent to which actors can guide the process.

The incremental actions aim to promote learning, remove barriers to change ( <a class="reference-link" href="#Dasgupta--2018">Dasgupta et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Baresi--2020">Baresi et al., 2020</a>), create a series of wins that generate momentum and generate positive feedbacks (e.g., by creating constituencies) such that the speed and scale of the climate action grows over time (<a class="reference-link" href="#Levin--2012">Levin et al., 2012</a>). However, incremental strategies can fail to move fast enough, can succumb to path-dependency that locks in initially helpful but long-term adverse responses (such as the well-known levee effect) (Sadoff 2015; Haasnoot 2019) or can result in a transition that meets some goals (e.g., environmental) but not others (e.g., equity) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.2_p10">This report describes decision frameworks and tools that can help those involved in such a process—acting independently or collectively—identify, evaluate, seek compromise on and then implement sequences of solutions that lead to pathways with more desirable outcomes and avoid pathways with less desirable outcomes (Section 17.3.1). For instance, adaptive (also called adaptation) pathways (Cross-Chapter Boxes SLR in <a class="section-link" data-title="Human Influence on the Climate System" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-3">Chapter 3</a> and DEEP in Chapter 17) explicitly chart alternative sequences of actions including near-term steps, indicators to monitor and contingency actions to take if pre-determined monitoring thresholds are breached. Employed in contexts with multiple actors and contested values, adaptive pathways frame deliberate transformation as both a near-term decision problem focused on physical, financial and natural resources, as well as a social change process of co-evolving knowledge, policies, institutions, values, rules and norms (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fazey--2016">Fazey et al., 2016</a>). Transition management (<a class="reference-link" href="#Loorbach--2010">Loorbach, 2010</a>), rooted in the sustainability transitions literature, supports arenas of actors that co-produce visions of future change, plan pathways and recruit additional actors into the change process.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.2_p11">As a central feature, such frameworks and tools embrace: (a) multiple objectives and measures (Section 1.4.1.2) to help identify and consider trade-offs among parties with a diversity of interests, values and objectives and (b) multiple scenarios that enable stress-testing of proposed actions to identify conditions in which they would fail to meet their goals and thus inform consideration of ways to make those actions more robust and resilient over multiple futures in the near and longer term (Chapter 17; Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17). A focus on single or overly aggregated measures (Section 1.4.1.2) and single scenarios can privilege some actors’ views over others, reduce transparency and make it more difficult to identify resilient and equitable solutions to complex, deeply uncertain, non-linear and contested problems (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schoen--1994">Schoen and and Rein, 1994</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Renn--2008">Renn, 2008</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2014">Jones et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Lempert--2020">Lempert and Turner, 2020</a>) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.2_p12">Nonetheless, most concepts of deliberate transformation also emphasise the importance of common goals and principles within a process of goal setting, acting on those goals, M&amp;E and readjustment. Such goals encourage pro-active action, help align the activities of multiple, loosely co-ordinated actors (<a class="reference-link" href="#G%C3%B6pel--2016">Göpel, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dasgupta--2018">Dasgupta et al., 2018</a>) and provide benchmarks against which to measure progress (<a class="reference-link" href="#Young--2017">Young, 2017</a>). The Paris Agreement and SDGs aim to provide such common goals for the world as a whole and implement what some have described as goal-based as opposed to rule-based governance for galvanising collective action (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sachs--2015">Sachs, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kanie--2017">Kanie and Biermann, 2017</a>). As intended, many public sector, private sector and civil society actors have developed their own goals that aim to align with the Paris Agreement and the SDGs (see Section 1.1). The existence of goals that help people envision a future significantly different than present can be one, often key, difference between decision processes that pursue transformational as opposed to incremental change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Park--2012">Park et al., 2012</a>; Chapter 17). Narratives that help explain where a community is, where it wants to go and how it intends to get there are an important enabler of transformation (Sections 1.5.1; 1.2.3; <a class="reference-link" href="#Linn%C3%A9r--2019">Linnér and Wibeck, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fazey--2020">Fazey et al., 2020</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="1.5.3"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">1.5.3 Climate Resilient Development <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-17-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.3_p1">Adaptation and mitigation can reduce climate-related risks. Implementing these two types of climate action together increases their effectiveness by exploiting synergies and reducing trade-offs among them. In addition, implementing adaptation and mitigation as an integral part of development can similarly make all three more effective (Section 18.2.3). The link between climate change and sustainable development has long been recognised and has been assessed in every Working Group II report since AR3. AR5 introduced the concept of climate resilient development to help assess development trajectories that include co-ordinated adaptation and mitigation actions aimed at reducing climate risk.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.3_p2">Building on AR5, this AR6 report expands the focus with increased attention to equity and the processes needed to follow such trajectories. AR6 thus defines <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">climate resilient development </span> as ‘a process of implementing GHG mitigation and adaptation solutions to support sustainable development for all’ (Section 18.1.1). In AR6 WGII, some chapters have a section dedicated to climate resilient development, emphasising the need for integrative and transformative solutions within a sector or region that address the uneven distribution of climate risks among different groups and geographies, as well as extend the goals of these solutions to more than reducing risk, such as in improving social, economic and ecological outcomes (Sections 2.6.7; 4.1; 5.14.4; 6.4.8; 7.4.3.5; 7.4.5; 10.6; 11.8; 15.7; 17.6; Boxes 4.7; 13.3; 8.10). Multiple chapters also employ the concept of climate resilient development to identify and balance trade-offs and make progress on achieving the SDGs (Sections 6.1.3; 7.4.5; 10.6; 13.11; 15.7; 16.6.4.3; Box 4.7; Chapter 18).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.3_p3">Climate resilient development requires large and equitable changes in human and natural systems. As noted in Section 1.5.1, the SR1.5 finds that four transitions in socioeconomic systems—energy, land and ecosystems, urban and infrastructure, and industrial—must occur at large scale and rapid rate in order to achieve climate resilient development. This report notes that transitions of such scale, even when beneficial for many people, can also impose significant adverse impacts on others, in particular on marginal and vulnerable populations (Section 18.1.2). This report identifies a fifth socioeconomic transition, that in societal systems that ‘drive innovation, preferences for alternative patterns of consumption and development, and the power relationships among different actors that engage in climate resilient development (Section 18.1.4). Such societal transitions are necessary to ensure the other four transitions unfold at sufficient speed and scale to meet the goals of Paris and the SDGs, as well as to ensure equity in these transitions.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.3_p4">Introduced in the WGII AR5 (Olsson et al., 2014), and further addressed in SR1.5, climate resilient development pathways are trajectories that strengthen sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities, while promoting fair and equitable reductions of GHG emissions, and serve to steer societies towards low-carbon, prosperous and ecologically safe futures. This report defines a <span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">climate resilient development pathway</span> as a trajectory in time reflecting a particular sequence of actions and consequences against a background of autonomous developments leading to a specific future situation (Section 18.1.2). Such a pathway emerges from the spatially and temporally distributed choices of many different actors in government, business, civic organisations and households at the individual, community, national and international levels. As such, there is no single or preferred pathway for climate resilient development and no single best combination of adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development strategies. All pathways involve complex trade-offs and synergies among different actions (Sections 18.1.4; 18.2.2). All pathways are subject to hard-to-predict shocks, both adverse, such as climate disasters, and beneficial, such as new technologies or shifts in public values. The pathway that emerges will represent the results of negotiation, cooperation and competition among actors at many scales, whose differing values and objectives would favour differing trajectories (Section 18.1.4). Individual actors at various scales will determine the mix of adaptation, mitigation and development appropriate for their development context and goals, while also influenced by the desire for their collective actions to become consistent with the global policy goals, such as those in the Paris Agreement and the SDGs (Section 18.1.2). The norms, institutions and power relationships that mediate such choices determine the extent to which the process unfolds consistent with principles of equity and social justice (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.5.3_p5">Enabling conditions that can accelerate climate resilient development include governance, finance, economy, and science, technology and information (Sections 18.4.2; 18.9.2). The pursuit of equity and justice are both an enabler and an outcome of climate resilient development (Section 18.1.4). Climate resilient development involves a process of action, learning and response (Section 1.5.2), so the capability for such monitoring and iterative risk management also represents an important enabling condition (Section 18.1.4.2). Governments have an important role to play in expanding the solution space, often focusing on technology, policy and finance. Expanding the solution space also requires a broader set of actors. Chapter 18 and other chapters in this report use the climate resilient development concept to highlight the role of citizens, civil society, knowledge institutions, media, investors and businesses, and the importance of expanding the arenas of engagement in which they interact.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="1.6"><h1 class="Headings_H1-numbered" lang="en-GB">1.6 Structure of the Report </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-7-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB" id="1.6_p1">The IPCC mandate involves the provisioning of available scientific information and evidence to inform climate action by multiple actors, notably governments (including international alliances) in the context of UNFCCC.

Existing international frameworks provide a high-level direction for coordinating, financing and assessing progress toward these goals. However, specifying the goals for specific adaptation actions is not straightforward because the impacts of climate change affect people and nature in many different ways requiring different adaptation actions. Thereby, goals that accompany these actions are diverse. Goals can relate to health, water or food security, jobs and employment, poverty eradication and social equity, biodiversity and ecosystem services at international, national and local levels. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 1.1_p2">Climate change adaptation entails the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate change and its effects in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. At a high level, international frameworks, including the Paris Agreement and the SDGs, have come to provide a direction for coordinating, financing and assessing global progress in these terms. The Paris Agreement calls for climate change adaptation actions, referring to these actions as those that reduce risk and vulnerability, strengthen resilience, enhance the capacity to anticipate and respond successfully, and ensure the availability of necessary financial resources, as these processes and outcomes relate to climate change. In addition, the Sustainable Development Goals include 17 targets (with a specific goal SDG 13 on climate action) to fulfil its mission to end extreme poverty by 2030, protect the planet and build more peaceful, just and inclusive societies. These goals are difficult to reach without successful adaptation to climate change. Other notable frameworks that identify climate change adaptation as important global priorities include the SFDRR, the finance-oriented Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the New Urban Agenda.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 1.1_p3">While vital for international finance, coordination and assessment, the global goals set forth by these frameworks and conventions do not necessarily provide sufficient guidance to plan, implement or evaluate specific adaptation efforts at the community level. Specifying goals of adaptation is harder than setting goals for reducing emissions of climate-warming GHG emissions. For instance, emission reduction effort is ultimately measured by the total amount of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere. Instead, adaptation aims to reduce risk and vulnerability from climate change and helps to enhance well-being in each individual community worldwide.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 1.1_p4">Because the impacts of climate change affect people and nature in so many different ways, the specific goals of adaptation depend on the impact being managed and the action being taken. For human systems, adaptation includes actions aimed at reducing a specific risk, such as by fortifying a building against flooding, or actions aimed at multiple risks, such as requiring climate risk assessments in financial reporting in anticipation of different kinds of risk. At the local level, communities can take actions that include updating building codes and land use plans, improving soil management, enhancing water use efficiency, supporting migrants and taking measures to reduce poverty. For natural systems, adaptation includes organisms changing behaviours, migrating to new locations and genetic modifications in response to changing climate conditions. The goals for these adaptation actions can relate to health, water or food security, jobs and employment, poverty eradication and social equity, biodiversity and ecosystem services, among others. Articulating the goals of adaptation thus requires engaging with the concepts of equity, justice and effectiveness at the international, national and local levels.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 1.2"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 1.2 | Is climate change adaptation urgent?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-27-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Climate impacts, such as stronger heat waves, longer droughts, more frequent floods, accelerating sea level rise and storm surges, are already being observed in some regions, and people around the world are increasingly perceiving changing climates, regarding these changes as significant and considering climate action as a matter of high urgency.

At smaller scales, such as local and national, goals are dependent on the specific impacts being managed, the actions being taken and the relevant scale. While success can take shape as uniquely as goals can, the degree to which an adaptation is feasible, effective and conforms to principles of justice represents important attributes for measuring success across actions. Adaptation responses that lead to increased risk and impacts are considered maladaptation. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 1.3_p2">Altogether, adaptation success is dependent on the extent to which adaptation actions achieve their respective goals of reducing climate risk, increasing resilience and pursuing other climate-related societal goals. Viewed globally, successful adaptation consists of actions anticipated to make significant contributions to meeting SDGs, such as ending extreme poverty, hunger and discrimination, and reduce risks to ecosystems, water, food systems, human settlements, and health and well-being. Viewed locally, successful adaptation consists of actions that help communities meet their diverse goals, including reducing anticipated current and future risks, enhancing capacity to adapt and transform, avoiding maladaptation, yielding benefits greater than costs and serving vulnerable populations, and arising from an inclusive, evidence-based and equitable decision process.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 1.3_p3">While success can be unique to an adaptation action, there are important attributes that constitute it as a successful solution.

These considerations are based on financial or economic, political, physical, historical and social factors, depending on what is required for an action to be implemented. The degree to which an action is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>effective</span> depends on the extent it reduces climate risk, as well as the extent an action achieves its intended goals or outcomes. An adaptation action can sometimes—usually inadvertently—increase risk or vulnerability for some or all affected individuals or communities. In some cases, such risk increases will be sufficient to call the actions maladaptation. The degree to which an action is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>just </span> is when its outcomes, the process of implementing the action and the process of choosing the action respects principles of distributive, procedural and recognitional justice. Distributive justice refers to the different distributions of benefits and burdens of an action across members of society; procedural justice refers to ensuring the opportunity for fairness, transparency, inclusion and impartiality in the decision making of an action; and recognitional justice insists on recognising and including those who are or may be most affected by an action.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 1.3_p5">These attributes of adaptation success can be assessed throughout the adaptation process of planning, implementation, Monitoring &amp; Evaluation, adjustment and learning.

Other actions are transformational, leading to changes in the fundamental characteristics of a system. For instance, building a seawall to protect a coastal community from flooding might exemplify incremental adaptation. Changing land use regulations in that community and establishing a programme of managed retreat might exemplify transformational adaptation. There is no definitive line between incremental and transformational adaptation. Some incremental actions stay incremental. Others may expand the future space of solutions. For instance, including climate risk in mortgages and insurance might at first seem incremental but might lead to more transformational change over time.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 1.4_p4">Transformation can be deliberate, envisioned and intended by at least some societal actors, or forced, arising without explicit intent.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 1.4_p5">Deliberate transformational adaptation is not without risks because change can disturb existing power relationships and can unfold in difficult to predict and unintended ways.

In addition, some types of societal transformation may be inevitable and deliberate rather than forced transformation and may bring society closer to its goals.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 1.4_p6">Some types of transformation may be inevitable because the amount of transformational adaptation needed to avoid intolerable risks depends in part on the level of GHG mitigation. Low concentration pathways consistent with Paris Agreement goals require deliberate transformations that lead to significant and rapid change in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems. Even with low concentration pathways, some transformational adaptation will be necessary to limit intolerable risks. But with higher concentration pathways, more extensive transformational adaptation would be required to limit (though not entirely avoid) intolerable risks. In such circumstances, insufficient deliberate transformation could lead to undesirable forced transformations.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 1.5"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 1.5 | What is new in this 6th IPCC report on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-29-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Since IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, many new sources of knowledge have been employed to provide better understanding of climate change risks, impacts, vulnerability and also societal responses through adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development.

The literature also increasingly evaluates the lived experiences of climate change—the physical changes underway, the impacts for people and ecosystems, the perceptions of the risks, and adaptation and mitigation responses planned and implemented.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US" id="FAQ 1.5_p6">The assessment in AR6 is more integrative across multiple disciplines and combines experts across Working Groups, chapters, papers and disciplines, such as natural and social sciences, medical and health sciences, engineering, humanities, law and business administration. The emphasis on knowledge for action has also included the role of public communication, stories and narratives within assessment and associated outreach.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_References_head" lang="en-GB"><span>References</span> </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-8-siblings"><p class="References_References_body" id="references_p1" lang="en-GB">Abrahamson, V., et al., 2009: Perceptions of heatwave risks to health: interview-based study of older people in London and Norwich, UK. <span class="condensed_italic" lang>J.
