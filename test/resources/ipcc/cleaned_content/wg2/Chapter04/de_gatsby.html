Water insecurity arises from many factors, both environmental and societal. Environmental factors include too little freshwater due to drought or pollution, and too much water, due to extreme precipitation and flooding, and are being affected by climate change. Societal factors include economic and governance-related barriers to water access or protection from water-related damages.

For example, since the 1970s, 44% of all disaster events have been flood-related (<a class="reference-link" href="#WMO--2020">WMO, 2020</a>). With the added stressor of climate change, globally, a larger fraction of land and population are projected to face increased water scarcity due to climate change. For example, at an approximately 2°C GWL, between 0.9 and 3.9 billion people are projected to be at increased exposure to water stress, depending on regional patterns of climate change and the socioeconomic scenarios considered (<a class="reference-link" href="#Koutroulis--2019">Koutroulis et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Second, while climate change directly affects freshwater availability across space and time, it also affects water requirements for different uses, such as irrigation, potentially adding to existing societal challenges (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bijl--2018">Bijl et al., 2018</a>). Vulnerability to water-related impacts of climate change and extreme weather are already felt in all major sectors and are projected to intensify in the future, for example, in agriculture (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Sections 4.3.1, 4.5.1); energy and industry (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> for observed drought impacts and projected impacts) (Sections 4.3.2, 4.5.2); water for health and sanitation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> about links to precipitation extremes and disease outbreaks) (Sections 4.3.3, 4.5.3); water for urban, peri-urban and municipal sectors (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>) (Sections 4.3.4, 4.5.4) and freshwater ecosystems (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> in climate change as a driver in degradation of freshwater ecosystems) (Sections 4.3.5, 4.5.5). Agriculture and irrigation account for the most significant proportion of consumptive water use and account for 60–70% of total water withdrawals (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hanasaki--2018">Hanasaki et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Burke--2020">Burke et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#M%C3%BCller%20Schmied--2021">Müller Schmied et al., 2021</a>). Globally, 10% of the most water-stressed basins account for 35% of global irrigated calorie production (<a class="reference-link" href="#Qin--2019">Qin et al., 2019</a>), and food production is at risk in those basins and worldwide due to changes in hydrological components of climate change. Lack of access to clean water and sanitation has been one of the leading causes of water-borne diseases. In 2017, approximately 2.2 billion people lacked access to safe drinking water, and roughly 4.2 billion people could not access safe sanitation (<a class="reference-link" href="#WHO%20and%20UNICEF--2019">WHO and UNICEF, 2019</a>). Inequities in access to safe water are being amplified during the current COVID-19 pandemic (Box 4. 5 and Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7). The same 10% of most water-stressed basins also account for 19% of global thermal electricity generation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Qin--2019">Qin et al., 2019</a>), and globally, both production of hydropower and thermal power has been negatively affected by droughts and other extreme events. Globally, between 16% and 39% of cities experienced surface-water deficits between 1971 and 2000. If environmental flow requirements (EFRs) are accounted for, these numbers increase to 36% and 63%, respectively. Even under a scenario where urban water gets the highest priority, more than 440.5 million people in cities globally are projected to face a water deficit by 2050 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fl%C3%B6rke--2018">Flörke et al., 2018</a>). The situation is particularly precarious in the Global South, where most of the population lacks access to piped water (<a class="reference-link" href="#WRI--2019">WRI, 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Third, a large majority (~60%) of all adaptation responses documented since 2014 are about adapting to water-related hazards like droughts, floods and rainfall variability (<a class="reference-link" href="#Berrang-Ford--2021b">Berrang-Ford et al., 2021b</a>) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Water-related adaptation action features prominently in NDC pledges by a large majority of countries in both Global North and Global South (<a class="reference-link" href="#GWP--2018">GWP, 2018</a>). These adaptation responses and their current benefits and effectiveness in reducing water-related risks in the future are systematically assessed in this chapter (Sections 4.6, 4.7.1, 4.7.2 and 4.7.3). These adaptation measures aim to reduce impacts of water-related hazards through responses such as irrigation, water and soil moisture conservation, rainwater harvesting, changes in crops and cultivars, improved agronomic practices, among others (Sections 4.6.2; 4.7.1). Only ~20% of all documented case studies on observed water-related adaptations measure outcomes (positive or negative), but the link between positive outcomes and climate risk reduction is unclear and remains challenging to assess (<a class="section-link" data-title="Current Water-Related Adaptation Responses, Benefits, Co-benefits and Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.1">Section 4.7.1</a>) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>). On the other hand, most of the future projected water-related adaptations are more effective at lower GWLs (1.5°C) than at higher GWLs, showing the importance of mitigation for future adaptations to remain effective (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Finally, while limiting global warming to 1.5°C would minimise the increase in risks in the various water use sectors and keep adaptation effective, many mitigation measures can potentially impact future water security. For example, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation and reforestation can have a considerable water footprint if done at inappropriate locations (<a class="section-link" data-title="Trade-Offs and Synergies between Water-Related Adaptation and Mitigation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.6">Section 4.7.6</a>, see also <a class="reference-link" href="#Canadell--2021">Canadell et al., 2021</a>).

AR6 uses new projections (CMIP6) based on the SSPs and other scenarios, and we assess those results in this chapter alongside those using other projections and scenarios.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Second, this chapter follows the developments set in motion by SR1.5, SRCCL and SROCC to incorporate Indigenous knowledge (IK), traditional knowledge (TK) and local knowledge (LK). SR1.5 stated that disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, including Indigenous Peoples and certain local communities, are at disproportionately higher risk of suffering adverse consequences due to global warming of 1.5°C or more (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy et al., 2018</a>). SRCCL highlighted the enhanced efficacy of decision-making and governance with the involvement of local stakeholders, particularly those most vulnerable to climate change, such as Indigenous Peoples (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arneth--2019">Arneth et al., 2019</a>). SROCC found adaptation efforts have benefited from the inclusion of IK and LK (IKLK) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Abram--2019">Abram et al., 2019</a>). In this chapter, we engage directly with Indigenous contributing authors and use multiple evidence-based approaches, as undertaken by the IPBES (<a class="reference-link" href="#Teng%C3%B6--2014">Tengö et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Teng%C3%B6--2017">Tengö et al., 2017</a>). This approach is guided by the understanding that the co-production of knowledge (between scholars and local communities) about water and climate change vulnerability, impacts and adaptation has the potential to lead to new water knowledge and context-specific governance strategies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arsenault--2019">Arsenault et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chakraborty--2021">Chakraborty and Sherpa, 2021</a>). Additionally, shifting beyond the exclusive use of technical knowledge and Western viewpoints redresses the shortcomings of resource- and security-oriented understandings to water and acknowledges the more holistic and relational approaches common to IKLK (<a class="section-link" data-title="Inclusion of Indigenous Knowledge and Local Knowledge" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.8.4">Section 4.8.4</a>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Stefanelli--2017">Stefanelli et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wilson--2019">Wilson, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chakraborty--2021">Chakraborty and Sherpa, 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Finally, grounded in the AR6 goal to expand the solution space, this chapter advances the understanding of adaptation in the water sector since AR5 by deploying a meta-analysis of adaptation measures. The meta-analysis focuses on both current adaptation responses (<a class="section-link" data-title="Current Water-Related Adaptation Responses, Benefits, Co-benefits and Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.1">Section 4.7.1</a>) and future projected adaptation responses, which have been modelled (<a class="section-link" data-title="Projections of Future Effectiveness of Adaptation Responses" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.2">Section 4.7.2</a>). The meta-review assesses the outcomes of current adaptation responses and effectiveness of future projected adaptations in reducing climate and associated risks. Studies derived from the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) database (<a class="reference-link" href="#Berrang-Ford--2021a">Berrang-Ford et al., 2021a</a>) (see Chapter 16) were coded systematically following a meta-review protocol developed specifically for this assessment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mukherji--2021">Mukherji et al., 2021</a>; SM4.2). A similar meta-review protocol was also developed to assess effectiveness of adaptations to reduce projected climate risks (<a class="section-link" data-title="Projections of Future Effectiveness of Adaptation Responses" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.2">Section 4.7.2</a>; SM4.2).</p></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-4.1"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 4.1 | Implications of Climate Change for Water Scarcity and Water Insecurity</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-57-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Water scarcity and water insecurity are related concepts but not identical, and each has a range of interpretations leading to some overlap. Water scarcity can be broadly described as a mismatch between the demand for fresh water and its availability, quantified in physical terms. Water security/insecurity is a broader concept with definitions beyond physical water scarcity, encompassing access to water services, safety from poor water quality and flooding, and appropriate water governance that ensures access to safe water (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sadoff--2020">Sadoff et al., 2020</a>). Metrics of water security include both physical and socioeconomic components and are a tool for comparison between different locations and countries regarding relative levels of water security in the context of water-related risks. Some definitions of water scarcity also incorporate these broader issues. For example, ‘economic water scarcity’ has been defined as a situation where ‘human, institutional, and financial capital limit access to water, even though water in nature is available locally to meet human demands’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Comprehensive%20Assessment%20of%20Water%20Management%20in%20Agriculture--2007">Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture, 2007</a>). Economic water scarcity can also occur where infrastructure exists, but water distribution is inequitable (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jaeger--2017">Jaeger et al., 2017</a>). Much of the literature exploring the impacts of climate change on water security, however, focuses on quantifying physical water scarcity. Discussions in this box consider physical water scarcity as a quantifiable measure of water availability compared to its demand and consider the societal elements of economic water scarcity to be part of the more comprehensive concept of water insecurity.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H1" lang="en-GB">Physical water scarcity</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Definitions of water scarcity have evolved to take account of a broader set of factors. For example, physical water scarcity indicates that an insufficient quantity of water is available to meet requirements. A commonly used measure of physical water scarcity is the Falkenmark index which measures the amount of renewable freshwater available per capita (<a class="reference-link" href="#Falkenmark--1989">Falkenmark et al., 1989</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#White--2014">White et al., 2014</a>). However, the Falkenmark index is now regarded as an incomplete measure, as it does not account for water needed for non-human needs (as quantified with EFRs). Therefore, EFRs have begun to be incorporated in recent water scarcity assessments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2016">Liu et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2017b">Liu et al., 2017b</a>). Quality-induced water scarcity is an additional factor beginning to be considered (<a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2020">Liu and Zhao, 2020</a>) .</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Using a Water Scarcity Index (WSI) defined as the ratio of demand and availability, accounting for EFRs, it is estimated that 4 billion people live under conditions of severe water scarcity for at least one month per year (Figure Box 4.1.1a; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mekonnen--2016">Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016</a>). Nearly half of these people live in India and China. Although regions with high water scarcity are already naturally dry (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>virtually certain</span><span class="superscript-condensed_italic _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span>), <span class="superscript CharOverride-1" lang><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="ch04.html#footnote-000">1</a> </span></span>human influence on climate is leading to reduced water availability in many regions. It is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>very likely </span> that global patterns of soil moisture change are being driven by human influence on climate, and an overall global decline in soil moisture is attributable to greenhouse forcing [4.2.1.3]. Climate change patterns of streamflow change include declines in western North America, northeast South America, the Mediterranean and South Asia (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>) [4.2.3]. However, quantification of the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to current levels of water scarcity is not yet available.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Water demand is projected to change as a direct result of socioeconomic changes. For example, the global water demand for domestic, industrial and agricultural uses, at present about 4600 km³ yr <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>–1</span>, is projected to increase by 20–30% by 2050 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Greve--2018">Greve et al., 2018</a>), depending on the socioeconomic scenario. Changes in water availability and demand have been projected in several studies using climate models and socioeconomic scenarios (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Arnell--2014">Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Gosling--2016">Gosling and Arnell, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Greve--2018">Greve et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Koutroulis--2019">Koutroulis et al., 2019</a>). In such studies, the projected changes in water availability arise from differences in precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET). However, both precipitation and evapotranspiration are also subject to very high uncertainty in key processes such as regional climate change patterns (<a class="reference-link" href="#Uhe--2021">Uhe et al., 2021</a>) and the influence of vegetation responses to elevated CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span> on transpiration (<a class="reference-link" href="#Betts--2015">Betts et al., 2015</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Human factors are projected to be the dominant driver of future water scarcity on a global scale (<a class="reference-link" href="#Graham--2020a">Graham et al., 2020a</a>). However, at regional scales, high uncertainty in climate changes means that reduced water availability is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>more likely than not </span> in many major river basins and remains a risk in most basins even where the central estimate is for increased water availability due to climate change (Figure 4.16). Such substantial uncertainties in projected water scarcity are crucial factors causing water management policies and planning challenges in the future. Therefore, locations projected to see significant increases in water scarcity with large uncertainty can be considered to be subject to the highest challenges for water management policy (Figure Box 4.1.1b; <a class="reference-link" href="#Greve--2018">Greve et al., 2018</a>).</p><div class="Figure mb-0"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_Figure ParaOverride-5" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" id="figure-4-box-4-1-1" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_4_Box_4_1_1.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_Figure_title ParaOverride-6" lang="en-GB"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure Box 4.1.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Geographical distributions of current water scarcity and levels of challenge for policies addressing future change. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_Figure_title_sub ParaOverride-7" lang="en-GB"><span class="figure_number" lang> (a) </span> The number of months per year with severe water scarcity (ratio of water demand to availability &gt; 1.0).

Projections used five CMIP5 climate models, three global hydrological models from ISIMIP and three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Levels of policy challenges refer to the scale and nature of policies to address water scarcity and range from monitoring and reviewing risks (‘low’) through transitional changes in water systems (‘medium’) to transformational changes (‘high’). Low policy challenges arise when the projected water scarcity in 2050 is lower (&lt;0.4), and the level of uncertainty remains relatively stable in future projections. Medium policy challenge arises when either the central estimate of water scarcity remains low but uncertainty increases, or the uncertainty is stable but the central estimate of water scarcity for 2050 is higher (&gt;0.4).

However, relative levels of water security in different places can be compared using metrics representing critical aspects of security (Gain et al., 2016; <a class="reference-link" href="#Young--2019">Young et al., 2019</a>), ideally with thresholds for secure/insecure compared with local experience to assess validity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Young--2019">Young et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Gain et al. (2016) define a Global Water Security Index (GWSI) metric on a scale of 0 to 1 combining indicators of relative levels of availability of freshwater, accessibility to water services, water management and water quality and safety (including flood risk, which can affect water quality as well as being a direct physical hazard). Global application of this index indicates large worldwide differences in water security arising from different combinations of reasons (Figure Box 4.1.2a). In North Africa, the Middle East, large parts of the Indian sub-continent and north China, low water security arises predominantly from low water availability. However, many areas with relatively high water availability have relatively low levels of water security due to other factors. In 2015, 29% of the world’s population did not have access to safe drinking water (Ritchie and Roser, 2019). In large parts of South and Southeast Asia, significant contributions to water insecurity came from increased flood risk and deteriorated water quality (<a class="reference-link" href="#Burgess--2010">Burgess et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ward--2017">Ward et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Farinosi--2018">Farinosi et al., 2018</a>). Water availability is relatively high across most of Africa, but water security is relatively low due to low accessibility, management and safety/quality standards. Most people in Africa do not have access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Marson--2015">Marson and Savin, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Naik--2017">Naik, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Armah--2018">Armah et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">In contrast, some areas with high physical water scarcity, such as some parts of the USA, Australia and southern Europe, show relatively high water security levels due to good governance, safety/quality and accessibility. Nevertheless, marginalised groups such as Indigenous Peoples experience reduced access to water even within regions in the Global North. For example, in both Canada and the USA, many Indigenous Peoples living on reserves lack access to piped water (<a class="reference-link" href="#Collins--2017">Collins et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hanrahan--2017">Hanrahan, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Marshall--2018">Marshall et al., 2018</a>) and (or) are on boil water advisories (<a class="reference-link" href="#Patrick--2019">Patrick et al., 2019</a>).

Nevertheless, climate change poses clear risks to water security in many regions through potential impacts on water availability, quality and flooding. The range of possible outcomes is extremely large, and assessing the likelihood of particular outcomes depends on consideration of uncertain regional climate changes and uncertain socioeconomic futures. Uncertainty in future water scarcity projections makes climate change risks to water security and planning for adaptation challenging. Limiting climate change to lower levels of global warming would reduce the risks to water security arising from climate change, partly because uncertainties in regional climate change are smaller at lower levels of warming.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">In summary, roughly half of the world’s population are assessed as currently subject to severe water scarcity for at least some part of the year due to climatic and non-climatic factors, and this is projected to be exacerbated at higher levels of warming (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>).

Extensive records from weather stations, satellites and radar clearly show that precipitation patterns have shifted worldwide. Three major shifts documented are (a) some regions receiving more annual or seasonal precipitation and others less, (b) many regions have seen increased heavy precipitation, and many have seen either increases or decreases in dry spells and (c) some regions have seen shifts towards heavier precipitation events separated by more prolonged dry spells (<a class="section-link" data-title="Observed Changes in Precipitation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.2.1.1">Section 4.2.1.1</a>). Observationally based calculations suggest that ET has changed in response to changes in precipitation and increasing temperatures, resulting in changing patterns of soil moisture worldwide which are now detectable by satellite remote sensing (Sections 4.2.1.2, 4.2.1.3). Rising temperatures have caused profound and extensive changes in the global cryosphere, with mountain glaciers, land ice and snow cover shrinking, causing substantial, permanent impacts on the ways of life of people in these regions, particularly Indigenous Peoples with strong cultural links to long-term or seasonally frozen environments (Sections 4.2.2, 4.3.8).

Improved preparedness reduced mortality: Heatwave in Europe, 2019</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">In 2019, Europe experienced several record-breaking heatwaves. In June, the first one featured record heat for that time in early summer, with temperatures of 6°C–10°C above normal over most of France and Germany, northern Spain, northern Italy, Switzerland, Austria and the Czech Republic (Climate, 2019). The second heatwave also resulted in all-time records for Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the UK in July. Attribution studies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vautard--2020">Vautard et al., 2020</a>) demonstrated that these would have had extremely small odds in the absence of human-induced climate change or would have been 1.5°C–3°C colder without human-induced climate change. This study concluded that state-of-the-art climate models underestimate the trends in local heat extremes compared to the observed trend. Since the 2003 heatwave, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths across Europe, many European countries have adopted heatwave plans, including early warning systems. Therefore, mortality in 2019 was substantially lower than it might have been. Unfortunately, mortality is not registered systematically across Europe, and therefore, comprehensive analyses are missing. But even based on the countries that provide the numbers, more specifically France, Belgium and the Netherlands, the European heatwave of 2019 resulted in over 2500 deaths (<a class="reference-link" href="#CRED--2019">CRED, 2019</a>).

An attribution study (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kreienkamp--2021">Kreienkamp et al., 2021</a>) focused on the heavy rainfall rather than river discharge and water levels, because sufficient hydrological data was not available, partly because hydrological monitoring systems were destroyed by the event.

These include parts of the Indian sub-continent where at 4°C global warming, the projected changes shift to a consensus on increased precipitation ranging between a few percent to over 70%.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Notably, the multi-model median change in precipitation is relatively small in many regions—less than 10% over most of the global land surface at 1.5°C global warming. In contrast, in many locations, the 5<span class="superscript CharOverride-1" lang>th</span> to 95<span class="superscript CharOverride-1" lang>th</span> percentile range can include changes that are much larger changes than the median and also changes that are relatively large but opposite in sign. At 4°C global warming, the median projected changes are larger, ranging from a 20% decrease to a 40% increase (excluding very dry areas, where percentage changes can be much larger due to very small baseline values), but nevertheless often remain a poor indicator of the range of changes across the ensemble. Therefore, use of the median or mean projected changes for future adaptation decisions could substantially underestimate the risk of large changes in precipitation. It could mean that the risk of the opposite sign of changes is not accounted for. Indeed, for mean precipitation, different multi-model ensembles can show different levels of significance of the central estimate of change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Uhe--2021">Uhe et al., 2021</a>: Figure 4.11a). Consequently, information on the range of possible outcomes can be valued by users for effectively informing risk assessments (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lowe--2018">Lowe et al., 2018</a>).</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer053"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-13" id="figure-4-011" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_4_011.png"></span></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 4.11 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Agreement between different multi-model ensembles on significant changes in (a) annual mean precipitation and (b) annual maximum 1-d precipitation (Rx1day) at 2°C global warming (Uhe et a</span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>l. </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>, 2021). </span>Using central estimates from five ensembles of climate models (CMIP5, CMIP6, HAPPI, HELIX and UKCP18) using different models and different experimental designs for the ensembles, the maps show the number of ensembles for which the central estimate shows a significant drying or wetting change at 2°C global warming relative to pre-industrial levels.

Furthermore, these droughts (hydrological, agricultural and ecological) are often modulated by prevailing soil and hydro-morphological characteristics. Therefore, the choice of drought definition can affect the magnitude and even the sign of the projected drought change.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In a study with multiple climate models, global water models and scenarios, the choice of drought definition was the dominant source of uncertainty in the sign of projected change in drought frequency in over 17% of global land by 2070–2099, including several major wheat- and maize-growing areas where agricultural (soil moisture) drought is of high importance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Satoh--2021">Satoh et al., 2021</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Cook--2020a">Cook et al. (2020a)</a> noted that in the CMIP6 projections, soil moisture and runoff drying are more robust, spatially extensive and severe than precipitation, resulting in the frequency of agricultural drought increasing over wider areas than for meteorological drought. At 1.5°C global warming, the likelihood of extreme agricultural (soil moisture) drought is projected to at least double (100% increase) over large areas of northern South America, the Mediterranean, western China and high latitudes in North America and Eurasia (Figure 4.18, left column). The likelihood is projected to increase by 150–200% in these regions at 2°C global warming, with an expansion of the affected areas, and increase by over 200% at 4°C global warming. Agricultural drought likelihood also increases by 100–250% at 4°C global warming in southwestern North America, southwest Africa, southern Asia and Australia. The likelihood of extreme drought is projected to decrease in central North America, the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, the eastern Indian sub-continent and parts of western and eastern Asia. Using eight global hydrological models driven by a subset of four of the CMIP5 climate models, <a class="reference-link" href="#Lange--2020">Lange et al. (2020)</a> projected a 370% (30–790%) increase of the global population annually exposed to agricultural (soil moisture) droughts in response to 2°C global warming. Therefore, it is essential to consider the drought type when applying drought projections to impact and risk in decision-making, especially for informing adaptation. For example, if responses are explicitly tailored to agricultural (soil moisture) drought changes, projected changes in a meteorological (precipitation) drought metric may not provide accurate information.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Compared to CMIP5, the CMIP6 ensemble projects more consistent drying in the Amazon basin (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parsons--2020">Parsons, 2020</a>), more extensive declines in total soil moisture in Siberia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cook--2020a">Cook et al., 2020a</a>) and stronger declines in westernmost North Africa and southwestern Australia. Projected declines in soil moisture in these geographies would cause a significant risk of agricultural drought. Also, importantly, projected changes in drought in many regions depend on the season and may not be evident in annual mean changes. For example, in northwestern Asia, hydrological (runoff) drought frequency is projected to decrease by 50–100% in autumn and winter but increase by up to 250% in spring and summer (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cook--2020a">Cook et al., 2020a</a>). In contrast, meteorological (precipitation) drought frequency is projected to increase by up to 350% throughout the year.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Drought projections are subject to uncertainties due to limits of predictability and understanding of the relevant biophysical processes. Uncertainties in regional climate changes are significant in many regions (see Figure 4.10, Figure 4.13, Figure 4.15), and in climate model ensembles, the range of regional outcomes generally increases with global warming. This widening of the range of outcomes can contribute to the increased likelihood of extreme droughts across the ensemble as a whole (Figure 4.18, right column). The response of transpiration to elevated CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span> is also a significant uncertainty.

Climate change is projected to further exacerbate many of these risks, especially at warming levels above 1.5°C (Figure 4.20). For some sectors and regions, climate change may also hold the potential for beneficial outcomes, though feedback and cascading effects as well as risks of climate extremes are not always well understood and often underestimated in impact projections. Risks manifest as a consequence of the interplay of human and natural vulnerability, sector-specific exposure as well as the climate hazard as a driver of climate change. Challenges to water security are driven by factors across these components of risk, where climate change is but one facet of driving water insecurity in the face of global change. While the focus of this chapter is on climate change and its effects on water security, for many sectors and regions the dynamics of socioeconomic conditions is a core driver. They play an essential role in understanding and alleviating water security risks. The following sections outline sectoral risks for both, risks driven by water-related impacts, such as drought, flood or changes in water availability, as well as risks with effects on water uses, mainly focusing on changing water demand as a consequence of climate change. It therefore does not cover all climate change-driven risks to the respective sectors, but is limited to those that stand in relation to water. The focus within this chapter is on global to regional processes (additional regional to local information in Table SM4.4; Figure 4.20 as well as across regional chapters of this report).</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer073"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-19" id="figure-4-020" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_4_020.png"></span></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 4.20 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Regional synthesis of changes in water and consequent impacts assessed in this chapter. </span></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title_sub" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang> (a) </span> Regional changes and impacts of selected variables.

Most of these adaptation case studies are from Asia and Africa, and agriculture is the predominant sector where most of these adaptation responses are being implemented (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation in the Agricultural Sector" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.6.2">Section 4.6.2</a>). However, the sectoral nature of adaptation responses varies across continents. Agriculture is the most important sector in all continents, except Europe and Australasia, where most adaptation occurs in the urban sector (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Figure 4.24).</p><div class="Figure" id="_idContainer089"><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-23" id="figure-4-024" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_4_024.png"></span></p><p class="Body_Figures_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure 4.24 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Location of case studies on water-related adaptation which measure adaptation outcomes (</span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang><span class="light_condensed_italic" lang>n</span></span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>= 359) and their sectoral distribution across all regions. </span>Circles denote the number of case studies in a particular location in the continent.

These top four responses provide several benefits such as higher incomes and yields, better water use efficiencies and related outcomes (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Table 4.9 and Figure 4.27). However, those benefits are incremental, that is, they help improve crop production and incomes, at least in the short run, but may not automatically lead to transformative outcomes and climate risk reductions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pelling--2015">Pelling et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fedele--2019">Fedele et al., 2019</a>). One way to move from incremental to transformative adaptation could be to invest gains from incremental adaptation in education and capacity building to improve overall adaptive capacity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vermeulen--2018">Vermeulen et al., 2018</a>). Responses such as migration, including spontaneous and planned relocation, are also relatively well documented (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>), as are responses such as collective action, training and capacity building and economic and financial measures for increasing adaptive capacities (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>). These categories of adaptation can potentially lead to transformative outcomes, such as a shift to livelihoods that are less exposed to climate hazards. However, transformative pathways are not always straightforward (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pahl-Wostl--2020">Pahl-Wostl et al., 2020</a>) (Table 4.8).</p><p class="Body_Tables_Table_title" lang="en-US"><span class="table_number" lang>Table 4.8 | </span>Illustrative examples of case studies of water-related adaptation responses where outcomes were measured (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>n</span>= 359).

Of the 319 case studies where adaptation response was found to have some beneficial outcomes, around one third of them also mentioned the possibility of maladaptation. Migration can often have maladaptive outcomes because migration can exacerbate the inherent vulnerabilities of migrants (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptations Through Human Mobility and Migration" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.6.8">Section 4.6.8</a>). For example, slum dwellers in cities may earn higher incomes, but their quality of life worsens (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ayeb-Karlsson--2016">Ayeb-Karlsson et al., 2016</a>). In some instances, even wage rates in migration hotspots can remain low due to the high volume of the migrant population (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fenton--2017b">Fenton et al., 2017b</a>); as such, it does not help buffer consumption against rainfall shocks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gao--2018">Gao and Mills, 2018</a>). Migration also has gendered impacts, with girls from migrating families being taken out of school (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gioli--2014">Gioli et al., 2014</a>) or interrupting children’s education overall (<a class="reference-link" href="#Warner--2014">Warner and Afifi, 2014</a>).

However, there is limited quantitative information on the future viability of available responses to reduce projected climate impacts effectively. However, the context-specific nature of adaptation on the ground and the uncertainties associated with future climate outcomes, both in terms of policy decisions around mitigation and model-inherent uncertainties, make long-term projections of adaptation effectiveness of limited use for decision-making on the ground. However, such projections are still needed to understand the efficacy of current technical and managerial solutions to reduce climate risk. Consequently, an increasing body of literature focuses on the effectiveness of specific interventions to reduce projected climate risks in a local to regional setting.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This section provides a quantitative aggregate assessment of effectiveness of projected water-related climate adaptations at different levels of GWLs (SM4.2). Effectiveness is defined as the potential of a given adaptation measure to address projected changes in climate and return the system under analysis to baseline conditions. If the measure cannot fully compensate for the projected climate risk, residual risks remain, defined as the fraction of risk remaining after adaptation. For example, in many regions, projected temperature-driven yield loss can be reduced by shifting to or increasing irrigation. However, yields often do not always fully return to baseline conditions without climate change, leaving residual risk after adaptation. Assessed options are limited to technical solutions, which have quantitative entry points to global climate impact models.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Most adaptation projections focus on water-related interventions in the agricultural sector, including irrigation-related responses, shifting planting dates, changing crops and cultivars, and water and soil conservation. Sectoral projections of adaptation effectiveness are limited in forestry- and agroforestry-related responses, flood protection measures (excluding here options that are solely related to effects of sea level rise), urban water-related adaptation and energy-related responses. The majority of assessed studies focus on comparing different variations of one or several response options in terms of timing or duration, for example, a shift in planting dates of 10 d and 20 d, relative to present-day practice and provide results for a range of scenarios and (or) timeframes.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">A total of 45 studies were identified for this assessment, based on their quantitative assessment of the effects of adaptation on projected impacts (SM4.2 for the method of future projected effectiveness assessment). From each study, the distinct combinations of specific variations of adaptations, scenarios and timeframes assessed were considered as individual data points, providing a total of 450 unique data points for the assessment (Table SM4.6). The study-specific temperature increase was classified relative to the 1850–1900 baseline for each data point, based on the model and scenario specifications provided and grouped into outcomes at 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C. The effectiveness is assessed based on the fraction of risk that an option can reduce.

Based on the ability of an implemented option to return the system to its baseline state, the effectiveness is classified based on the share of risk the option can reduce: large (&gt;80%); moderate (80–50%); small (&lt;50–30%); insufficient (&lt;30%). Where the system state is improved relative to baseline, co-benefits are identified. Residual impacts show the share of remaining impacts after adaptation has been implemented: negligible (&lt;5%); small (5 to &lt;20%); moderate (20 to &lt;50); large (≥50%). Where risks increase after adaptation, data points are shown as maladaptation.

As a frequently implemented option with direct entry points to agricultural models, this option provides the most robust set of data points across regions and warming levels. For all regions, a reduction in effectiveness is apparent from 1.5°C to higher levels of warming, leading to increased residual risk with increasing warming (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Irrigation can increase yield relative to present day, showing co-benefits for some regions, though the share of co-benefits decreases with higher warming (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (Figure 4.28). However, since many of these studies rely on global agricultural models which do not fully represent the actual availability of water, further expansion of irrigation at the scale assumed in those studies may not be realistic (Sections 4.3.1.2. 4.3.1.3) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Elliott--2014">Elliott et al., 2014</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">A wide range of water and soil management-related options (Figure 4.28), including mulching, no tilling or contour farming, has been assessed for future effectiveness (eight studies; 49 data points).

Though maladaptive outcomes are also documented, residual risks are limited, also at higher levels of warming. Therefore, developing integrated plans of synergistic options linked to adequate monitoring and evaluation approaches and designed to adjust to changing conditions continuously is desirable to minimise climate risk and ensure food security (<a class="reference-link" href="#Babaeian--2021">Babaeian et al., 2021</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Globally, agroforestry-related adaptation (four studies; 18 data points) is moderately to highly effective, with the potential for substantial co-benefits at 1.5° and 2°C of warming, with a sharp decline in effectiveness at 3°C and 4°C and a substantial increase in residual risk and maladaptive outcomes (Figure 4.28).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Flood risk-related adaptation (four studies; 47 data points) is associated with the potential for substantial co-benefits relative to present-day flood risk, indicating a current adaptation gap larger than for other impact areas.

However, since not all possible future adaptation responses can be incorporated in climate impact models, this is a major limitation to assessing the full scope of options available in the future. For example, many frequently implemented measures showing effective outcomes, such as behavioural and capacity building-focused responses or migration and off-farm diversification (<a class="section-link" data-title="Benefits, Including Co-benefits of Water-related Adaptation Responses and Resulting Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.1.2">Section 4.7.1.2</a>), are not incorporated in quantitative water-related climate impact projection models. In addition, projections of future adaptation depend on currently available technologies or approaches, but new methods and technologies will probably emerge. Thus, improving the representation of adaptation in future projections is a significant knowledge gap that remains to be addressed.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Whether specific adaptation responses are shown to be effective and even lead to co-benefits or are associated with residual impacts is highly contextually, location- and crop-specific. In addition, the specific climate-impact-scenario combinations play an important role in determining assessed outcomes.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In practice, responding to increasing climate risk will need to be context-specific and sufficiently agile to respond to ever-changing realities on the ground. The adaptive pathways approach underline that a sequence of different options responding to climate change over time may be most effective (<a class="reference-link" href="#Babaeian--2021">Babaeian et al., 2021</a>). In addition, impact models generally underestimate or underrepresent climate extremes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schewe--2019">Schewe et al., 2019</a>), limiting the ability of the present analysis to reflect adaptation requirements to extremes, which are likely to push systems to their limits (<a class="section-link" data-title="Limits to Adaptation and Losses and Damages" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.4">Section 4.7.4</a>). While currently known structural adaptation responses can reduce some of the projected risks across sectors and regions, residual impacts remain at all levels of warming, and effectiveness decreases at higher levels of warming. Adaptation generally performs more effectively at 1.5°C, though residual damages are projected at this warming level across sectors and regions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). A range of options also shows the potential for further increasing negative effects (maladaptation) across sectors, regions and warming levels, further underlining the need for contextualised approaches.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="4.7.3"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">4.7.3 Comparing Current and Future Water-Related Adaptation Responses <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-46-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Water-related adaptation is being observed across sectors and regions (<a class="section-link" data-title="Key Risks and Adaptation Responses in Various Water Use Sectors" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.6">Section 4.6</a>), and beneficial outcomes are documented across different dimensions (<a class="section-link" data-title="Current Water-Related Adaptation Responses, Benefits, Co-benefits and Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.1">Section 4.7.1</a>).

However, due to the largely different assessment methodologies for measuring beneficial outcomes for current adaptations and effectiveness to reduce impacts for future adaptations, comparing current and future adaptation outcomes is not straightforward. For current adaptation responses, beneficial outcomes may or may not translate to climate risk reduction, making risk reduction potential of observed adaptation a significant gap in our current understanding. The large diversity of outcomes across regions and assessed options becomes apparent for future adaptation options, with the group of ‘inconclusive’ outcomes indicating a large spread of results across regions.

Effectiveness is defined as the fraction of adaptation that the option is able to reduce; residual risk is the fraction of risk remaining after adaptation.

However, there may be a positive reporting bias in the literature, as positive outcomes are more likely to be reported than negative ones. Also, positive outcome in one parameter does not preclude negative outcomes in others, so maladaptation is still possible even when an adaption has some positive benefits (<a class="section-link" data-title="Benefits, Including Co-benefits of Water-related Adaptation Responses and Resulting Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.1.2">Section 4.7.1.2</a>). In addition, much of the adaptation happening on the ground may not be published in peer-reviewed publications and, therefore, not covered by the literature assessed in this report. Further, there is limited knowledge about the effectiveness of current adaptation in reducing climate-related risks due to documentation and methodological challenges elaborated in <a class="section-link" data-title="Benefits, Including Co-benefits of Water-related Adaptation Responses and Resulting Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.1.2">Section 4.7.1.2</a> (SM4.2).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In contrast, evaluating the effectiveness for future projected adaptations is methodologically possible (<a class="section-link" data-title="Projections of Future Effectiveness of Adaptation Responses" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.2">Section 4.7.2</a>, and SM4.2), but every adaptation that is happening now cannot be modelled for the future. Therefore, projections of future adaptation effectiveness are limited to those options that can be incorporated into (global) quantitative climate impact models. Unfortunately, an extensive range of options, such as capacity building or training, migration and employment, which are essential building blocks in the portfolio of available (water-related) adaptation options, are currently not quantitatively represented in adaptation projections. In addition, the future will probably bring further development in technical solutions, which are currently also not modelled. While implementing the modelled technical options may be feasible in general, several barriers and constraints (<a class="section-link" data-title="Limits to Adaptation and Losses and Damages" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-4#4.7.4">Section 4.7.4</a>) and enabling conditions, which influence adaptation action in practice, are not included in current modelling studies. Therefore, the modelling studies may present optimistic assessments of adaptation effectiveness for the future.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Adaptations that are beneficial now (e.g., crop- and water-related ones) are also projected to be effective to varying extents in reducing future risks, with the degree of effectiveness strongly depending on future GWLs. For example, beyond a certain level of warming (2°C and upwards), the effectiveness of most options is projected to reduce, and residual impacts are projected to increase. Reduction in the effectiveness of future adaptation at higher global warming levels emphasises the need for limiting warming to 1.5°C, as space for adaptation solution starts to shrink beyond that for most options for which future projections exists (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">To sum up, there are two significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of water-related adaptations. First, the nature of literature on current adaptation makes it challenging to infer their effectiveness in reducing climate risks, even though the benefits of adaptation are clear (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Second, not all adaptation responses that are possible in the future can be modelled because of inherent limitations to what can be modelled. Thus, advancement in tools and metrics for measuring the effectiveness of current adaptation in reducing climate risks and suitable downscaled climate and impact models that incorporate economic, social, cultural and management aspects for an extensive range of future adaptation options is needed.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="4.7.4"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">4.7.4 Limits to Adaptation and Losses and Damages <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-47-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The core constraints identified in AR5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Klein--2014">Klein et al., 2014</a>) for freshwater-related adaptation were lack of governance, financial resources and information, while water availability was singled out as a core constraint to diversifying options for water-dependent sectors.

Water security is multi-dimensional and not just about water availability. Water needs to be available in sufficient quantity and quality and needs to be accessible in an acceptable form. Accordingly, a situation of water security indicates the availability and accessibility of sufficient clean water to allow a population to sustainably ensure its livelihoods, health, socioeconomic development and political stability. Many socioeconomic factors, such as population growth and food consumption patterns, play an important role in determining water security. Still, climate change is increasingly shown to be an important contributor to water insecurity worldwide, with some regions more at risk than others. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Climate change can affect these different dimensions of water security in different ways. Most directly, climate change is affecting the overall availability of water across regions and during important seasons. More extended periods of dry spells and droughts are already affecting water availability, especially in the arid areas of India, China, the USA and Africa. Other extremes, such as heavy precipitation and flooding, can affect water quality, making water unsafe for drinking, for example. In coastal regions and small islands, the combined effects of higher sea levels and more intense storms affect water security by increasing the salinisation of groundwater resources. Indirect effects of climate change on water security include impacts on infrastructure for the provision and recovery of water resources, which can affect the safe access to adequate water resources, both in terms of quality and quantity.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">In terms of assessing the extent of water scarcity, studies estimate that currently, between 1.5 and 2.5 billion people live within areas exposed to water scarcity globally. These numbers are projected to increase continuously, with estimates of up to 3 billion at 2°C and up to 4 billion at 4°C by 2050. Many socioeconomic factors, such as population growth and food consumption patterns, determine water scarcity. Still, climate is increasingly shown to be an important component that drives scarcity across the world. Water scarcity is often a seasonal occurrence, and climate change is projected to increase seasonal extremes. Often, consecutive years with drier conditions lead to a long-term decrease in groundwater tables, affecting water availability directly and soil moisture in the longer term.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">As an essential component of water security, climate change will affect water quality in different ways. Drier conditions lead to a reduction in water availability, causing a potential increase in the concentration of contaminants. Increasing runoff and floods can wash pollutants into water bodies. With climate change projected to increase the variability of rain over space and time, such impacts on water quality are becoming increasingly likely . Higher temperatures add to deteriorating water quality by reducing oxygen levels.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Another critical component to ensure secure access to water resources is adequate water infrastructure for access, disposal and sanitation. Unfortunately, increasing extremes due to climate change, especially floods and increasing storm activity, have great potential to damage such infrastructure, especially in developing world regions, where infrastructure is much more susceptible to damage and pollution.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">There are substantial differences in the distribution of risks across regions, with some areas facing a much higher risk burden than others.

Approximately 600 million people live in places with longer dry spells than in the 1950s, mostly in West Africa, south Asia and parts of South America. Approximately 360 million people experience shorter dry spells, in North America, northern Asia and other parts of South America.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">In contrast, far more people (about 600 million people) are seeing heavier precipitation than less heavy precipitation (80 million).

The impact of floods and droughts are expected to increase across all economic sectors, resulting in negative outcomes for the global production of goods and services, industry output, employment, trade and household consumption. Floods will pose additional risks to people’s lives and health through inundation, facilitating the further spread of waterborne diseases. At the same time, droughts can have adverse health impacts due to the limited availability of food and water for drinking and hygienic purposes.

However, the location and severity of floods and droughts are context-dependent and complex phenomena.</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-2"><div class="FAQ-Box_Header-continued" id="_idContainer112"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_continued-prev-page ParaOverride-6" lang="en-US">FAQ 4.3</p></div></div><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The processes that lead to droughts include lack of or less frequent precipitation, increased evapotranspiration and decreased soil moisture, snow cover, runoff and streamflow. For example, warming temperatures may result in higher evapotranspiration, in turn leading to drier soils. In addition, reduced soil moisture diminishes the amount of water filtering into rivers in both the short and long term while also increasing the aridity that can foster the conditions for fire. Moreover, decreased snow cover represents less runoff supply to downstream areas during warmer seasons. Depending on this process and the propagation of a meteorological drought onto further systems, a drought can be defined as hydrological, agricultural or ecological. Agricultural drought threatens food production through crop damage and yield decreases, and consequent economic impacts, and therefore, can be the most impactful to humans. Geographically, the likelihood of agricultural drought is projected to increase across most of southern Africa, Australia, the majority of Europe, the southern and western USA, Central America and the Caribbean, northwest China, parts of South America, and the Russian Federation; but due to increased precipitation, it is projected to decline in southeastern South America, central Africa, central Canada, western India and the south of the Arabian Peninsula.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Flood hazard natural processes usually result from increases in heavy precipitation events, but they can also be caused by saturated soils, increased runoff and land use changes. A warming climate usually causes greater energy for the intense upward motion for storm formation and increases evapotranspiration, which leads to heavier precipitation. Many places around the world will experience more-than-average rainfall, which may increase soil moisture. Wetter soils saturate faster during precipitation events, resulting in increased runoff that can muddy the waters and lead to floods. Anthropogenic land use changes, such as urbanisation, deforestation, grasslands and agricultural extension, can also reduce the amount of water infiltrating the soil and leading to frequent flooding. Floods are expected to increase in Asia, the USA and Europe, particularly in areas dependent on glacier water where melting will lead to earlier spring floods. Additionally, fluvial floods are projected to be more frequent in some regions in central Africa and northern high latitudes and less frequent in the southern areas of North America, southern South America, the Mediterranean, parts of Australia and southern parts of Europe.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Globally, socioeconomic development will lead to heightened societal hazards. Due to population growth and increased urbanisation, floods and droughts will affect more people in the course of this century, especially if warming cannot be limited to 1.5°C. All losses, both in lives and in economic terms, will be more limited in a 1.5°C than in a 3°C warmer world. The impacts of floods and droughts are expected to increase across all economic sectors, from agriculture to energy production, resulting in negative outcomes for our global production of goods and services, industry output, employment, trade and household consumption. Landslides, sinkholes and avalanches arising from heavy rainfall events will increasingly threaten infrastructure and agricultural production. In cities, increased flood frequency could disrupt waste management systems, resulting in the clogging of waterways. In addition, unprecedented flood magnitudes could overwhelm hydraulic infrastructure, affecting the energy, industry and transportation sectors. An expansion in inundation area, coupled with urban sprawl, would increase flood damage. Floods will pose additional risks to people’s lives and health through inundation, thus facilitating the spread of waterborne diseases. At the same time, drought can have adverse health impacts due to the limited availability of food and water for drinking and hygienic purposes. Although there are no agreed-upon projections for migration and displacement due to water-related disasters, it is known that drought and desertification cause harvest failures, which may lead subsistence farmers to relocate to urban areas. Whether temporary or permanent, displacement is often mired with diminished safety, loss of social ties, and a weakened sense of place and cultural identity.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Finally, vulnerable groups such as people living in poverty, women, children, Indigenous Peoples, uninsured workers and the elderly will be the most affected by water-related disasters.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 4.4"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 4.4 | Globally, agriculture is the largest user of water. How will climate change impact this sector, and how can farmers adapt to these changes?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-69-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Climate-induced changes in the global hydrological cycle are already impacting agriculture through floods, droughts and increased rainfall variability, which have affected yields of major crops such as maize, soybeans, rice and wheat. These changes are projected to continue in a warmer world, which will cause yields of rain-fed crops to decline and reduce the amount of water available for irrigation in water-stressed regions. Farmers already use adaptation and coping strategies to manage agricultural water use. Some of the most important adaptation responses are the application of irrigation, on-farm water and soil conservation; changing cropping patterns; adopting improved cultivars; and improved agronomic practices. In many parts of the world, farmers increasingly use Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge to inform their decisions of what to grow, when to grow and how much to irrigate. To offset the risks of market-related volatility coupled with climate change, farmers also adopt economic and financial instruments such as index-based crop insurance. Training and capacity-building programmes and social safety nets are other forms of adaptation that farmers are using to respond to these changes. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Worldwide, and especially in developing countries, agriculture (including crop cultivation and livestock and fisheries) is the largest water user, accounting for 50–90% of all water use. Moreover, a substantial part of the water used in agriculture is ‘consumptive’ use, which means that the water is ‘consumed’ for crop growth and is not immediately available for other uses. This is different from other sectors, such as energy production, where only a fraction of the water is consumed, and other downstream users can reuse the rest. Agriculture also accounts for a large share of employment in developing countries, with 60–80% of the rural population dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. Agriculture provides food security for all. This makes farmers and agriculture particularly vulnerable to climate change.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Climate-induced changes in the global hydrological cycle are already impacting agriculture through floods, droughts and increased rainfall variability. For example, loss in yields has been reported for major crops such as maize (by 4.1%), soybeans (by 4.5%), rice (by 1.8%) and wheat (by 1.8%) due to changes in precipitation between 1981 and 2010. In addition, drought has affected both the area under cultivation and the yields of major crops. According to one estimate, globally, there has been a loss of 9–10% of total cereal production due to droughts and other weather extremes. Similarly, floods are one of the significant reasons for crop losses worldwide. Climate change-induced losses in livestock and fisheries have also been documented. In some parts of the world, especially in cold temperate zones, agro-climatic zones have become more conducive to yield growth in crops like maize and soybean due to increases in summer precipitation. Yet, negative impacts far outweigh positive impacts.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Projected impacts on agriculture due to changes in water availability are also severe. For example, yields of rain-fed crops such as maize are projected to decline by one fifth to one third by the end of the century. In contrast, many areas which currently support multiple crops may become unsuitable for rain-fed farming or support only one crop in a year. Irrigation, which is often one of the most effective adaptive strategies against water-induced stress, is also projected to be affected by a reduction of the amount of water available for irrigation in some parts of the world that are already water-stressed or as a result of groundwater depletion in places such as India, North China and the northwestern USA. Overall, future droughts and floods will pose a major risk to food security, and agriculture and impacts will be more severe on countries and communities that are already food insecure.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Given that farmers are already dealing with variability in the amount and timing of rainfall.

Some of the most popular adaptation responses around crops and water include:</p><ul><li class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_List_unnumbered" lang="en-US">changing cropping patterns to less water-intensive crops, and changes in the timing of sowing and harvesting to respond to unfamiliar trends in the onset of rains</li><li class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_List_unnumbered" lang="en-US">adoption of improved cultivars, such as drought and flood-resistant seed varieties</li><li class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_List_unnumbered" lang="en-US">improved agronomic practices, including conservation agriculture that helps reduce water application rates</li><li class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_List_unnumbered" lang="en-US">irrigation and water-saving technologies such as efficient irrigation and on-farm water management techniques</li><li class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_List_unnumbered-last" lang="en-US">on-farm water and soil moisture conservation</li></ul><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Most of these measures are beneficial across multiple indicators (water saving, increased incomes, etc.); however, whether they also reduce climate-related risks is not well understood and remains a knowledge gap. Irrigation and changes in crop choices and cultivars are also shown to be effective for future adaptation, especially at 1.5°C global warming, but much less effective at 2°C and 3°C when these responses will not mitigate a large part of the climate risk. Most of these adaptation measures mentioned above are autonomous. However, some, such as improved seeds and cultivars, are supported by national agricultural research agencies, international research coalitions such as the CGIAR [Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research], and private seed companies. In many parts of the world, farmers are also increasingly using IKLK to inform these decisions of what to grow, when to grow and how much to irrigate.</p><div class="Figure"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure ParaOverride-4" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-33" id="figure-4-faq-4.4.1" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_4_FAQ_4_4_1.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure FAQ4.4.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Water-related adaptation responses in agriculture sector: benefits, co-benefits with mitigation, and possible maladaptation</span></p></div><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Given the predominance of market economies worldwide, most farmers also depend on the market to sell their produce, and market fluctuations affect their incomes. In addition, market-related volatility coupled with climate change is a source of increased risk for farmers. Several economic and financial instruments are being used with varying levels of success to offset some of these interlinked impacts. Index-based crop insurance is one such instrument that compensates farmers for losing crops due to hazards such as floods and droughts. However, several limitations in their implementation remain.</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-2"><div class="FAQ-Box_Header-continued" id="_idContainer116"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_continued-prev-page ParaOverride-6" lang="en-US">FAQ 4.4</p></div></div><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">In cases of severe droughts and floods, which have debilitating impacts on already poor and vulnerable populations, national governments provide social safety programmes, such as food or cash-for-work programmes, which are shown to be successful in reducing risks for the most vulnerable people, even though there are often concerns with targeting efficiency. Providing training and capacity building of farmers to adopt new farming practices and technologies to manage risk better are also known to be effective when the training is conceptualised, targeted and implemented in consultation with farmers. Planned adaptation practices include managing weather and market risks through insurance products, social safety nets for vulnerable populations, and providing the right mix of training and capacity building. These adaptation practices are generally implemented by civil society, governments and the private sector.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 4.5"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 4.5 | Which principles can communities implement to sustainably adapt to the ways that climate change is impacting their water security?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-70-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>For communities to sustainably adapt to climate impacts on water security, their participation, cooperation and bottom-up engagement are critical in all stages of decision-making processes. In addition to enhancing the legitimacy of the decision-making process, the community’s involvement can increase the equitability and effectiveness of the adaptation approach. As water insecurity disproportionately affects marginalised social groups, their participation in water governance and implementation can help improve their water security. Combining and integrating local, indigenous and traditional ecological knowledge with Western understandings of climate change can enhance the effectiveness of adaptation measures and strategies while ensuring that the adaptation is equitable and just. Improving water security is fundamental to achieving many of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">For decades, communities worldwide have already been adapting to climate change-induced hydrological changes to maintain their livelihood and safety. Adaptation is a multi-faceted process that is implemented differently depending on the sector affected by changes in the hydrological cycle and the region where these changes happen. For instance, farmers in the semiarid areas might adapt to changing rain patterns through irrigation (see also FAQ4.4). At the same time, urban dwellers can adopt measures such as rainwater harvesting and other nature-based solutions. Several principles have been documented as crucial for achieving sustainable adaptation as they support communities in becoming more resilient to climate change. However, these principles can be implemented singularly or in tandem, and it is essential to acknowledge that long-term adaptation success is context-specific. Therefore, it is critical to involve local communities in co-designing effective adaptation responses.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">For communities to sustainably adapt to climate impacts on water security, participation, cooperation and bottom-up engagement are critical in all stages of the decision-making processes, from planning to full implementation. Many of the countries and social groups most threatened by climate change have contributed least to global warming and do not have access to adequate resources to adapt. Effective participation of these actors in water-related climate change adaptation planning can contribute to more equitable adaptation actions. The involvement of the most vulnerable in the design of adaptation responses makes it more probable that these solutions will suit their needs and have therefore a higher chance of being effective. Accessible, inclusive and well-coordinated efforts to enhance water security will improve the legitimacy of water governance and work synergistically with reducing inequalities (UN SDG, SDG 10) and encouraging more sustainable communities (SDG 11). Communities can also be involved in sector-specific adaptation responses. These are often water-related and help ensure that climate action (SDG 13) is well aligned with clean water and sanitation (SGD 6).</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The participation of traditionally excluded groups such as women and marginalised communities and Indigenous Peoples and ethnic minorities contributes to more equitable and socially just adaptation actions. Water insecurity disproportionately affects these marginalised groups, and their participation in water governance and implementation can help alleviate this burden.</p><div class="_idGenObjectLayout-2"><div class="FAQ-Box_Header-continued" id="_idContainer118"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_continued-prev-page ParaOverride-6" lang="en-US">FAQ 4.5</p></div></div><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Recognising the importance of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge in improving water security is vital to ensuring that decisions and solutions align with the interests of Indigenous Peoples and local peoples and benefit their communities culturally and economically. Furthermore, the effectiveness of adaptation measures and strategies improves when Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge and traditional ecological knowledge are combined and integrated with technical understandings of climate change.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The climate adaptation plans led by national governments and local authorities will only be accepted and adequately implemented when supported by the community. Therefore, strong political and societal support is necessary to ensure effective policy changes, whether local or national. Significantly, access to financial assistance from private and public sources expands the range of strategies that communities can consider for enhancing their water security.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">These principles are also conducive to the achievement of the United Nations SDGs. Actions that reduce climate risk and enhance water security can positively interact with sustainable development objectives (synergies). Therefore, improving water security is fundamental to achieving many of the 17 SDGs.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_References_head" lang="en-GB"><span>References</span> </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-10-siblings"><p class="References_References_body" id="Abbas--2018" lang="en-GB">Abbas, A., et al., 2018: Sustainable survival under climatic extremes: linking flood risk mitigation and coping with flood damages in rural Pakistan. <span class="condensed_italic" lang>Environ.
