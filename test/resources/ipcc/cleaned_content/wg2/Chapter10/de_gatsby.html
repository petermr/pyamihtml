The self-sufficiency rate of coal will be maintained at a level of 80%, while that of oil and natural gas will decline significantly. The additional oil imports of the emerging Asian economies will be from North America, the Middle East and North Africa. The main players in Asia for the liquefied natural gas imports will extend from Japan and Republic of Korea to China and India.

Much more qualitative research on farmers’ perceptions and decision-making processes about adaptation practices is needed in order to capture their location-specific priorities and get a diverse understanding of the risks and threats. A study of Vietnamese smallholder farmers’ perceptions of their current and future capacity to adapt to climate change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Phuong--2018a">Phuong et al., 2018a</a>) found considerable differences between farmers in crop production and livestock production in terms of their motives behind adopting particular planned adaptation options.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">A study on farmers’ awareness of, and adaptation to, climate change in the dry zones of Myanmar, critically dependent on agriculture, indicates how those at the front line of the adverse effects of climate change are steadily abandoning the common sesame/groundnut cropping pattern, and trying to adapt to risks and uncertainties with the aid of conventional agricultural practices such as rainwater collection, water-harvesting techniques and even traditional weather forecasting techniques for weather prediction. Similarly, a case study of the Gandak basin in Nepal showed that incorporation of local knowledge into agricultural practices and weather warning systems works best when coupled with multiple sources of information based on a method of triangulation.

Correspondingly, this category achieved higher levels of income and food security. The climate-development nexus suggests that CCA practices at the farm level can have significant development outcomes, besides reducing risk posed by changing weather patterns.

The promise of diversification of livestock animals (within species), crop diversification and transition to mixed crop–livestock systems needs to be further explored. A study of livestock farmers in Pakistan showed that risk-coping mechanisms, such as purchasing livestock insurance and increasing land areas for fodder, are far more rewarding policy options in comparison with selling livestock and migrating to another place. Relatedly, the association of migration with adaptation measures is context specific and involves a number of factors pertaining to the socioeconomic circumstances of vulnerable agricultural groups in countries like India and Bangladesh (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ojha--2014">Ojha et al., 2014</a>).

In Myanmar, the lack of adequate agricultural extension strategies has had a negative impact on adaptation outcomes in what is labelled the ‘central dry zone’.

Carefully developed partnerships between government organisations and NGOs can come to the rescue of poor farmers and their precarious households by providing information about best practices for local adaptation strategies, including credit options with various institutions and creating an enabling environment for the promotion of agro-based industries. A study in community forestry in the Indian Himalayan region (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gupta--2019">Gupta and Koontz, 2019</a>) has shown how the synergies and successful partnerships could evolve between government and NGOs in local forest governance, with the former providing technical and financial support, and the latter directing the communities to those resources, and in the making up for each other’s limitations thereby enabling and augmenting community efforts in forest governance.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">A study of Pakistan (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ali--2017">Ali and Erenstein, 2017</a>) shows that factors such as enhanced awareness about various climate risk-coping strategies, better education and agricultural extension services, augmenting farm-household assets, lowering the cost of adaptation, improving access to services and alternative livelihoods, and providing support to poorer households appear to have paid rich dividends.

The issue of how forest governance institutions are conceived and managed, both at national and subnational levels, involving state, private sector and civil society, also needs serious attention (<a class="reference-link" href="#Agung--2014">Agung et al., 2014</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In an example from Nepal, <a class="reference-link" href="#Clement--2018">Clement (2018)</a> showed that deliberative governance mechanisms can create the space for alternative framings of climate change to take a hold in ways that are cognisant of both the local and global contexts; this moves beyond a dependence on techno-managerialism in the construction of solutions, where local governance solutions can support institutional changes. The possibilities more incorporating deliberative methods into wider governance architecture are also expanded through an acknowledgment of the role of social learning; this is observable in the multi-stakeholder involvement that this approach fosters in regions of South Asia such as the Brahmaputra River basin (<a class="reference-link" href="#Varma--2018">Varma and Hazarika, 2018</a>).

This is observable in the structure of the New Urban Agenda which formed part of the SDGs pertaining to cities and has been shaped by a bottom-up process marked by diverse participation including communities, experts and activists, rather than the top-down variant that is observable in the Millenium Development Goals (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barnett--2016">Barnett and Parnell, 2016</a>). This approach could also be evidenced in the Paris Agreement, which placed the onus of a successful global governance regime on the development of efficient systems of regional governance. However, these emerging systems of regional governance could equally pose a challenge to the global governance in a way that can be witnessed through the development of financial groups such as the BRICS (associated economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which resulted from a perception of inadequate institutional transformation at the global level. From another perspective, a comprehensive approach would require simultaneous implementation of both bottom-up and top-down models of governance, retaining flexibility of scale.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Given the concerns surrounding food security, especially in light of the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities, under the NDCs submitted by South Asian nations under the Paris Agreement, emission reduction commitments are <span class="condensed_italic" lang>less likely </span> to include the agriculture sector.

In view of threats posed to coastal ecological integrity by climate-change-induced tropical storm activity, accelerated SLR and littoral erosion and social–ecological impacts on the livelihood security of vulnerable coastal communities, the pressing need for approaches that innovatively combine coastal zone management and CCA measures is widely acknowledged (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rosendo--2018">Rosendo et al., 2018</a>) yet under researched. A study focusing on the three coastal cities of Xiamen, Quanzhou and Dongying, in China, a country with nearly 12% of its national coastline already covered under the ICM governance framework, suggests that whereas the ICM approach has been found to be effective in promoting the overall sustainability of China’s coastal cities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ye--2015">Ye et al., 2015</a>) using accurate and reliable data, in addition, the developing unified standards could usefully reveal changing conditions and parameters related to ICM performance.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Steadily the regional scale of climate adaptive governance is acquiring salience in diverse sub-regions of Asia, and more policy-oriented empirical research is needed on how various regional forums, agencies and multilateral organisations could further contribute by way of in-house expertise and other resources, including financial.

An example from the Maldives shows that the 2014 Tsunami, climate change and the risk of extreme weather events have led to the legitimisation of state-led population resettlement programmes. In China, this has occurred through the renaming of previously existing resettlement initiatives as climate adaptation initiatives; however, the efficacy of resettlement as a CCA measure requires further scrutiny (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arnall--2019">Arnall, 2019</a>). In India, the National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change has been instituted in order to enable states to implement adaptation programmes; however, this does not address the question of mainstreaming CCA into designs for development (<a class="reference-link" href="#Prasad--2019">Prasad and Sud, 2019</a>). This is closely related to the development of National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) where the mainstreaming of adaptation within countries has been an important concern. Insights from developing countries indicate that there is still much ground to cover. The NAPA of the Maldives prioritises food security, coastal resources and public health, while Nepal has prioritised ecosystem management and public health, and food security, among other concerns (<a class="reference-link" href="#Saito--2013">Saito, 2013</a>).

The former pertains to farmers who rely on the support of the cooperative for agricultural support and follow institutional mechanisms. The latter pertains to non-co-op farmers who have been responsible for innovative practices of cultivation such as the shift to peaches and the sale in the market of apples without leaf-picking. Importantly, the non-co-op group also have access to sales channels that may not be accessible to the former owing to their direct interactions with customers, among other factors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fujisawa--2011">Fujisawa and Kobayashi, 2011</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fujisawa--2015">Fujisawa et al., 2015</a>). The significance of this combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches to agricultural adaptation practices may be further sharpened by formulating approaches for Asia and the Pacific region in ways that contribute to the fortification of food security objectives and the idea of co-benefits.

The integration of CCA into the dissemination of localised climatic information and its uptake and implementation through institutional policy arrangements remain areas of concern (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cuevas--2018">Cuevas, 2018</a>). Institutional incentives to agricultural production, for instance, are frequently compounded by the negative impacts they have on existing bases of natural resources.

One possible way of addressing these intersecting sources’ complexity is by locating emerging CCA measures in educational development. The introduction of CCA thinking into land-use planning in the Philippines is an example of the successful role of enhancing public education and awareness through the dissemination of information by institutional channels.

However, a closer examination of the educational imperatives that drive CCA in ways that improve the representational architecture of adaptation actions through a focus on gender is needed. Mainstreaming of gender into CCA would involve addressing a host of barriers to education and involvement that are often rooted in the differential structures of households, social norms and roles, and the domestic division of labour (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rao--2019">Rao et al., 2019</a>).

Even within wider female farmer-operated federations, such as the Bangladesh Kishani Sabha (BKS), the barriers to participation stem from social factors that include the limitation of female mobility through the gendered division of labour and a lack of recognition of female agency (<a class="reference-link" href="#Routledge--2015">Routledge, 2015</a>). Gendered inequalities in educational attainment and outcomes viewed through the lens of social vulnerability thus intersect with environmental vulnerabilities in ways that affect the ability of women to participate in CCA, owing also to a lack of access to health and sanitation facilities. These factors have a direct impact on the ability of adaptation to be effective in the global South, and are especially important in the context of the commitments of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women countries to the objective of gender equality (<a class="reference-link" href="#Roy--2018">Roy, 2018</a>).</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-10.5"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 10.5 | Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100</span><span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-25-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>The Bangladesh Delta Plan</span> (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>BDP</span>)<span class="condensed_italic" lang>2100 is the plan moving Bangladesh forward for the next 100 years.

These sensors range from large optical–thermal–radar satellite instruments with (near) global coverage–for example, Landsat (US Geological Service), Sentinel (European Space Agency), ALOS (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and MethaneSAT–to portable sensors embedded in mobile phones (e.g., phone cameras or temperature sensors) whose data are collected into centralised databases through crowdsourcing (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fenner--2017">Fenner et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Meier--2017">Meier et al., 2017</a>).

Thanks to advances in cloud-computing technology, which allows for online processing of massive volumes of remote sensing data, high-resolution (~30 m) global urban-area maps from the late 1990s to 2018 are now available from several different sources (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gong--2020">Gong et al., 2020</a>). Using these historical maps, researchers have been able to generate maps of future urban land-use changes at the global level to 2100 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2020a">Chen et al., 2020a</a>), which can help to elucidate the potential impacts of this future urban expansion and identify adaptation needs. Technology also plays a major role in urban planning and design in the context of adaptation. To mitigate rising urban temperatures and reduce the impacts of climate-related hazards, many new ‘grey’ infrastructure and ‘green’ infrastructure technologies are being adopted in urban areas in Asia, for example, cool (i.e., high solar reflectance) rooftops and pavements as well as green (i.e., vegetated) rooftops to mitigate high temperatures; and porous pavements to mitigate flooding (<a class="reference-link" href="#Akbari--2016">Akbari and Kolokotsa, 2016</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h4-container" id="10.5.2.2.3"><h4 class="Headings_H4" lang="de-DE">10.5.2.2.3 Water and agriculture <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h4><div class="h4-siblings" id="h4-27-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The majority of the Asian region is experiencing water stress in terms of both quantity and quality, due to poor management systems and governance. This has dire consequences for the national GDP as the majority of the population belongs to agrarian communities and their water-dependent agriculture system. Despite a substantial investment and progress in research and development, and capacity building in the recent past, the majority of developing countries in Asia are struggling to manage both water resources and agriculture sectors heavily <span class="condensed_italic" lang>dependent </span> on water resources, in response to rapid global changes. Considering the frequent extreme weather conditions, progress in management tasks is even more consequential; hence, critically important for these countries, to achieve better CCA, are advanced science and technology viz. smart agriculture, robust EWS using downscaled meteorological information, a participatory approach, IWRM and so forth.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Having scientific knowledge relevant at the local scale through placed knowledge is important to identify climate-change risk and vulnerability. Moreover, once integrated with socioeconomic attributes, it can be useful for natural resource management, agriculture and so forth (<a class="reference-link" href="#Leith--2017">Leith and Vanclay, 2017</a>). Role of big data and data mining is undeniably very huge to get reliable climatic information and hence for designing appropriate adaptation measures for natural resource measurement. For example, use of big data in terms of EWS and real-time observation data provides more accurate information on hydro-meteorological extreme weather conditions or hazards like drought and flood, and will help farmers and local governments to improve their perception and hence preparedness for better adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hou--2017">Hou et al., 2017</a>; Ong and G.L.B.L., 2017). Using big data, different adaptation measures, such as new cultivar breeding, cropping-region adjustment, irrigation-pattern change, crop rotation and cropping-practice optimisation, are being designed in the agriculture sector, and these practices have greatly increased crop yield, leading to higher resource-use efficiency as well as greatly increased soil organic carbon content with reduced GHG emissions. It results in a win–win situation in terms of enhancing food security and mitigating climate warming (<a class="reference-link" href="#Deng--2017">Deng et al., 2017</a>). However, usability and application of this technology are still not common, especially in data-scarce regions. Integrated numerical simulations are efficient tools for estimating the current status and predicting the risk and efficiency of the adaptive capabilities of different countermeasures for sustainable natural resource management such as with water (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kumar--2019">Kumar, 2019</a>). Similarly, the agent-based model is commonly used to estimate risk of food-borne diseases due to climate change, using tunable parameters such as hygiene level, the microorganism’s growth rate and the number of consumers, and hence it has the potential to be a useful tool for optimising decision making and urban planning strategies related to health and climate change (Gay <a class="reference-link" href="#Garcia--2017">Garcia et al., 2017</a>). The integrated assessment model under the shared-socioeconomic pathway (SSP) framework is effectively used to estimate future energy development and possible mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions related to the energy sector (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bauer--2017">Bauer et al., 2017</a>). Sound understanding of different drivers, pressures and stress factors, such as abnormal temperature, rainfall, insect pests or pathogens and their interaction pattern with the genetic makeup of crops, is the key to produce high-yielding varieties of wheat with better nutritional quality and resistance to major diseases (<a class="reference-link" href="#Goel--2017">Goel et al., 2017</a>). Another critical point to address this water security is inclusive, polycentric and adaptive governance. Polycentric governance is a means by which water management plans and policies should be framed and agreed by all relevant stakeholders. For adaptive governance, more emphasis will be on finding the best pathways to make robust water management plans amid rapid global changes. The benefit of such plans should reach the end users in terms of providing clean water, protection from hydrological hazards and maintaining the health of the ecosystem. In addition, there is urgent need for co-management, which includes the cycle of co-design, co-implementation and co-delivery throughout the whole water cycle. The best suitable example is using the circulating and ecological sphere (CES) approach. The CES is a concept that complements and supports regional resources by building broader networks, which are composed of natural connections (connections among forests; city and countryside; groundwater, rivers and the sea) and economic connections (human resources, funds and others), thus complementing each other and generating synergy (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mavrodieva--2020">Mavrodieva and Shaw, 2020</a>). Another suitable example for managing water resources is the participatory watershed land-use management (PWLM) approach. The PWLM is another very innovative and successful approach for more robust water resource management as explained by <a class="reference-link" href="#Kumar--2020">Kumar et al. (2020)</a>. It helps to make land-use and CCA policies more effective at the local scale. This is an integrative method using both participating tactics and computer-simulation modelling for water resource management at the regional scale.</p></div></div><div class="h4-container" id="10.5.2.2.4"><h4 class="Headings_H4" lang="de-DE">10.5.2.2.4 Forests and biodiversity <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h4><div class="h4-siblings" id="h4-28-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Technologies and their applications to identify habitat degradation, ecosystem functions and biodiversity conservation are increasing in Asia, with many countries looking to new and improved means for forest and biodiversity monitoring and conservation. In particular, there has been an impressive use of temporal satellite data, particularly from the Landsat and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) series for widespread monitoring of forests and ecological resources. These series have provided reliable information on forests and ecosystem services at the country level, in difficult terrains, such as the mountains, cross-boundaries and otherwise inaccessible areas. For instance, <a class="reference-link" href="#Yin--2017">Yin et al. (2017)</a> estimated cross-boundary forest resources in Central Asia, a region which traditionally suffered from lack of reliable forest data, using remote sensing techniques. In a separate study, <a class="reference-link" href="#Reddy--2020">Reddy et al. (2020)</a> used long-term MODIS forest fire data from 2003 to 2017 to characterise fire frequency, density and hotspots in South Asia. Archives of scientific data, backed by state-of-the art modelling techniques, advanced-computing methods and innovations in big-data analysis, particularly helped the provisioning of scientific research. A number of studies simulated forest futures from the local to the continent scale under different socioeconomic and climate scenarios. For instance, at the local scale, Dasgupta et al. (2018) projected the future extent of mangroves in the Sundarban Delta under four local scenarios, while <a class="reference-link" href="#Estoque--2019">Estoque et al. (2019)</a> modelled and developed spatial maps of regional forest futures in Southeast Asia using the five SSP scenarios. Science and technology also helped the monitoring of species diversity and abundance, pivotal for sustaining an ecosystem and ecosystem-based adaptation. Digital camera traps and radio-collaring methods have largely replaced old film cameras and labour-intensive methods of photo screening to count target species (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pimm--2015">Pimm et al., 2015</a>). This enhanced scientific capacities to monitor biodiversity and facilitate better conservation in difficult terrains, control poachers and maintain steady ecological balance. <a class="reference-link" href="#Umapathy--2016">Umapathy et al.

To resolve such problems, the enhancement of information science is essential to understand design, implementation and adoption of digital tools under crisis (<a class="reference-link" href="#Xie--2020">Xie et al., 2020</a>). For example, social media research reveals a way of controlling malicious information (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tanaka--2014">Tanaka et al., 2014</a>), and its characteristics under COVID-19–showing a plain text message–can be more powerful in the context of citizen engagement than media-rich communications (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2020b">Chen et al., 2020b</a>). Information behaviour needs more investigation to understand how people survive and connect in the era of information overload (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pan--2020">Pan et al., 2020</a>). Moreover, a new set of data (e.g., travel history record, personal health data, etc.) becomes an important base of DRR (<a class="reference-link" href="#Xie--2020">Xie et al., 2020</a>). Analysis of these personal data requires careful consideration, as it generates ethical issues (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sakurai--2020">Sakurai and Chughtai, 2020</a>).

Despite substantial investment and progress in research, development and capacity building in the recent past, the majority of the developing countries in Asia are struggling to manage both water resources and the agriculture sector. Considering the frequent extreme weather conditions, progress in management tasks has become even more mammoth and, hence, we need a holistic solution, which is currently missing in field implementation.

Despite the importance, the research on adaptation costs is limited in Asia, especially on the economy-wide costs, while fragmented literature is available on sector-level adaptation costs. Most of the available literature on adaptation costs at the regional level originate from the work carried out by development finance institutions such as ADB.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Estimates suggest that climate-change impacts could result in a loss of 2% of the GDP of South Asian countries by 2050 and 9% by 2100 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ahmed--2014">Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014</a>). These impacts will be felt in major vulnerable sectors, including agriculture, water, coastal, marine, health and energy, and will have significant impact on the economic growth and poverty reduction in the region. Countries could differ widely in terms of the economic costs they face. In South Asia, the economic costs were projected to be 12.6% of the GDP for the Maldives, which is the highest among the South Asian countries, and 6.6% for Sri Lanka, the least among the South Asian countries. The resultant adaptation costs for countries were projected to range from 0.36% (Copenhagen Cancun Scenario for 2050) to 1.32% (business-as-usual scenario) of the GDP in various scenarios during 2010–2050 (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>Medium agreement </span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ahmed--2014">Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><a class="reference-link" href="#Arto--2019">Arto et al.

The cumulative adaptation costs for 2015–2016 were reported to be 276 million USD for agriculture and 0.163 million USD for fisheries. In comparison, the modelled cumulative agricultural GDP loss due to climate-change impacts was reported to be 5% up to 2050, and 8% for infrastructure. Adaptation interventions, such as embankments, were found to provide an avoided losses (adaptation benefits) to the tune of 2.2% of the delta’s GDP by 2050. Similarly, input subsidies in seeds, fertilisers and biofertilisers were found to buffer the shocks in agriculture by 10%, and buffer the GDP per capita by 3% (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arto--2019">Arto et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><a class="reference-link" href="#Markandya--2019">Markandya and González-Eguino (2019)</a> have estimated the adaptation costs and residual adaptation costs accrued due to insufficient adaptation using integrated assessment models. Using the residual damages as a measure of loss and damage, the authors have estimated adaptation costs and residual costs under scenarios of high damages–low discount rate and low damages–high discount rate. The estimates suggested adaptation costs of 182 and 193 billion USD by 2050, and 737 and 783 billion USD by 2100 for South Asia and East Asia, respectively, under the scenario of high damages–low discount rate. The residual costs for the same scenario were 289 and 76% for 2050 and 238 and 62% for 2100 for South Asia and East Asia, respectively. Estimates for low damages–high discount rate were significantly lower adaptation costs and residual costs for both of these sub-regions of Asia.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The CCA efforts can be characterised as fragmented, incoherent and lacking perspective (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ahmed--2019a">Ahmed et al., 2019a</a>), and the picture on adaptation financing can be stated as similarly fragmented with very limited literature published in peer-reviewed journals. Adaptation financing is crucial for supporting vulnerable countries and enhances adaptation, as it is evident that the enhanced adaptation finance support has positively affected the pace of adaptation in low-income countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ford--2015">Ford et al., 2015</a>). At the organisational level, adaptation financing has provided multiple functions that include risk assessment functions, valuation functions and risk disclosure functions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Linnenluecke--2016">Linnenluecke et al., 2016</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Of the total global public adaptation finance of 28 billion USD, East Asia and the Asia–Pacific attracted 46% of the total funding, while South Asian countries attracted only 9% of the total funding (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2016">UNEP, 2016</a>). These differences reflect the capacity of countries to attract adaptation finance. Some of the important adaptation-targeted climate funds are Pilot Programmes for Climate Resilience, Green Climate Fund, and Least-Developed Countries Fund, and South Asian countries have significantly benefited from these dedicated climate funds. Due to the disaster implications of climate change, there is a need to allocate adaptation finances for DRR. Estimates suggest that East Asia and the Asia–Pacific in general allocated 27% of the total adaptation funds to DRR, while South Asia allocated 25% (<a class="reference-link" href="#Caravani--2016">Caravani, 2016</a>).

Kameyama et al.

A combination of public, private, bilateral and multilateral funding sources, and carbon-market offsets, were suggested to achieve this level of funding. In terms of the total resources available, a combination of public, private and bi- and multi-lateral funding could help the region to raise as much as 222.3–412.5 billion USD annually, with a possibility to reach higher amounts depending on the future economic growth of countries in the region. Soil carbon sequestration in agricultural soils was found to be a win–win solution for both mitigation and adaptation as it can help improve soils while increasing farm yields and incomes of smallholders (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aryal--2020a">Aryal et al., 2020a</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">New adaptation financing sources have been emerging which could provide country-specific adaptation financing suiting local-level adaptation needs in Asia.

Some studies have conducted cost assessments using a combination of stakeholder consultations and quantitative modelling of climate-change impacts and adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ahmed--2014">Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014</a>), while others depended solely on the quantitative modelling. Studies also differ in the coverage of sectors too: they either have focused on the multiple vulnerable sectors (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ahmed--2014">Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014</a>) or on a single sector (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hossain--2019">Hossain et al., 2019</a>). Studies have differed in their estimates depending on their ability to take into consideration the transition costs of sudden adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hossain--2019">Hossain et al., 2019</a>), the nature of social cost and/or damage functions employed (<a class="reference-link" href="#Arto--2019">Arto et al., 2019</a>), the discount rates applied (<a class="reference-link" href="#Markandya--2019">Markandya and González-Eguino, 2019</a>) and consideration for the effects of GHG mitigation on adaptation needs (<a class="reference-link" href="#Duan--2019a">Duan et al., 2019a</a>). In addition, the assumptions made on the pace of adaptation in estimating adaptation costs can make a difference in adaptation cost estimates. Adaptation at a slow or normal pace could require more adaptation finance, as large amounts of damage are not eliminated, than when adaptation is implemented at a faster rate (<a class="reference-link" href="#Markandya--2019">Markandya and González-Eguino, 2019</a>). Although there have been improvements in adaptation cost estimates, there is a need to address the issue of endogeneity (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kousky--2014">Kousky, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Samuel--2019">Samuel et al., 2019</a>). The vast majority of studies that rely on databases, such as EM-DAT, tend to suffer from such endogeneity problems due to their inability to control the causality between GDP and damages (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kousky--2014">Kousky, 2014</a>). Costs attributable to non-economic losses and damages are the least reported and least quantified in the adaptation costs literature due to lack of sufficient, robust and accessible methodologies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Chiba--2017">Chiba et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chiba--2019">Chiba et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Serdeczny--2019">Serdeczny, 2019</a>). This is a major limitation in assessing adaptation costs and financial needs, and it can lead to gross underestimation of adaptation costs.

The emphasis has been mainly on mitigating the adverse selection and moral hazard that have been the limitations of traditional area-based crop insurance approaches (<a class="reference-link" href="#He--2019">He et al., 2019</a>). This has been achieved by shifting the indemnity calculations on to the specific weather parameters and developing a weather index (<a class="reference-link" href="#Greatrex--2015">Greatrex et al., 2015</a>; Fischer, 2019). Technological applications in the development of insurance products have seen significant progress, including that of the blockchain and smart contracts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gatteschi--2018">Gatteschi et al., 2018</a>). There are technological developments in loss estimation, which has been a major limitation in the traditional insurance approaches in the past that either delayed the indemnity payment or misjudged the losses. Application of multi-model and multi-stage decision support systems has begun to make crop loss assessments for insurance more efficient (<a class="reference-link" href="#Aggarwal--2020">Aggarwal et al., 2020</a>). Technological applications also include remote sensing (<a class="reference-link" href="#Di--2017">Di et al., 2017</a>) and mobile phone app technologies (<a class="reference-link" href="#Meena--2018">Meena et al., 2018</a>) to provide accurate and quick damage assessments, and application of Internet-based indemnity approvals have enabled quick payment of indemnities (<a class="reference-link" href="#OECD--2017b">OECD, 2017b</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="10.5.5.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">10.5.5.2 Findings <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-44-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">As against financing post-disaster relief and reconstruction, which has been the norm of disaster management for decades in Asia, the evolution of ex-ante risk financing in the form of risk insurance has seen a steady rise globally and in Asia. The rise in popularity for risk financing in general and insurance in specific stem from the observation that governments have recognised the burden of mainly financing the post-disaster relief and reconstruction only (<a class="reference-link" href="#Juswanto--2017">Juswanto and Nugroho, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNESCAP--2018c">UNESCAP, 2018c</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#ADB--2019">ADB, 2019</a>), and from the realisation of cost savings and efficiency that risk financing for risk mitigation brings overall risk reduction (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>). As a result, a gamut of risk-financing instruments have been introduced to finance DRR and CCA initiatives in Asia among which risk insurance has gained prominence for it provides a low-cost and easy option for individuals, provides an opportunity for the governments to effectively engage the private sector in implementation and has the ability to inculcate risk-aware decision making at various levels (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hazell--2017">Hazell and Hess, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#UNESCAP--2018c">UNESCAP, 2018c</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Several Asian countries, including India, the Philippines and China, have a significant experience of offering agricultural insurance against typhoons, droughts and floods (<a class="reference-link" href="#Yang--2018">Yang, 2018</a>). For the most part, these insurance systems have followed a traditional indemnity-based insurance which faces several challenges in implementation including moral hazard and adverse selection, disagreements and delays in crop-damage assessments that relied upon crop-cutting experiments, often leading to a delay in processing indemnity payments, costly insurance premiums and poor insurance expansion (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span>) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Patnaik--2017">Patnaik and Swain, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ghosh--2019">Ghosh et al., 2019</a>). Other factors contributing to poor penetration of insurance include limited awareness on the importance of insurance, and poor access.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">To tackle the problem of costly insurance premiums, governments have subsidised the premiums (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ghosh--2019">Ghosh et al., 2019</a>). Premium subsidies have been reported to undermine the ability to convey the real cost of risks by the insured (price distortion), and have encouraged adverse selection and moral hazard (<a class="reference-link" href="#Nguyen--2019">Nguyen and Jolly, 2019</a>). On the contrary, subsidies have been suggested to address the issue of adverse selection associated with the insurance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zhao--2017c">Zhao et al., 2017c</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Despite the fact that the insurance programmes are able to obtain high participation rates due to subsidised premiums, their impact on farmers’ income seems to be insignificant especially under the conditions of low indemnities, low guarantee and wide coverage (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zhao--2016a">Zhao et al., 2016a</a>). The subsidy burden of insurance on national governments is found to be significant with an estimated equivalent of 6 billion USD spent by China alone on insurance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hazell--2017">Hazell et al., 2017</a>). In addition, the insurance programmes in Asian countries are reporting higher producer claim ratios, and often governments have to spend more than the money being transferred to the insured through the insurance programmes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hazell--2017">Hazell et al., 2017</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">To address the issues associated with traditional indemnity insurance, efforts have been made to develop weather-index insurance in Asia that bases the payouts on the rainfall or temperature index, rather than on the direct damage measurements. The parametric insurance products help avoid the delays in insurance payouts as they are based on modelled risks, rather than actual damage measurements, and control the adverse selection and moral hazard, although basis risks could be increased due to improper matching of payouts with the index (<a class="reference-link" href="#De%20Leeuw--2014">De Leeuw et al., 2014</a>).

Some Asian countries and regions offer solutions to overcome these barriers: through use of advanced technologies (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>in situ</span> observation and remote sensing, a variety of new sensor technologies, citizen science, AI and machine learning tools); regional partnerships and learning; improved forecasting capabilities; and better risk awareness (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Asian countries are repeatedly identified as the most vulnerable to climatic risks with key sectors such as agriculture, cities and infrastructure, and terrestrial ecosystems expected to see high exposure to multiple hazards (<a class="section-link" data-title="Regional and Sub-regional Characteristics" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-10#10.3">Section 10.3</a>).

The food–water–energy–land nexus has diverse implications at the sub-regional level in Asia. The increase in the water-supply gap raises questions about the sustainability of the main mode of electricity generation in South Asia. Thermal power generation and hydropower generation are both threatened by water shortages in South Asia (Luo, 2018b; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mitra--2021">Mitra et al., 2021</a>). Furthermore, policy-mismatch-driven anthropogenic causes lead to unsustainable water use for food production in India. For example, subsidised electricity supply for watering agriculture plays a key role in losing groundwater’s buffer capacity against the various changes including climate variabilities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Badiani--2012">Badiani et al., 2012</a>; Mitra, 2017).

Climate change is affecting every aspect of our society and economy; thus, it is pertinent to understand the interactions between social justice and climate-change impacts (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tol--2018">Tol, 2018</a>), in particular, focusing on how vulnerability to various impacts is created, maintained and distributed across geographic, social, demographic and economic dimensions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bulkeley--2014">Bulkeley et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schlosberg--2014">Schlosberg and Collins, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Van%20de%20Vliert--2014">Van de Vliert, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Burke--2016">Burke et al., 2016</a>).

Furthermore, great concern is expressed about the plight of the poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable populations when it comes to climate, but not in other policy domains (Winters, 2014).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Evidence is increasing on the importance of focusing on environmental sustainability, and relieving poverty and social injustice are not conflicting aims; in fact, there is a further need for mainstreaming such approaches in order to respond to the climate-change challenge in a socially just manner (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mayrhofer--2016">Mayrhofer and Gupta, 2016</a>). These non-conflicting aims are described as co-benefits as reiterated in the IPCC reports as a central concept that refers to ‘the positive effects that a policy or measure aimed at one objective might have on other objectives, irrespective of the net effect on overall social welfare’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2014b">IPCC, 2014b</a>). Better understanding of how social justice affects, and is affected by, efforts to build adaptive capacity will be crucial to avoiding unintended, and even perverse, outcomes. For example, on the Andaman coast of Thailand, responses to climate-change trends and events tended to be reactive rather than proactive, making already vulnerable people even more vulnerable and undermining their capacity to adapt in the future (<a class="reference-link" href="#Bennett--2014">Bennett et al., 2014</a>). Different forms of inequality, moreover, render some groups more vulnerable than others to damage from climate hazards. In Mumbai, India, for example, the houses of poorer families required repeated repairs to secure them against flood damage, and the cumulative cost of those repairs consumed a greater proportion of their income than for richer populations (<a class="reference-link" href="#UN--2016">UN, 2016</a>). Building the resilience of vulnerable groups requires strong community and government institutions that can support efforts to cope with devastating events, offering SP and social development initiatives to support at-risk or vulnerable groups (<a class="reference-link" href="#Drolet--2015">Drolet et al., 2015</a>). In addition, agencies need to consider how they can best work in ways which potentially support longer-term positive change to gender roles and relations.

The five deep social reforms (redistribution, recognition, restitution, regeneration and resistance) of socially just land policy are necessarily intertwined. But the global land rush amid deepening climate change calls attention to the linkages, especially between the pursuit of agrarian justice, on the one hand, and climate justice, on the other. Here, the relationship is not without contradictions and warrants increased attention as both unit of analysis and object of political action. Understanding and deepening agrarian-justice imperatives in climate politics, and understanding and deepening climate-justice imperatives in agrarian politics, is needed more than ever in the ongoing pursuit of alternatives. For example, the intersection between land grabs and climate-change mitigation politics in Myanmar has created new political opportunities for scaling up, expanding and deepening the struggles towards ‘agrarian climate justice’(<a class="reference-link" href="#Sekine--2021">Sekine, 2021</a>).</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="frequently-asked-questions"><h1 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_head" lang="en-US">Frequently Asked Questions </h1><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 10.1"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 10.1 | What are the current and projected key risks related to climate change in each sub-region of Asia?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-27-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Climate-change-related risks are projected to increase progressively at 1.5</span>°<span class="condensed_italic" lang>C, 2</span>°<span class="condensed_italic" lang>C and 3</span>°<span class="condensed_italic" lang>C of global warming in many parts of Asia. Heat stress and water deficit are affecting human health and food security. Risks due to extreme rainfall and sea level rise are exacerbated in vulnerable Asia. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Climatologically, the summer surface air temperature in South, Southeast and Southwest Asia is high, and its coastal area is very humid. In these regions, heat stress is already a medium risk for humans. Large cities are warmer by more than 2°C compared with the surroundings due to heat island effects, exacerbating heat stress conditions. Future warming will cause more frequent temperature extremes and heatwaves especially in densely populated South Asian cities, where working conditions will be exacerbated and daytime outdoor work will become dangerous. For example, incidence of excess heat-related mortality in 51 cities in China is estimated to reach 37,800 deaths per year over a 20-year period in the mid-21st century (2041–2060) under the RCP8.5 scenario.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Asian glaciers are the water resources for local and adjacent regions. Glaciers are decreasing in Central, Southwest, Southeast and North Asia, but are stable or increased in some parts of the Hindu Kush Himalaya region. The glacier melt water in the southern Tibetan Plateau increased during 1998–2007, and the total amount and area of glacier lakes has increased during recent decades. In the future, maximum glacial runoff is projected in High Mountain Asia. Glacier collapses and surges, together with glacier lake outburst flood due to the expansion of glacier lakes, will threaten the securities of the local and down streaming societies.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">With much of the Asian population living in drought-prone areas, water scarcity is a prevailing risk across Asia through water and food shortage leading to malnutrition. Populations vulnerable to impacts related to water are going to increase progressively at 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C of global warming. Aggravating drought condition is projected in Central Asia. Water quality degradation also has profound impact on human health.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Extreme rainfall causes floods in vulnerable rivers. Observed changes in extreme rainfall vary considerably by region in Asia. Extreme rainfall events (such as heavy rainfall &gt;100 mm per day) have been increasing in South and East Asia. In the future, most of East and Southeast Asia are projected to experience more intense rainfall events as soon as by the middle of the 21st century. In those regions, the flood risk will become more frequent and severe. It is estimated that over one-third of Asian cities and about 932 million urban dwellers are living in areas with high risk of flooding.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Sea level rise is continuing. Higher than the global mean sea level rise is projected on Asian coasts. Storm surge and high wave by tropical cyclones of higher intensity are high risk for a large number of Asian megacities facing the ocean: China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam have the highest numbers of coastal populations exposed and thus are most vulnerable to disaster-related mortality.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Changes in terrestrial biome have been observed that are consistent with warming, such as an upward move of treeline position in mountains. Climate change, human activity, lightning and quality of forest governance and management have increased wildfire severity and area burned in North Asia in recent decades. Changes in marine primary production also have been observed: a decrease up to 20% over the past six decades in the western Indian Ocean, due to ocean warming and stratification, has restricted nutrient mixing. The risk of irreversible loss of many ecosystems will increase with global warming.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The likelihood of adverse impacts to agricultural and food security in many parts of developing Asia will progressively escalate with the changing climate.

Several of these adaptation actions show promise, reducing vulnerability and improving societal well-being. However, challenges remain around scaling up adaptation actions in a manner that is effective and inclusive while simultaneously meeting national development goals. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Asia exhibits tremendous variation in terms of ecosystems, economic development, cultures and climate risk exposure. Mirroring this variation, households, communities and governments have a wide range of coping and adaptation strategies to deal with changing climatic conditions, with co-benefits for various non-climatic issues such as poverty, conflict and livelihood dynamics.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Currently, Asian countries have rich evidence on managing risk, drawing on long histories of dealing with change. For example, to deal with erratic rainfall and shifting monsoons, farmers make incremental shifts such as changing what and when they grow or adjusting their irrigation practices. Communities living in coastal settlements are using Early warning systems to prepare for cyclones or raising the height of their houses to minimise flood impacts. These types of strategies, seen across all Asian sub-regions, based on local social and ecological contexts, are termed <span class="condensed_italic" lang>autonomous adaptations</span> that occur incrementally and help people manage current impacts.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Currently and in the future, Asia is identified as one of regions most vulnerable to climate change, especially on extreme heat, flooding, sea level rise and erratic rainfall. All these climatic risks, when overlaid on existing development deficits, show us that incremental adaptation will not be enough; transformational change is required. Recognising this, at subnational and national levels, government and non-governmental actors are also prioritising <span class="condensed_italic" lang>planned adaptation strategies</span> which include interventions like ‘climate-smart agriculture’ as seen in South and Southeast Asian countries, or changing labour laws to reduce exposure to heat as seen in West Asia. These are often sectoral priorities governments lay out through national or subnational policies and projects, drawing on various sources of funding: domestic, bilateral and international. Apart from these planned adaptation strategies in social systems, Asian countries also report and invest in adaptation measures in natural systems such as expanding nature reserves to enable species conservation or setting up habitat corridors to facilitate landscape connectivity and species movements across climatic gradients.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Overall, the fundamental challenges that Asia will see exacerbated under climate change are around water and food insecurity, poverty and inequality, and increased frequency and severity of extreme events. In some places and for some people, climate change, even at 1.5°C and more so at 2°C, will significantly constrain the functioning and well-being of human and ecological systems. Asian cities, villages and countries are rising to this current and projected challenge, albeit somewhat unevenly.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Some examples of innovative adaptation actions are China’s ‘Sponge Cities’ which are trying to protect ecosystems while reducing risk for people, now and in the future. Another example is India’s Heat Action Plans that are using ‘cool roofs’ technologies and awareness-building campaigns to reduce the impacts of extreme heat. Across South and Southeast Asia, climate-smart agriculture programmes are reducing GHG emissions associated with farming while helping farmers adapt to changing risks. Each country is experimenting with infrastructural, nature-based, technological, institutional and behavioural strategies to adapt to current and future climate change with local contexts shaping both the possibility of undertaking such actions as well as the effectiveness of these actions to reduce risk. What works for ageing cities in Japan exposed to heatwaves and floods may not work for pastoral communities in the highlands of Central Asia, but there is progress on understanding what actions work and for whom. The challenge is to scale current adaptation action, especially in the most exposed areas and for the most vulnerable populations, as well as move beyond adapting to single risks alone (i.e., adapt to multiple coinciding risks such as flooding and water scarcity in coastal cities across South Asia or extreme heat and flash floods in West Asia). In this context, funding and implementing adaptation is essential, and while Asian countries are experimenting with a range of autonomous and planned adaptation actions to deal with these multiple and often concurrent challenges, making current development pathways climate resilient is necessary and, some might argue, unavoidable.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Table_title" lang="en-US"><span

knowledge being incorporated in the design and implementation of adaptation projects and policies in Asia?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-29-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Indigenous People, comprising about 6% of the global population, play a crucial role in managing climate change for two important reasons. First, they have a physical and spiritual connection with land, water and associated ecosystems, thus making them most vulnerable to any environmental and climatic changes. Second, their ecological and local knowledge are relevant to finding solutions to climate change. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (IKLK) play an important role in the formulation of adaptation governance and related strategies (IPCC 2007), and best quality, locality-specific knowledge can help address the serious lack of education on climate change and uncertainties surrounding quality, salience, credibility and the legitimacy of the available knowledge base.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Key findings across Asia underline the importance of building, sustaining and augmenting local capacity through addressing inadequacies in terms of resource base, climate-change awareness, government–community partnerships and vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, inclusion of as well as related practices will improve adaptation planning and decision-making processes concerning climate change.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">In climate-sensitive livelihoods, an integrated approach informed by science that examines multiple stressors, along with IKLK, appears to be of immense value. For instance, in building farmers’ resilience, enhancing CCA, ensuring cross-cultural communication and promoting local skills, Indigenous People’s intuitive thinking processes and geographic knowledge of remote areas are very important.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">There is also a widespread recognition that IKLK are important in ensuring successful ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA). However, this recognition requires more practical application and translation into IKLK-driven EbA projects. For instance, in the Coral Triangle region, creating historical timelines and mapping seasonal calendars can help to capture IKLK while also feeding this information into climate science and climate adaptation planning. Identifying indigenous crop species for agriculture by using IKLK is already identified as an important way to localise climate adaptation: an example is Bali’s vital contribution of moral economies to food systems which have long built resilience among groups of communities in terms of food security and sovereignty, even with the challenges faced due to modernising of local food systems.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Many of the pressing problems of Asia, including water scarcity, rapid urbanisation, deforestation, loss of species, rising coastal hazards and agricultural loss can be effectively negated, or at least minimised, through proper adoption of suitable science and technological methods. Climate-change adaptation is greatly facilitated by science, technology and innovation. This ranges from application of existing science, new development on scientific tools and methods, application of IKLK and citizen sciences. Deploying Knowledge Quality Assessment Tool found significant co-relation between science-based and IKLK framing would help to address, acknowledge and utilise by an integrated approach the wisdom of IKLK, a valuable asset for climate adaptation governance. The IKLK-based environmental indicators need to be seen as part of a separate system of knowledge that coexists with, but is not submerged into, another conventional knowledge system.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">In the context of education and capacity development of climate change, an integrated approach of embracing both the importance of climate science and IKLK is acknowledged. The IKLK is increasingly recognised as a powerful tool for compiling evidence of climate change over time. Such as knowledge of CCA and DRR provide a range of complementary approaches in building resilience and reducing the vulnerability of natural and human systems. Developing knowledge and utilising existing IKLK, skills and dispositions to better cope with already evident and looming climate impacts. Engaging communities in the process of documenting and understanding long-term trends and practices will enable both IKLK as well as Western scientific assessments of climate change to contribute in designing appropriate climate adaptation measures.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 10.4"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 10.4 | How can Asia meet multiple goals of climate-change adaptation and sustainable development within the coming decades?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-30-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Asian countries are testing ways to develop in a climate-resilient manner to meet the goals related to climate change and sustainable development simultaneously. Some promising examples exist, but the window of opportunity to put some of these plans in place is small and closing fast, highlighting the need for urgent action across and within countries. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">In order to achieve the multiple goals of CCA, mitigation and sustainable development, critical are rapid, system transitions across (a) energy systems, (b) land and ecosystems and (c) urban and infrastructural systems. This is especially important across Asia, which has the largest population exposed to current climate risks and high sub-regional diversity, and where risks are expected to rise significantly and unevenly under higher levels of global warming. However, such transformational change is deeply challenging because of variable national development imperatives; differing capacities and requirements of large, highly unequal and vulnerable populations; and socioeconomic and ecological diversity that requires very contextual solutions. Furthermore, issues such as growing transboundary risks, inadequate data for long-term adaptation planning, finance barriers, uneven institutional capacity and non-climatic issues, such as increasing conflict, political instability and polarization, constrain rapid, transformational action across systems.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Despite these challenges, there are increasing examples of actions across Asia that are meeting climate adaptation goals and SDGs simultaneously, such as through climate-smart agriculture, disaster risk management and NbS. To enable these system transitions, vertical and horizontal policy linkages, active communication and cooperation between multiple stakeholders, and attention to the root causes of vulnerability are essential. Furthermore, rapid systemic transformation can be enabled by policies and finances to incentivise capacity building, new technological innovation and diffusion. The effectiveness of such technology-centred approaches can be maximised by combining them with attention to behavioural shifts such as by improving education and awareness, building local capacities and institutions, and leveraging IKLK.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Obviously, time is of the essence. If system transitions are delayed, there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> that climatic risks will increase human and natural system vulnerability, as well as increase inequality and erode the achievements of multiple SDGs. Thus, urgent systemic change that is suited to national and subnational social–ecological contexts across Asia is imperative.</p><div class="Figure"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-12" id="figure-10-faq-10.4.1" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_10_FAQ_10_4.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure FAQ10.4.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Adaptation options, mitigation impacts and implications on Sustainable Development Goals. </span></p></div></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_References_head" lang="en-GB"><span>References</span> </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-7-siblings"><p class="References_References_body" id="Aayog--2017" lang="en-GB">Aayog, N., 2017: <span class="condensed_italic" lang>Inventory and Revival of Springs in the Himalayas for Water Security</span>.

In urban areas, EbA includes improving ecological structures (e.g., maintaining watersheds, forests, green roofs), ecological functions and processes (e.g., wetland functioning for flood protection), valuation measures (including monetary or non-monetary values to ecosystem service benefits) and investing in ecosystem management practices (i.e., enabling adaption co-benefits through the maintenance, preservation and restoration or creation of ecological structures) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Liu--2014a">Liu et al., 2014a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Brink--2016">Brink et al., 2016</a>). Thus, EbA adaptation actions include protecting urban green spaces, improving permeability, fostering urban agriculture, mangrove restoration in coastal cities, improved wetland management and so forth (<a class="reference-link" href="#Doswald--2014">Doswald et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Brink--2016">Brink et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Coninck--2018">de Coninck et al., 2018</a>).</p></div><div class="_idFootnote" id="footnote-003"><p class="Body_Footnotes" lang="en-US"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="ch10.html#footnote-003-backlink">10</a> 11 The set of technical, financial and institutional capacities needed to generate and disseminate timely and meaningful warning information to enable individuals, communities and organisations threatened by a hazard to prepare to act promptly and appropriately to reduce the possibility of harm or loss. Depending on context, EWS may draw upon scientific and/or Indigenous knowledge. These EWS are also considered for ecological applications (e.g., conservation, where the organisation itself is not threatened by hazard but the ecosystem under conservation is; an example is coral bleaching alerts), in agriculture (e.g., warnings of ground frost and hailstorms) and in fisheries (e.g., storm and tsunami warnings) (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018a">IPCC, 2018a</a>).</p></div><div class="_idFootnote" id="footnote-002"><p class="Body_Footnotes" lang="en-US"><a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="ch10.html#footnote-002-backlink">11</a> 12 Two exceptions to this were found. One is a survey in Saudi Arabia which tested public perceptions of disaster risk and found that direct experience with such disasters does not directly influence risk perception (<a class="reference-link" href="#Alshehri--2013">Alshehri et al., 2013</a>). Second, a study on flood experience and ensuing adaptation behaviour in Pakistan found that those with prior flood experience do not make significantly different choices than those who have no experience of flooding.

Others, however, highlight that higher risk perception can lead to a normalisation of risks, leading to lower climate action (Luís et al., 2018). In all of these papers, there is a recognition that the literature on perceptual drivers of climate action is USA-centric and is negligible in Asia (Capstick et al. 2015).</p></div></div><p
