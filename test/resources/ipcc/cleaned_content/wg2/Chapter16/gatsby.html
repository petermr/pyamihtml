Examples include the rapid growth in attribution of specific extreme weather events, the use of scientific evidence of climate change impacts in legal cases, and the context of the Paris Agreement’s Article 8 on ‘averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage’ associated with climate change, but also the stronger links between adaptation and disaster risk reduction, including early-warning systems, wider discussions on how to build resilience in the face of a more volatile climate, and attention for limits to adaptation that are already being reached.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Of course, the scale of these risks is also determined by the <span class="condensed_italic" lang>responses</span> to climate change, mainly in how they reduce risk, but also how they may create risks (sometimes inadvertently, and sometimes to others than those who implement the response, in other places, or later in time). Our focus is on adaptation responses, given that mitigation is covered in Working Group III (WGIII) AR6, but we acknowledge certain important interactions, such as biomass production as an alternative to fossil fuels which can compete with food production and thus aggravate adaptation challenges.

However, assessment of key risks across a range of future warming levels remains a high priority for several reasons: (1) understanding risks at higher levels of warming can help prepare for them, should efforts to limit warming be unsuccessful (<a class="reference-link" href="#UNEP--2017">UNEP, 2017</a>); (2) understanding risks at higher levels can inform the benefits of limiting warming to lower levels; (3) in addition, there is continued debate about whether warming limits should be at or rather somewhere below 2°C (in particular at 1.5°C); and (4) there is a more explicit recognition that key risks can result not only from increased warming, but also from changes in the exposure and vulnerability of society, and from a lack of ambitious adaptation efforts. Thus, relatively limited warming does not automatically imply that key risks will not occur. In assessing key risks, we have applied four criteria: magnitude of adverse consequences, likelihood of adverse consequences, temporal characteristics of the risk, and ability to respond. Of course, this is an aggregated approach to what is dangerous; it should be noted that in practice, ‘dangerous’ will occur at a myriad of temperature levels depending on who or what is at risk (and their circumstances), geographic scale and time scale.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">A new element is that we particularly look at a set of eight ‘representative key risks’ that exemplify the underlying set of key risks identified in the earlier chapters: risk to the integrity of low-lying coastal socio-ecological systems, risk to terrestrial and ocean ecosystems, risk to critical physical infrastructure and networks, risk to living standards (including economic impacts, poverty and inequality), risk to human health, risk to food security, risk to water security, and risk to peace and human mobility (<a class="section-link" data-title="Assessment of Representative Key Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.2.3">Section 16.5.2.3</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Another increased focus relates to the issue of compound risks.

The TAR first synthesised this knowledge in five RFCs. AR4 identified a set of ‘key vulnerabilities’ and provided an update of the RFCs. AR5 further refined a new risk framework developed in the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX), and used it to assess ‘key risks’ and provide another update of the overarching RFCs, drawing as well on Cramer et al.’s (2014) assessment of observed changes.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Our risk assessment also further builds on risk assessments from the Special Reports that are part of the AR6 cycle, that is, SR15, SRCCL and SROCC. While since AR4 the RFC assessment framework has remained largely consistent, refinements in methodology have included the consideration of different risks, the role of adaptation, use of confidence statements, more formalised protocols and standardised metrics (<a class="reference-link" href="#Zommers--2020">Zommers et al., 2020</a>).

Note that these global trends may <span class="condensed_italic" lang>increase</span> but also <span class="condensed_italic" lang>reduce</span> exposure and/or vulnerability, for instance when growing incomes, savings and social protection systems increase resilience in the face of shocks and stresses. Drivers and future trends in vulnerability and exposure—next to climate-induced changes in natural hazards—therefore need to be considered in comprehensive risk assessments and eventually adaptation solutions, but empirical research suggests that they remain to be underemphasised in current national adaptation planning (<a class="reference-link" href="#Garschagen--2021a">Garschagen et al., 2021a</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">While these risk drivers are often listed separately, they are often closely interconnected, including between human and ecological systems, and increasingly also through climate risks and responses (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Simpson--2021">Simpson et al., 2021</a>). Climate impacts increasingly affect these drivers, and may compete with financial resources that could otherwise be applied for development, mitigation, adaptation and resilience building, also affecting inequalities (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Taconet--2020">Taconet et al., 2020</a>).</p><div class="h3-container" id="16.1.4.1"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">16.1.4.1 Demographics <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-5-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Population growth (or decline) can result in increasing (or decreasing) pressure on natural resources (e.g., soils, water and fish stocks) (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPBES--2019">IPBES, 2019</a>), and can result in the expansion of densely populated areas (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cardona--2012">Cardona et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Day--2016">Day et al., 2016</a>).

Building assets and infrastructure in naturally risk-prone areas are also projected to increase (<a class="reference-link" href="#Magnan--2019">Magnan et al., 2019</a>), which may also lead to environmental degradation that can further aggravate risk, such as destruction of wetlands that buffer against floods (<a class="reference-link" href="#Schuerch--2018">Schuerch et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2019">Oppenheimer et al., 2019</a>). Demographic trends, coupled with changes in income, can also result in increasing demands for land, food, water and energy, and therefore in major changes in land use and cover change (Arneth, 2019). The observed and projected population decline in some rural areas also has implications for vulnerability and exposure.

As a result, the capacity of ecosystems to support human society is thought to be coming under threat.

The distribution of impacts and responses (adaptation and mitigation) affects inequality, not just between countries but also within countries (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Tol--2020">Tol, 2020</a>) and between different people within societies. Distribution has so far largely been thought of in a geographical sense, but identifying those most at risk requires an additional focus on the social distribution of impacts, responses, and resilience, as influenced for instance by differential social protection coverage (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tenzing--2020">Tenzing, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Many climate responses interact with all of these global risk drivers.

The counterfactual baseline may be stationary or may change over time, for example due to direct human influences such as changes in land use patterns and agricultural or water management affecting exposure and vulnerability to climate-related hazards (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Observed Impacts of changes in climate-related systems" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.2.3">Section 16.2.3</a> for methods on how to construct the counterfactual baseline).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In line with the AR5 definition, ‘changes in climate-related systems’ here refer to any long-term trend, irrespective of the underlying causes; thus, an observed impact is not necessarily an observed impact of anthropogenic climate forcing. For example, in this section, sea level rise is defined as relative sea level rise measured against a land-based reference frame (tide gauge measurements), meaning that it is driven not only by thermal expansion and loss of land ice influenced by anthropogenic climate forcing, but also by vertical land movements. As attribution of coastal damages to sea level rise does not distinguish between these components, it does not imply attribution to anthropogenic forcing. Where the literature does allow attribution of changes in natural, human or managed systems to anthropogenic climate forcing (‘joint attribution’, <a class="reference-link" href="#Rosenzweig--2007">Rosenzweig et al., 2007</a>), this is highlighted in the assessment. Often the attribution of changes in the natural, human or managed systems to anthropogenic forcing can be done in a two-step approach where (i) an observed change in a climate-related system is attributed to anthropogenic climate forcing (‘climate attribution’) and (ii) changes in natural, human or managed systems are attributed to this change in the climate-related system (‘impact attribution’).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">For climate attribution, the main challenge is the separation of externally human forced changes in the climate-related systems from their internal variability, while for impact attribution it often is the separation of the effects of other external forcings (i.e., direct human influences or natural disturbances) from the impacts of the changes in the climate-related systems. Direct influences not related to changes in the climate-related systems could, for example, be pollution and land use changes amplifying biodiversity losses, intensification of fishing reducing fish stocks, and increasing protection reducing losses due to river floods. The direct human or natural influences may counter the impacts of climate change (e.g., climate change may have reduced flood hazards, but exposure may have increased as people have moved to flood-prone areas, resulting in no change in observed damages). Given the definition of impact attribution, this means that there may be an observed impact of climate change without the detection of a change in the natural, human or managed system. This is different from ‘climate attribution’, where detection and attribution usually are consecutive steps.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Changes in climate-related systems can certainly also affect natural, human and managed systems through indirect effects on land use, pollution or exposure. However, these indirect effects are barely addressed in existing studies.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In addition to impact attribution, there is research on the identification of natural, human or managed systems’ response to short-term (typically daily, monthly or annual) weather fluctuations or individual <span class="condensed_italic" lang>extreme weather events</span>. As different from impact attribution, we separately define:</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">‘Identification of weather sensitivity’</span> refers to the attribution of the response of a system to fluctuations in weather and short-term changes in the climate-related systems including individual <span class="condensed_italic" lang>extreme weather events</span> (e.g., a heatwave or storm surge).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Typical questions addressed include: ‘How much of the observed variability of crop yields is due to variations in weather conditions compared to contributions from management changes?’ (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Ray--2015">Ray et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#M%C3%BCller--2017">Müller et al., 2017</a>) and ‘Can weather fluctuations explain part of the observed variability in annual national economic growth rates?’ (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Burke--2015">Burke et al., 2015</a>). Identification of weather sensitivity may also address the effects of individual <span class="condensed_italic" lang>climate extremes</span>, for example asking, ‘Was the observed outbreak of cholera triggered by an associated flood event?’ (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Rinaldo--2012">Rinaldo et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Moore--2017b">Moore et al., 2017b</a>). It is important to note that sensitivity could be described in diverse ways and that, for example, the fraction of the observed variability in a system explained by weather variability differs from the strength of the systems’ response to a specific change in a weather variable. Nevertheless, all these different measures are integrated in the ‘identification of weather sensitivity’ assessment, where ‘sensitivity’ should not be considered a quantitative one-dimensional mathematical measure.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In this chapter, we explicitly distinguish between assessment statements related to ‘climate attribution’ (listed in Table SM16.21), ‘impact attribution’ (listed in Table SM16.22) and ‘identification of weather sensitivity’ (listed in Table SM16.23). The identification of ‘weather sensitivity’ does not necessarily imply that there also is an impact of long-term changes in the climate-related systems on the considered system. However, if the probability or intensity of an <span class="condensed_italic" lang>extreme weather event </span> has increased due to anthropogenic forcing (‘climate attribution’) (<a class="reference-link" href="#NASEM--2016">NASEM, 2016</a>; WGI AR6 <a class="section-link" data-title="Australasia" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-11">Chapter 11</a> <a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2021">Seneviratne et al., 2021</a>) and the event is also identified as an important driver of an observed fluctuation in a natural, human or managed system (‘identification of weather sensitivity’), then the observed fluctuation is considered (partly) attributed to long-term climate change (‘impact attribution’) and even to anthropogenic forcing.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="16.2.2"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">16.2.2 Methods and Data for Impact Attribution Including Recent Advances <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-6-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">By definition, the counterfactual baseline required for impact attribution cannot be observed. However, it may be approximated by impact model simulations forced by a stationary climate, for example derived by de-trending the observed climate (<a class="reference-link" href="#Diffenbaugh--2017">Diffenbaugh et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mengel--2021">Mengel et al., 2021</a>), while other relevant drivers (e.g., land use changes or application of pesticides) of changes in the system of interest (e.g., a bird population) evolve according to historical conditions. To attribute to anthropogenic climate forcing, the anthropogenic trends in climate are estimated from a range of different climate models and subtracted from the observed climate (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Abatzoglou--2016">Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016</a>, for changes in the extent of forest fires or <a class="reference-link" href="#Diffenbaugh--2019">Diffenbaugh and Burke, 2019</a>, for effects on economic inequality) or the ‘no anthropogenic climate forcing’ baseline is directly derived from a large ensemble of climate model simulations not accounting for anthropogenic forcings (e.g., Kirchmeier-Young et al.., 2019b, for the extent of forest fires). In any case, it has to be demonstrated that the applied impact models are able to explain the observed changes in natural, human or managed systems by, for example, reproducing the observations when forced by observed changes in climate-related systems and other relevant drivers.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In a situation where an influence of other direct human drivers can be excluded (e.g., by restriction to remote areas not affected by direct human interventions), the ‘no climate-change’ baseline can also be approximated by data from early observational periods with no or minor levels of climate change. In particular, the contribution of climate change to the observed changes in ecosystems is often also determined by a ‘multiple lines of evidence’ approach where the baseline is not formally quantified but the observed changes are identified as a signal of climate change compared with a no-climate-change situation based on process understanding from, for example, palaeo data and laboratory or field experiments in combination with individual long-term observational records and the large-scale spatial or temporal pattern of observed changes that can hardly be explained by alternative drivers (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parmesan--2013">Parmesan et al., 2013</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">To date, explicit accounting for direct human or natural influences is often hampered by an incomplete understanding of the processes and limited observational data. There are, however, first studies demonstrating the potential of detailed process-based or empirical modelling that explicitly accounts for known variations in direct human or natural drivers and separate their effects from the ones induced by changes in the climate-related systems. Examples are Butler et al. (2018) for the separation of growing season adjustments from within growing season climate effects on US crop yields; <a class="reference-link" href="#Wang--2019">Wang and Hijmans (2019)</a> separating effects of shifts in land use from climate effects; <a class="reference-link" href="#Jongman--2015">Jongman et al.

However, the signal of climate change in flood-induced fatalities may be lost in the regional aggregation, where effects of increasing and decreasing hazards may cancel out. Thus, a climate-driven increase in flood-induced damages becomes detectable in continental subregions with increasing discharge, while the signal of climate change may not be detectable without disaggregation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sauer--2021">Sauer et al., 2021</a>, see ‘Water distribution—Flood induced economic damages’, Table SM16.22). Compared with river floods, the analysis of impacts of long-term changes in the climate-related systems on the reduction in water availability is much more fragmented and reduced to individual case studies regarding associated societal impacts (see ‘Water distribution—Reductions in water availability + induced damages and fatalities’, Table SM16.22). At the same time, weather fluctuations have led to reductions in water availability with severe societal consequences and high numbers of drought-induced fatalities and damages in particular in Africa and Asia (see ‘Water distribution—Reductions in water availability + induced damages and fatalities’, Table SM16.23) and impacts on malnutrition (see ‘Food system—Malnutrition’, Table SM16.23).

This complexity, in addition to the limited availability of long-term data, has so far impeded the detection and attribution of a long-term impact of climate change on associated food security indicators. However, in a few cases, observed crop prices (e.g., domestic grain price in Russia and Africa, <a class="reference-link" href="#G%C3%B6tz--2016">Götz et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mawejje--2016">Mawejje, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Baffes--2019">Baffes et al., 2019</a>) are shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in local weather through its impact on production (see ‘Food system—Food prices’, Table SM16.23).

Progress has also been made with regard to temporal changes in temperature-related excess mortality and underlying population vulnerability over time. Heat-attributable mortality fractions have declined over time in most countries owing to general improvements in health care systems, increasing prevalence of residential air conditioning, and behavioural changes. These factors, which determine the susceptibility of the population to heat, have predominated over the influence of temperature change (see ‘Other societal impacts—Heat-related mortality’, Table SM16.22, <a class="reference-link" href="#De%E2%80%99Donato--2015">De’Donato et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Arbuthnott--2016">Arbuthnott et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Vicedo-Cabrera--2018a">Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2018a</a>).

Increased temperature and high precipitation, with associated flooding events, have been shown to generally increase the risk of diarrhoeal diseases. There are, however, a number of studies that describe important exceptions and modifications to this general observation. While high temperatures favour bacterial diarrhoeal diseases, virally transmitted diarrhoea is on the contrary mostly associated with low temperatures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Carlton--2016">Carlton et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chua--2021">Chua et al., 2021</a>).

During the years 2006–2010, the Fertile Crescent region in Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia was hit by the worst drought on meteorological record, compounding a consistent drying of the region over the past half century (<a class="reference-link" href="#Trigo--2010">Trigo et al., 2010</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hoerling--2012">Hoerling et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mathbout--2018">Mathbout et al., 2018</a>, SR15 BOX 3.2 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hoegh-Guldberg--2018a">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a</a>)).

The drought had a devastating impact on agricultural production in the northeast of Syria.

Successive years with little or no income eventually forced people to leave their farms in great numbers and seek employment in less affected parts of the country, adding to existing pressures on housing, labour market and public goods provision (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gleick--2014">Gleick, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kelley--2015">Kelley et al., 2015</a>).

A number of studies argue that the principal drivers of the drought-induced economic collapse were political rather than environmental in nature, shaped by adverse economic reforms and unsustainable agricultural policies, promoting water-intensive irrigation schemes for cotton cultivation and implementing abrupt subsidy cuts at the peak of the drought, implying that many poor farmers no longer could afford fertilis ers or fuel to power irrigation pumps (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barnes--2009">Barnes, 2009</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#De%20Ch%C3%A2tel--2014">De Châtel, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Eklund--2017">Eklund and Thompson, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Selby--2017">Selby et al., 2017</a>).

The mobilisation in Syria in the spring of 2011 also made explicit references to events across the Middle East and North African region.

However, the Syrian uprising stands out in how it was met with overwhelming violent force by the police and security forces, which changed the character of the resistance and opened up for militarisation of non-state actors that further escalated the conflict (<a class="reference-link" href="#Heydemann--2013">Heydemann, 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Leenders--2013">Leenders, 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Bramsen--2020">Bramsen, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">In summary, the drought itself is shown to be attributable to GHG emissions. The agricultural losses and internal migration from rural to urban areas can be directly linked to the drought and in this way are partly attributable to GHG emissions, although there are no studies comparing the observed losses and number of people displaced with a counterfactual situation of a weaker drought in a ‘no climate change’ situation. Current research does not provide enough evidence to attribute the civil war to climate change. In contrast, it is likely that social uprisings would have occurred even without the drought.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="16.3.1"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">16.3.1 Adaptation-Related Responses by Natural Systems <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-8-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There is growing evidence of shifts in species distributions and ecosystem structure and functioning in response to climate change (Chapter 2).

Adaptation frequently occurs in response to specific rapid or slow-onset physical events that can have adverse impacts on people. In some cases, people adapt in anticipation of climate change in general or to take advantage of new opportunities created by hazards (e.g., increased navigability due to melting sea ice). There is evidence that prior experience with hazards increases adaptation response (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barreca--2015">Barreca et al., 2015</a>). Following drought and precipitation variability, the next specific hazards that are most frequently documented in the global adaptation literature are heat and flooding. Heat, while less salient, appears to be a driver of adaptation across all regions and sectors (Stone Jr et al., 2014; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hintz--2018">Hintz et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Nunfam--2018">Nunfam et al., 2018</a>).

Investment in flood protection, including building design and monitoring and forecasting, have reduced flood-related mortality over time and are cost-effective (Bouwer and Jonkman 2018; Ward et al. 2017). Declining heat sensitivity, primarily reported in developed nations, has also been observed, and has been linked to air conditioning, reduced social vulnerability and improved population health (<a class="reference-link" href="#Boeckmann--2014">Boeckmann and Rohn, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chung--2017">Chung et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kinney--2018">Kinney, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sheridan--2018">Sheridan and Allen, 2018</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Formetta--2019">Formetta and Feyen (2019)</a> demonstrate declining global all-cause mortality and economic loss due to extreme weather events over the past four decades, with the greatest reductions in low-income countries, and with reductions correlated with wealth. Studies that correlate changes in mortality or economic losses with wealth indicators, to infer changes in vulnerability or exposure, lack direct empirical measures of vulnerability or exposure and are limited in their ability to assess how indirect effects of extreme events (e.g., morbidity, relocation, social disruption) may have changed or how changes may redistribute risk across populations.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There remain persistent difficulties in defining and measuring adaptation effectiveness and adequacy for many climate risks. No studies have systematically assessed the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation at a global scale, across nations or sectors, or for different levels of warming. There has, however, been progress in operationalising assessment of adaptation feasibility (Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18). Effectiveness of adaptation-related responses reflects whether a particular response actually reduces climate risk, typically through reductions in vulnerability and exposure (Figure 1.7 in <a class="section-link" data-title="Societal Responses to Climate Change Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-1#1.4">Section 1.4</a>). Some adaptation-related responses may increase risk or create new risks (maladaptation) or have no or negligible impact on risk. Adequacy of adaptation-related responses refers to the extent to which responses are collectively sufficient to reduce the risks or impacts of climate change (Figure 1.7 in <a class="section-link" data-title="Societal Responses to Climate Change Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-1#1.4">Section 1.4</a>). A set of adaptation-related responses may, for example, result in reduced climate risk (effectiveness), but these reductions may be insufficient to offset the level of risk and avoid loss and damages. Feasibility reflects the degree to which climate responses are possible or desirable, and integrates consideration of potential effectiveness. A feasibility assessment drawing on these methods is presented in Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Global adaptation is predominantly slow, siloed and incremental with little evidence of transformative adaptation (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>).

There is evidence that autonomous adaptation by individuals and households can shift risk to others, with net increases in vulnerability.

Tolerable risks are those where adaptation needed to keep risk within reasonable levels is possible, while intolerable risks are those where practicable or affordable adaptation options to avoid unreasonable risks are unavailable. This highlights that limits to adaptation are socially constructed and based on values that determine levels of reasonable or unreasonable risk as well as on available adaptation options, which vary greatly across and within societies.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Limits are categorised as being either ‘soft’ or ‘hard’. Soft limits may change over time as additional adaptation options that are practicable or affordable become available. Hard limits will not change over time as no additional adaptive actions are possible. When a limit is exceeded, then intolerable risk may materialise and the actor’s objectives or system’s needs may be either abandoned or transformed (Box 16.2).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">For human systems, soft and hard limits are largely distinguished by whether or not constraints to adaptation are able to be overcome. Constraints to adaptation (also called barriers) are factors that make it harder to plan and implement adaptation actions, such as limited financial resources, ineffective institutional arrangements or insufficient human capacity. Soft limits are mostly associated with human systems, due in part to the role of human agency in addressing constraints. For natural systems, the magnitude and rate of climate change and capacity of adaptation to such change largely determine the type of limit. Hard limits are largely associated with natural systems and are mostly due to inability to adapt to biophysical changes.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Using this understanding of limits, subsequent Special Reports have assessed relevant literature (<a class="reference-link" href="#Mechler--2020">Mechler et al., 2020</a>). SR15 identifies several regions, sectors and ecosystems—including coral reefs, biodiversity, human health, coastal livelihoods, Small Island Developing States, and the Arctic—that are projected to experience limits at either 1.5°C or 2°C. SRCCL states that land degradation due to climate change may result in limits to adaptation being reached in coastal regions and areas affected by thawing permafrost. SROCC details that risks of climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere may result in limits for ecosystems and vulnerable communities in coral reef environments, urban atoll islands and low-lying Arctic locations before the end of this century in case of high-emissions scenarios.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">A key area of advancement since AR5 is how incremental adaptation and transformational adaptation relate to limits to adaptation. Incremental adaptation maintains ‘the essence and integrity of a system or process at a given scale’, while transformational adaptation ‘changes the fundamental attributes of a social-ecological system’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018b">IPCC, 2018b</a>). Both incremental and transformational adaptation may expand the adaptive possibilities for a system, providing additional adaptation options after a system reaches a soft limit (<a class="reference-link" href="#Felgenhauer--2015">Felgenhauer, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pelling--2015">Pelling et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Termeer--2017">Termeer et al., 2017</a>, see also Chapters 1 and 17; <a class="reference-link" href="#Alston--2018">Alston et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Panda--2018">Panda, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mechler--2021">Mechler and Deubelli, 2021</a>). However, it is critical to note that adaptation, whether incremental or transformational, must support securing an actor’s objectives or system’s needs from intolerable risks. Once objectives or needs have been abandoned or transformed, a limit to adaptation has occurred. However, objectives or needs may change over time as values of a society change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Taebi--2020">Taebi et al., 2020</a>), thus adding further complexity to assessing limits to adaptation.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="16.4.1.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">16.4.1.2 Residual Risk since AR5<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-24-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The term ‘residual risk’ was not assessed in detail in AR5 and was used interchangeably with other terms, including ‘residual impacts’, ‘residual loss and damage’ and ‘residual damage’. SR15 includes discussion of residual risks without an explicit definition and relates these to L oss and D amage and limits to adaptation, concluding that residual risks rise as global temperatures increase from 1.5°C to 2°C. SRCCL refers to residual risks arising from limits to adaptation related to land management. Such residual risk can emerge from irreversible forms of land degradation, such as coastal erosion when land completely disappears, collapse of infrastructure due to thawing of permafrost, and extreme forms of soil erosion. SROCC advanced the conceptualisation of residual risk and integrated it within the risk framework, defining residual risk as the risk that remains after actions have been taken to reduce hazards, exposure and/or vulnerability. Residual risk is therefore generally higher where adaptation failure, insufficient adaptation or limits to adaptation occur. We use the SROCC definition of residual risk for our assessment in the following sections and identify residual risks that are associated with limits to adaptation.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container box-container" id="box-16.2"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_head" lang="en-GB"><span>Box 16.2 | Linking Adaptation Constraints, Soft and Hard Limits</span> <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></p><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-24-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">McNamara et al. (2017) provides an example of community-scaled adaptation that highlights how constraints affect limits, the relationship between soft and hard limits, and the potential need to abandon or transform objectives. Community members of Boigu Island, Australia, are already adapting to perceived climate change hazards—including sea level rise and coastal erosion—to secure their objective of sustaining livelihoods and way of life in their current location. Existing seawall and drainage systems provide inadequate protection from flooding during high tides, leading residents to elevate their houses to prevent damages. However, these adaptation measures have proved to be insufficient. Standing saltwater for extended periods of time after floods has resulted in losses and damages, including erosion of infrastructure, increased soil salinity, and heightened public health concerns. Additional adaptation efforts are constrained by scarcity of elevated land, which inhibits movement of infrastructure within the community, and lack of financial, technical and human assets to improve coastal protection measures.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">These constraints are leading to a soft limit to adaptation, where risks would become unreasonable as sea levels continue to rise and practicable and affordable adaptation options are limited to currently available approaches. This soft limit could be overcome through addressing constraints and allowing further adaptation to take place, such as providing financial, technical and human resources for more effective coastal protection and drainage systems that would reduce flooding. However, if the effectiveness of these new adaptation measures decreases as sea levels rise further and if constraints are not able to be overcome, another soft limit may be reached. Eventually, if constraints are not addressed, no further adaptation measures are implemented, and climate hazards intensify, the area could become uninhabitable. This would then be a hard limit for adaptation; there would be no adaptation options available that would allow the community to sustain livelihoods and way of life in its present location. This hard limit to adaptation may necessitate abandoning the objective of remaining in the community. The objective of the community may then transform to sustaining their livelihoods in a less vulnerable location, which would necessitate relocation. However, such transformation of the community’s objectives may be hindered by the expressed resistance of residents to migrate, due to their strong sense of place.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="16.4.2"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">16.4.2 Insights from Regions and Sectors about Limits to Adaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-12-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Here we provide example case studies to highlight constraints that may lead to soft limits, potential incremental and transformational adaptation options that may overcome soft limits, evidence of hard limits, and residual risks.</p><div class="h3-container" id="16.4.2.1"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">16.4.2.1 Small Island Developing States <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-25-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">An expanding volume of empirical research highlights existing adaptation constraints that may lead to soft limits in Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

Governance, financial and information constraints such as unclear property rights and lack of donor flexibility have led to hasty implementation of adaptation projects in Kiribati, whereas in Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands, limited awareness of rural adaptation needs and weak linkages between central governance and local communities have resulted in an urban bias in resource allocation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kuruppu--2015">Kuruppu and Willie, 2015</a>).

Native tree replanting has also been implemented, but coastal flooding and erosion persist as large swells lead to high failure rates of replanting efforts.

href="#Oppenheimer--2014">Oppenheimer et al., 2014</a>) to refine the definition of climate-related key risks (KRs) and criteria for identifying them (<a class="section-link" data-title="Defining Key Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.1">Section 16.5.1</a>), and describe a broad range of key risks by sector and region as identified by the authors of WGII AR6 (<a class="section-link" data-title="Identification and Assessment of Key Risks and Representative Key Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.2">Section 16.5.2</a>, SM16.4). Based on this, eight clusters of key risks (i.e., Representative Key Risks, RKRs) are identified and assessed in terms of the conditions under which they would become severe. In addition, the section assesses variation in KRs and RKRs by the level of global average warming, socioeconomic development pathways, and levels of adaptation, and illustrates the implications from resulting dynamics in all risk dimensions (hazard, exposure, vulnerability) along a case study of densely populated river deltas (<a class="section-link" data-title="Variation of Key Risks across Levels of Global Warming, Exposure and Vulnerability, and Adaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.3">Section 16.5.3</a>). Last, interactions among RKRs are discussed (<a class="section-link" data-title="RKR Interactions" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.4">Section 16.5.4</a>).</p></div><div class="h2-container" id="16.5.1"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">16.5.1 Defining Key Risks <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-14-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">A key risk is defined as a potentially severe risk and therefore especially relevant to the interpretation of dangerous anthropogenic interference (DAI) with the climate system, the prevention of which is the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC as stated in its Article 2 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2014">Oppenheimer et al., 2014</a>). Key risks are therefore a relevant lens for the interpretation of this policy framing. The severity of a risk is a context-specific judgement based on a number of criteria discussed below. KRs are ‘potentially’ severe because, while some could already reflect dangerous interference now, more typically they may become severe over time due to changes in the nature of hazards (or, more broadly, climatic impact drivers; <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2021">IPCC, 2021</a>) and/or of the exposure/vulnerability of societies or ecosystems to those hazards. They also may become severe due to the adverse consequences of adaptation or mitigation responses to the risk (on the former, see <a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Success and Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.5.1">Section 17.5.1</a>; the latter is not assessed separately here, except as it contributes to risks from climate hazards). Dangerous interferences in this chapter are considered over the course of the 21st century.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">KRs may be defined for a wide variety of systems at a range of scales. The broadest definition is for the global human system or planetary ecological system, but KRs may also apply to regions, specific sectors or communities, or to parts of a system rather than to the system as a whole. For example, the population at the lower end of the wealth distribution is often impacted by climate change much more severely than the rest of the population (<a class="reference-link" href="#Leichenko--2014">Leichenko and Silva, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hallegatte--2017">Hallegatte and Rozenberg, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hallegatte--2017">Hallegatte et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pelling--2019">Pelling and Garschagen, 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">KRs are determined not just by the nature of hazards, exposure, vulnerability and response options, but also by values, which determine the importance of a risk. Importance is understood here as the degree of relevance to interpreting DAI at a given system’s level or scale, and was an explicit criterion for identifying key vulnerabilities and risks in AR5 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2014">Oppenheimer et al., 2014</a>). Because values can vary across individuals, communities or cultures, as well as over time, what constitutes a KR can vary widely from the perspective of each of these groups, or across individuals. For example, ecosystems providing indirect services and cultural assets such as historic buildings and archaeological sites may be considered very important to preserve by some people but not by others; and some types of infrastructure, such as a commuter rail, may be important to the well-being of some households but less so to others. Therefore, <a class="section-link" data-title="Key risks across sectors and regions" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16">Chapter 16</a> authors do not make their own judgements about the importance of particular risks. Instead, we highlight importance as an overarching factor but identify and evaluate KRs based on four other criteria for what may be considered potentially severe.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Magnitude of adverse consequences. </span>Magnitude measures the degree to which particular dimensions of a system are affected, should the risk materialise. Magnitude can include the size or extent of the system, the <span class="condensed_italic" lang>pervasiveness of the consequences</span> across the system (geographically or in terms of affected population), as well as the <span class="condensed_italic" lang>degree of consequences</span>. Consequences can be measured by a wide range of characteristics. For example, risks to food security can be measured as uncertain consequences for food consumption, access or prices. The magnitude of these consequences would be the degree of change in these measures induced by climate change and accounting for the interaction with exposure and vulnerability. In addition to <span class="condensed_italic" lang>pervasiveness</span> and <span class="condensed_italic" lang>degree of change</span>, several other aspects can contribute to a judgement of magnitude, although they refer to concepts that are difficult to capture and highly context-specific:</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Irreversibility of consequences</span>. Consequences that are irreversible, at least over long time scales, would be considered a higher risk than those that are temporary. For example, changes to the prevailing ecosystem in a given location may not be reversible on the decade to century scale.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Potential for impact thresholds or tipping points</span>. Higher risks are posed by the potential for exceeding a threshold beyond which the magnitude or rate of an impact substantially increases.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries</span>. Higher risks are posed by those with the potential to generate downstream cascading effects to other ecosystems, sectors or population groups within the affected system and/or to another system, whether neighbouring or distant (Cross-Chapter Box INTEREG in this Chapter).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Likelihood of adverse consequences. </span>A higher probability of high-magnitude consequences poses a larger risk <span class="condensed_italic" lang>a priori</span>, whatever the scale considered. This probability may not be quantifiable, and it may be conditional on assumptions about the hazard, exposure or vulnerability associated with the risk.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Temporal characteristics of the risk. </span>Risks that occur sooner, or that increase more rapidly over time, present greater challenges to natural and societal adaptation. A persistent risk (due to the persistence of the hazard, exposure and vulnerability) may also pose a higher threat than a temporary risk due, for example, to a short-term increase in the vulnerability of a population (e.g., due to conflict or an economic downturn).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="bold_condensed" lang="en-GB">Ability to respond to the risk</span>. Risks are more severe if the affected ecosystems or societies have limited ability to reduce hazards (e.g., for human systems, through mitigation, ecosystem management and possibly solar radiation management); to reduce exposure or vulnerability through various human or ecological adaptation options; or to cope with or respond to the consequences, should they occur.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The relative influence of these different criteria is case-specific and left to author judgement in the identification of KRs (groups of authors in regional and sectoral chapters) and the assessment of representative key risks (author teams, see SM16.4).

Authors were asked to rely on the above definition and criteria to identify risks that could potentially become severe according to changes in the associated hazards, the study systems’ exposure and/or vulnerability, and important adaptation strategies that could reduce these risks (see SM16.3 for methodology). Wherever possible, identification is based on literature that includes projected future conditions for all three components of risk and adaptation. Where literature was insufficient, potential severity is based on current vulnerability and exposure to climate hazards and the expectation that hazards will increase in frequency and/or intensity in the future. This approach is more limited in that it does not consider future changes in exposure and vulnerability nor in adaptation, but has the benefit of being grounded in observed experience.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Table SM16.24 indicates that climate change presents a wide range of risks across scales, sectors and regions that could become severe under particular conditions of hazards, exposure and vulnerability, which may or may not occur. Some illustrations of the extent and diversity of KRs are provided here, and more detailed assessment can be found in the Chapters referenced in the table.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Global-scale KRs include threats to biodiversity in oceans, coastal regions and on land, particularly in biodiversity hotspots, as well as other ecological risks such as geographic shifts in vegetation, tree mortality, reduction in populations and reduction in growth (such as for shellfish). These ecological risks include cascading impacts on livelihoods and food security. Global-scale risks also include risks to people, property and infrastructure from river flooding and extreme heat (particularly in urban areas), risks to fisheries (with implications for living standards and food security) and some health risks from food-borne diseases as well as psychopathologies.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Many KRs are especially prominent in particular regions or systems, or for particular subgroups of the population. For example, coastal systems and small islands are a nexus of many KRs, including those to ecosystems and their services, especially coral reefs; people (health, livelihoods); and assets, including infrastructure. Risks to socio-ecological systems in polar regions are also identified as KRs, as are ecological risks to the Amazon Forest in South America and savannahs in Africa. For some regions, risks from wildfire are of particular concern, including in Australasia and North America. Vector-borne diseases are a particular concern in Africa and Asia. Loss of cultural heritage is identified as a KR in small islands, mountain regions, Africa, Australasia and North America.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">For many risks, low-income populations are particularly vulnerable to KRs. Climate-related impacts on malnutrition and other forms of food insecurity will be larger for this group, along with small-holder farming households and Indigenous communities reliant on agriculture, and for women, children, the elderly and the socially isolated (<a class="section-link" data-title="Food Security, Consumption and Nutrition" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-5#5.12">Section 5.12</a>). KRs in coastal communities are expected to affect low-income populations more strongly, including through risks to livelihoods of those reliant on coastal fisheries. KRs related to health are generally higher for low-income populations less likely to have adequate housing or access to infrastructure.</p></div></div><div class="h3-container" id="16.5.2.2"><h3 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">16.5.2.2 Identification of Representative Key Risks <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h3><div class="h3-siblings" id="h3-32-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">As in AR5 <a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2014">Oppenheimer et al. (2014)</a>, major clusters of KRs are further analysed, and here referred to as ‘representative key risks’ (RKRs). RKRs were defined in a three-step process (SM16.3.1). First, half of <a class="section-link" data-title="Key risks across sectors and regions" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16">Chapter 16</a> authors independently mapped the KRs (SM16.7.4) to a set of candidate RKRs. Second, all <a class="section-link" data-title="Key risks across sectors and regions" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16">Chapter 16</a> authors discussed the set of independent results and proposed a list of RKRs, considering scope and overlap. Third, this proposal was discussed with a consultative group of about 20 WGII AR6 authors from other chapters closely involved in the KR identification process, and a final list of eight RKRs was identified (Table 16.6).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The RKRs are intended to capture the widest variety of KRs to human or ecological systems with a small number of categories that are easier to communicate and provide a manageable structure for further assessment. They expand the scope of some AR5 KR clusters (e.g., on coasts, health, food and water) and add new ones (e.g., on peace and human mobility). The RKRs encompass a diversity of types of systems, including an example of a geographically defined system (RKR<span class="condensed_italic" lang>-</span>A<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> on coastal regions), ecosystem well-being and integrity (RKR<span class="condensed_italic" lang>-</span>B), a cross-cutting issue relevant to several outcomes of concern (RKR-C<span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> on critical infrastructure) and several topics focused directly on aspects of human well-being and security (RKR<span class="condensed_italic" lang>-</span>D to RKR<span class="condensed_italic" lang>-</span>H). This set of RKRs manages but does not eliminate overlap, instead providing alternative perspectives on underlying key risks that sometimes include complementary views on common risks. For example, the water security RKR highlights the many key risks mediated by water quantity or quality, which are sometimes manifested as risk to food security (RKR-F) or health (RKR-E).</p><p class="Body_Tables_Table_title" lang="en-US"><span class="table_number" lang>Table 16.6 | </span>Climate-related representative key risks (RKRs).

The following subsections describe the scope of the category of risk (underlying KR considered) and the approach to defining ‘severe’ risks for each particular RKR. They also assess the conditions in terms of warming (more broadly, climatic impact drivers; (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ranasinghe--2021">Ranasinghe et al., 2021</a>), exposure/vulnerability and adaptation under which the RKR would become severe. For each of these dimensions, RKR teams considered generic levels ranging from High to Medium and Low. For warming levels, in line with WGI framing, High refers to climate outcomes consistent with RCP8.5 or higher, Low refers to climate outcomes consistent with RCP2.6 or lower, and Medium refers to outcomes for scenarios between RCPs 2.6 and 8.5. For reference, the full range of warming levels (across all climate models) associated with RCP8.5 for the 2081–2100 period is 3.0–6.2°C; for RCP2.6 it is 0.9–2.3°C; and for intermediate RCPs it is 1.8–3.6°C (Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE in Chapter 1). For Exposure-Vulnerability, levels are determined by the RKR teams relative to the range of future conditions considered in the literature, for example based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) in which future conditions based on SSPs 1 or 5 represent Low exposure or vulnerability and those based on SSPs 3 or 4 represent High exposure or vulnerability (<a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2014">O’Neill et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#van%20Vuuren--2014">van Vuuren and Carter, 2014</a>). For Adaptation, two main levels have been considered: High refers to near maximum potential, and Low refers to the continuation of today’s trends. Despite being intertwined in reality, Exposure-Vulnerability and Adaptation conditions are distinguished to help understand their respective contributions to risk severity. Importantly, this assessment does not consider all risks, but only those that can be considered severe given the definition and criteria presented in <a class="section-link" data-title="Defining Key Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.1">Section 16.5.1</a>. The assessment does not exclude the possibility that severe risks are already observed in some contexts, and considers projected risks through the end of this century.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Each RKR assessment followed a common set of guidelines (SM16.3) that included broad criteria for defining severity (<a class="section-link" data-title="Defining Key Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.1">Section 16.5.1</a>), consideration of complex risks and interactions within and across RKRs, and consideration of risks across a range of scales, regions, and ecological and human development contexts. The specific definition of severity within each RKR was determined by the author teams of that assessment, applying different combinations of key risk criteria and metrics as judged appropriate in each case. Definitions are transparent and use common criteria, but are nonetheless based on the respective author team’s judgement. Conclusions about severity and associated confidence statements are therefore conditional on those definitions.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Assessments are based on different types of evidence depending on the nature of the literature. In some cases, quantitative projections of potential impacts are available. In others and as for KR identification, the potential for severe risk is inferred from high levels of current vulnerability and the expectation that the relevant climate hazards (climatic impact drivers, CIDs) will increase in frequency or intensity in the future.</p></div><div class="h4-container" id="16.5.2.3.1"><h4 class="Headings_H3" lang="de-DE">16.5.2.3.1 Risk to the integrity of low-lying coastal socio-ecological systems (RKR-A)<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h4><div class="h4-siblings" id="h3-34-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">RKR-A considers climate-change-related risks to low-lying coasts including their physical, ecological and human components.

It highlights risks to (i) natural coastal protection and habitats; (ii) lives, livelihoods, culture and well-being; and (iii) critical physical infrastructure; it therefore overlaps with several other RKRs (Figures 16.10, 16.11) but within a coastal focus.

Accordingly, a qualitative range of consequences is presented here, in place of a quantitative global severe risk threshold.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The literature suggests that severe risks generally occur at the nexus of high levels and rates of anthropogenic-driven change in climate hazards (<a class="section-link" data-title="Water Distribution—River Flooding and Reduction in Water Availability" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.2.3.2">Section 16.2.3.2</a>), concentrations of people and tangible and intangible assets, non-climate hazards such as sediment mining and ecosystem degradation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Warm-Water Coral Reefs" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-3#3.4.2.1">Section 3.4.2.1</a>), and the reaching of adaptation limits (<a class="section-link" data-title="Synthesis of Limits to Adaptation across Natural and Human Systems" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.4">Section 16.4</a>) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>).

Severity in this RKR is assessed on two levels for (i) direct impacts of climate change on infrastructure assets and networks (e.g., amount of port infrastructure damaged or destroyed by SLR, flooding and storms) on which most of the literature focuses, as well as (ii) indirect and cascading downstream impacts to people, economy and environment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Markolf--2019">Markolf et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pyatkova--2019">Pyatkova et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chester--2020">Chester et al., 2020</a>), for which attribution is more difficult and uncertainties tend to be much higher. Overall, the literature with quantified assessments of climate change infrastructure risks remains to be less extensive than for many other risks, particularly with regard to assessments focusing on the Global South.

Under RCP8.5, the number of ports under high risk will increase from 3.8% in the present day to 14.4% by 2100, as a result of increased coastal flooding and overtopping due to SLR, as well as the heat stress impacts of higher temperatures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Izaguirre--2021">Izaguirre et al., 2021</a>).

A global assessment of changing climate and water resources for electricity generation finds considerable reductions in usable hydropower and thermoelectric capacity by 2050 for a range of warming scenarios from Low to High, with absolute declines on average for most (61–74%) of the world’s hydropower resources and monthly maximum reductions above 30% of usable capacity for over two-thirds of 1427 thermoelectric power plants worldwide (<a class="reference-link" href="#Van%20Vliet--2016">Van Vliet et al., 2016</a>).

Severity in this context is defined as the potential to disrupt the lives, livelihoods and well-being of a significantly increased proportion of the population and to significantly forestall economic growth and development potential. Global risks to air travel from SLR, expressed in terms of expected annual route disruptions, could increase by a factor of between 17 and 69 by 2100 under the 1.5°C and the 95th percentile value of the RCP8.5 SLR scenario, respectively (<a class="reference-link" href="#Yesudian--2021">Yesudian and Dawson, 2021</a>).

Next to the limited number of projections or scenarios of indirect impacts, additional inferences from studies focusing on past and current impacts can be drawn. Already today, climate-related impacts on transport and energy infrastructure reach far beyond the direct impacts on physical infrastructure, triggering indirect impacts on, for example, health and income (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>).

In these vulnerable populations, even a small percentage increase can lead to substantial additional morbidity and mortality.

The timing of these impacts and our ability to respond to them vary based on the level of GHG emissions and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP).. Under a low vulnerability development pathway (SSP1), climate change starts posing a moderate risk to food security above 1°C of global warming (i.e., impacts become detectable and attributable to climate-related factors), while beyond 2.5°C the risk becomes high (widespread impacts on larger numbers or proportion of population or area, but with the potential to adapt or recover) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hurlbert--2019">Hurlbert et al., 2019</a>).

Water security risks are a combination of water-related hazards such as floods, droughts and water quality deterioration, and exposure of vulnerable groups exposed to too little, too much or contaminated water. Reasons for these can include both environmental conditions and issues of safety and access influenced by effectiveness of water governance (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sadoff--2020">Sadoff et al., 2020</a>). These are manifest through loss of lives, property, livelihoods and culture, and impacts on human health and nutrition, ecosystems and water-related conflicts which in turn can drive forced human displacement.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This RKR focuses on three types of risks with the potential to become severe: those associated with water scarcity, those driven by water-related disasters, and those impacting indigenous and traditional cultures and ways of life. Risk to water security constitutes a potentially severe risk because climate change could impact the hydrologic cycle in ways that would lead to substantial consequences for the health, livelihoods, property and cultures of large numbers of people. For those associated with water scarcity, ‘severe’ refers to magnitude (number of people in areas where water scarcity falls below recognised thresholds for adequate water supply per capita), along with the likelihood of unforeseen increases in water scarcity that outpace the ability to prepare for the increased risk by putting in place new large-scale infrastructure within the required time scale. For those associated with extreme events, ‘severe’ refers to magnitude (numbers of people affected, including deaths, physical health impacts including disease, mental health impacts, loss of livelihoods, loss of or damage to property) and timing (e.g., events coinciding with other stresses, e.g., a pandemic occurring at a time when local infrastructures are weakened by an extreme weather event). Important water-related extreme events include river flooding caused by heavy and/or prolonged rainfall, glacial lake outburst floods, and droughts. For those impacting cultures, ‘severe’ refers to the loss of key aspects of traditional ways of life. This includes consequences of the above two KRs.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Risks associated with water scarcity have the potential to become severe based on projections of large numbers of people becoming exposed to low levels of water availability per person, where ‘water availability’ includes fresh water in the landscape, including soil moisture and streamflows, available for all uses including agriculture as a dominant sector. Approximately 1.6 billion people currently experience ‘chronic’ water scarcity, defined as the availability of less than 1000 m <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>3</span> of renewable sources of fresh water per person per year (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gosling--2016">Gosling and Arnell, 2016</a>). In this context, we define a severe outcome as an additional 1 billion people experiencing ‘chronic’ water scarcity, relating to all uses of water, representing an increase of a magnitude comparable to current levels. The global number of people experiencing chronic water scarcity is projected to increase by approximately 800 million to 3 billion for 2°C global warming, and up to approximately 4 billion for 4°C global warming, considering the effects of climate change alone, with a 9 billion population (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gosling--2016">Gosling and Arnell, 2016</a>). Severe outcomes are projected to occur even with no changes in exposure: present-day exposure is defined here as ‘medium’ since either an increase or decrease in exposure could be possible. Vulnerability is not quantified in the literature assessed here, so in this assessment it is considered that severe outcomes could occur with present-day levels of vulnerability, again defined here as ‘medium’. Particularly severe outcomes (i.e., the high end of these ranges) are driven by regional patterns of climate change bringing severe reductions in precipitation and/or high levels of evapotranspiration in the most highly populated regions, leading to very substantial reductions in water availability compared with demand. There is strong consensus across models that water scarcity is projected to increase across substantial parts of the world even though projections disagree on which specific areas would see this impact. Moreover, a projected decrease in water scarcity in some regions does not prevent the increase in water scarcity in other regions becoming severe. Hence there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> that risks to water scarcity have the potential to become severe due to climate change. Consequences of water scarcity include potential competition and conflicts between water users (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vanham--2018">Vanham et al., 2018</a>), damaging livelihoods, hindering socioeconomic development and reducing human well-being, for example through malnutrition resulting from inadequate water supplies leading to long-term health impacts such as child stunting (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cooper--2019">Cooper et al., 2019</a>). The avoidance of these consequences at high levels of water scarcity would require transformational adaptations including large-scale interventions such as dams and water transfer infrastructure (<a class="reference-link" href="#Greve--2018">Greve et al., 2018</a>). Since these require many years or even decades for planning and construction, and are also costly and irreversible and can potentially lead to lock-in and maladaptation, the potential for inadequate policy decisions made in the context of high uncertainties in regional climate changes brings the risk of a shortfall in adaptation. Around 2050, at approximately 2°C global warming, the risk of a substantial adaptation shortfall and hence severe outcomes for water scarcity have a relatively high likelihood across large parts of the southern USA and Mexico, northern Africa, parts of the Middle-East, northern China, and southern Australia, as well as many parts of Northwest India and Pakistan (<a class="reference-link" href="#Greve--2018">Greve et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Risks associated with water-related extreme events and disasters have the potential to become severe based on projections of large numbers of people or high values of assets being affected. The risks to people from disasters can often only be quantified in terms of the hazard and exposure (the number of people affected), rather than the full consequences such as number of deaths, injuries or other health outcomes, as these often depend on complex or unpredictable factors such as the effectiveness of emergency and humanitarian responses or the access to healthcare. With approximately 50 million people per year currently affected by flooding (<a class="reference-link" href="#Alfieri--2017">Alfieri et al., 2017</a>), we define severe outcomes as more than 100 million people affected by flooding. At 2°C global warming, between approximately 50 million and 150 million people are projected to be affected by flooding, with figures rising to 110 million to 330 million at 4°C global warming. These projections assume present-day population and no additional adaptation, so no changes in exposure. Increased flood risk is projected by the WHO to lead to an additional 48,000 deaths of children under 15 years due to diarrhoea by 2030, with Sub-Saharan Africa impacted the most (<a class="reference-link" href="#WHO--2014">WHO, 2014</a>). Other consequences of floods that already occur include deaths by drowning, loss of access to fresh water, vector-borne diseases, mental health impacts, loss of livelihoods and loss of or damage to property. Many of these consequences depend on the vulnerability of individuals, households or communities to flooding impacts, for example through the presence or absence of measures to safeguard health and livelihoods, such as through infrastructure services, insurance or community support. The risks associated with these consequences could increase if there were no local adaptations to counter the effect of increased levels of hazard by reducing exposure and/or vulnerability. Climate-related changes to extreme events that would lead to these severe outcomes include increased frequency and/or magnitude of river floods of flash floods due to heavy or long-lasting precipitation, rapid snowmelt, or catastrophic failure of glacial lake moraine dams. These climate conditions are projected to increase with global warming.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Risks to cultural uses of water can become severe if there is permanent loss of aspects of communities’ cultures due to changes in water, including loss of areas of ice or snow with spiritual meanings, loss of culturally important places of access to such places, and loss of culturally important subsistence practices including by Indigenous People (Chapter 4). This includes mountain regions where changes in the cryosphere are having profound impacts (Cross-Chapter Paper 5). In these cases, severe outcomes would be defined locally rather than globally. Communities that lost a dominant environmental characteristic deeply associated with its cultural identity would be considered to be severely impacted. For example, due to the central role that travel on sea ice plays in the life of Inuit communities, providing freedom and mental well-being, loss of sea ice can be argued to represent environmental dispossession of these communities (<a class="reference-link" href="#Durkalec--2015">Durkalec et al., 2015</a>). Traditional ways of life are therefore threatened, and resulting changes would be transformative rather than adaptive. Similarly, changes in streamflow affecting the availability of species for traditional hunting can also negatively impact Indigenous communities (Norton-Smith et al.). Such changes are already being seen at current levels of warming, but studies remain somewhat limited in number, so this assessment is assigned <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span> because of <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span> and medium agreement. WGI conclude that it is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>virtually certain</span> that further warming will lead to further reductions in Northern Hemisphere snow cover, and mass loss in individual glacier regions is projected to be between approximately 30% and 100% by 2100 under high-warming scenarios (Chapter 4). Streamflows are projected to change in most major river basins worldwide by several tens of percent at 4°C global warming (Chapter 4).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">There is strong potential for increases in water scarcity, flooding, loss of snow and ice and changes in water bodies to lead to severe outcomes such as deaths from water-related diseases, drowning and starvation, long-term health impacts arising from malnutrition and diseases, loss of property, loss of existence or access to places of cultural significance, loss of livelihoods and loss of aspects of culture especially for Indigenous People with traditional lifestyles. The numbers of people affected are projected to range from hundreds of millions to several billion, depending on the level of global warming and socioeconomic futures. A key aspect of the risk is the high uncertainty in future regional precipitation changes in many regions of high vulnerability, including the potential for large and highly impactful changes, for which it may not be possible to provide adaptation measures before they become needed, leading to a high likelihood of adaptation deficits.</p></div></div><div class="h4-container" id="16.5.2.3.8"><h4 class="Headings_H4" lang="de-DE">16.5.2.3.8 Risks to peace and to human mobility (RKR-H)<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h4><div class="h4-siblings" id="h4-12-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">This RKR includes risks to peace within and among societies from armed conflict as well as risks to human mobility, epitomised by involuntary migration and displacement within and across state borders and involuntary immobility.

A severe impact is when a large share of an affected population is forcibly displaced or prevented from moving, relative to normal mobility patterns, at local to global scale.

In other words, climate risk is not a matter of changing CIDs only, but of the confrontation between changing CIDs and changing socio-ecological conditions.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In most of the RKRs, severe risk for broadly applicable situations requires high levels of warming or exposure/vulnerability, or low adaptation. In many cases, it is associated with several of these conditions occurring simultaneously (e.g., high warming and high vulnerability). Examples include low-lying coastal areas (RKR-A; <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>), loss of livelihoods (RKR-D; <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>) or armed conflicts (RKR-H; <span class="condensed_italic" lang>low confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">High warming and exposure/vulnerability combined with low adaptation is, however, not necessarily required to lead to severe risk, and various other sets of conditions can lead to such an outcome. For example:</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Without high levels of warming</span>. T his is especially the case for terrestrial and marine ecosystems (RKR-B) and water security (RKR-G) for which even medium to low levels of warming will generate severe risk, depending on the processes considered (e.g., mass population-level mortality and ecological disruption for ecosystems). This is also the case when more specific situations are considered, for example in the case of (in)voluntary mobility of vulnerable populations with limited resources (RKR-H), and for some critical infrastructure in already highly exposed and vulnerable contexts (RKR-C).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>With high levels of adaptation. </span>H igh levels of adaptation will not necessarily avoid severe risk, as is illustrated by the cases of coral-dependent and arctic coastal communities (RKR-A), some terrestrial and marine ecosystems (RKR-B), and water scarcity and the cultural uses of water (RKR-G).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">All RKR assessments indicate that risks are higher in high-vulnerability development pathways, and in some cases high vulnerability can occur in high-income societies. Examples include the possibility of increasing coastal settlement and the location of critical infrastructure in highly exposed locations (RKR-A, RKR-C), including to floods (RKR-G) and risks to terrestrial and marine ecosystems (RKR-B). The assessment therefore shows that, depending on socioeconomic trends especially in terms of equity, social justice and income sustainability, as well as on the ability to shift towards more climate-resilient economic and settlement systems (e.g., at the coast), higher-income societies also are at serious risk of being substantially affected in the decades to century to come.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In terms of the time frames, most of the RKRs conclude that severe risks to many dimensions (ecosystems, health, etc.) are expected to occur by the end of the 21st century and across the globe. Some RKRs, however, highlight that severe risk could occur far earlier, for example as soon as a warming level of 1.5°C or 2°C is reached, which means potentially well before mid-century (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2021">IPCC, 2021</a>).

Similarly, global crop prices are more than three times more sensitive to alternative assumptions about changes in production technologies and demand than to alternative climate outcomes (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ren--2016">Ren et al., 2016</a>). Future water scarcity is driven mainly by both demographic change and socioeconomic changes affecting water demand and management. A measure of between-country inequality (Gini coefficient) would decline by more than 50% this century in low-vulnerability conditions, but would double in a high-vulnerability future (<a class="reference-link" href="#Crespo%20Cuaresma--2017">Crespo Cuaresma, 2017</a>), outweighing the effect of climate (<a class="reference-link" href="#Taconet--2020">Taconet et al., 2020</a>).

The global cost of SLR over the 21st century can be lowered by factor of two to four if local cost–benefit decisions consider migration an adaptation option, in addition to hard protection (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lincke--2021">Lincke and Hinkel, 2021</a>). Under a low-warming scenario, it is estimated that adaptation (i.e., changes in crop variety and planting dates) could reduce the total number of people at risk of hunger globally by about 4%, and by about 10% in a high-warming scenario (<a class="reference-link" href="#Hasegawa--2014">Hasegawa et al., 2014</a>).

For example, the future disease burden of malaria is likely to be highly dependent on the future development of health services, deployment of malaria programs and adaptation. Investments in water and sanitation infrastructure are also recognised to have the potential to reduce severe risks of waterborne disease, although these improvements likely need to provide transformative change (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cumming--2019">Cumming et al., 2019</a>).

The most important hazards include SLR, inundation, salinity intrusion, cyclones, storms and erosion, many of which occur in combination. The potential for flooding and inundation depends on the relative sea level rise (RSLR) which results from global and regional SLR as well as local subsidence within the deltas. Subsidence caused by natural and human drivers (mainly compaction and groundwater extraction) is currently the most important cause for RSLR in many deltas and can exceed the rate of climate-induced SLR by an order of magnitude (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2019">Oppenheimer et al., 2019</a>). But in higher warming scenarios the relative importance of climate-driven SLR is expected to increase over time (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2019">Oppenheimer et al., 2019</a>).

In the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, one of the main rice-producing deltas globally, salinity intrusion has been observed to extend around 15 km inland during the rainy season and around 50 km during the dry season (<a class="reference-link" href="#Gugliotta--2017">Gugliotta et al., 2017</a>), resulting in rice yield losses of up to 4 t ha <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>−1</span> yr <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>−1</span> (<a class="reference-link" href="#Khat--2018">Khat et al., 2018</a>). SLR, along with the expansion of dams and dry season irrigation upstream, is expected to further increase the salinity intrusion into the delta. This creates additional risk for food production as rice and other crops might be pushed beyond their adaptation limits in terms of salt tolerance, potentially affecting many of the 282,000 agriculture-based livelihoods in the Mekong Delta and increasing the pressure for cost-intensive adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smajgl--2015">Smajgl et al., 2015</a>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Genua-Olmedo--2016">Genua-Olmedo et al.

In 2017, 339 million people lived in deltas with a high exposure to flooding, cyclones and other coastal hazards (<a class="reference-link" href="#Edmonds--2020">Edmonds et al., 2020</a>). Over 40% of the global population exposed to flooding from tropical cyclones lived in deltas, more than 90% of which in developing countries and emerging economies (ibid.). Looking into the future, population in low-elevation coastal zones is expected to increase by 2050 across all SSPs with diverging developments in the second half of the century, and at the end of the century will reach well over 1 billion people in SSP3 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2016">Jones and O’Neill, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Merkens--2016">Merkens et al., 2016</a>). A major part of this population is expected to reside in deltas with large cities or mega-urban agglomerations such as the Pearl River Delta, China. One of the first studies using the SSP-RCP framework on the delta scale suggests a strong increase in intensive agricultural land by the middle of the century in three SSPs (2, 3, 5) in the Volta Delta, Ghana, while the Mahanadi, India, and the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna do not show a significant further increase (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kebede--2018">Kebede et al., 2018</a>).

However, only a few studies model or dynamically assess trends in vulnerability, particularly for the future, at global scale, or take a comparative approach.

This then translates into implications not only for biodiversity but also for natural resources that support livelihoods, which will in turn affect food security (especially food availability; RKR-F), water security (especially access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water; RKR-G) and the living standards of already vulnerable groups and aggregate economic outputs at the global level (RKR-D). CIDs (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2021">IPCC, 2021</a>) will also directly affect infrastructure that are critical to ensure some basic conditions for economies to function (RKR-C), for example through transportation within and outside the country, energy production and international trade. Such disturbances to socioecological systems and economies pose climate-related risks to human health (RKR-E) as well as to peace and human mobility (RKR-H). Indeed, while health is concerned with direct influence of climate change, for example through hotter air temperatures impacting morbidity and mortality or the spatial distribution of disease vectors such as mosquitos, it is also at risk of being stressed by direct and secondary climate impacts on living standards, food security and water security (RKR-D, RKR-F, RKR-G, respectively). Increased poverty, increased hunger and limited access to drinkable water are well-known drivers of poor health conditions. The role of impact cascades is even more prominent in the case of peace and human mobility (RKR-H), even though the scientific literature does not conclude on any clear and direct climate influence on armed conflict and human migration. Rather, climate-induced degradation of natural resources that are vital for subsistence agriculture and fisheries, transformational and long-term consequences on livelihoods (e.g., new risks, increasing precarious living conditions, gendered inequity, etc.), and erosion of social capital due to exacerbated tension within and between communities are considered among the main drivers of armed conflicts and forced displacement, therefore highlighting links with water security (RKR-G) and living standards (RKR-D), for example.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">RKR assessments also suggest that some feedback effects are at work (arrows moving from the right to the left in panel A) that contribute to the potentially long-lasting effects of climate risks. RKR-H assessment, for example, states that there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>robust evidence</span> that major armed conflicts routinely trigger mass displacement, threaten health and food security, and undermine economic activity and livelihoods, often with lasting negative consequences for living standards and socioeconomic development, therefore linking back to risks to living standards (RKR-D), human health (RKR-E) and food security (RKR-F).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB"><span class="condensed_italic" lang="en-US">Interactions at the KR level</span><span lang="en-US"> (Figure 16.11, panel B)—panel B illustrates risk connections at the Key Risk level (<a class="section-link" data-title="Identification of Key Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.2.1">Section 16.5.2.1</a>) and as described in RKR assessments (<a class="section-link" data-title="Assessment of Representative Key Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.2.3">Section 16.5.2.3</a>). To only take one example here, risk to livelihoods and economies is influenced by the loss of ecosystem services (RKR-B) and the loss or breakdown of critical infrastructures (RKR-C), and it influences risks to human lives and health (RKR-E), food and water security (RKR-F, RKR-G), poverty (RKR-D) and peace and human mobility (RKR-H).

The extent and duration of risk cascades are, however, expected to substantially vary depending on warming levels and development pathways, both separately (<a class="section-link" data-title="Variation of Key Risks across Levels of Global Warming, Exposure and Vulnerability, and Adaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.3">Section 16.5.3</a>) and when combined (Sections 16.6.1, 16.6.2) (Figure 16.10).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In addition, RKR assessments converge to suggest that regions that are already experiencing climate change impacts will experience severe impact cascades first (e.g., RKR-F), because they are in areas (i) that face development constraints and associated challenges such as poverty, inequity and social discrimination for example, and (ii) where climate change projections are the most intense for the next decades. That is especially a concern for Africa (RKR-F, RKR-G), Asia and Latin America (Chapters 9, 10, 12). RKR-E, for example, concludes that the likelihood of severe risks to human health is especially high for highly susceptible populations, particularly the poor and otherwise marginalised. RKR assessments, however, emphasise that middle- and high-income regions are also to be considered at serious risk because climate change is accelerating at the global level (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2021">IPCC, 2021</a>), and because critical dimensions are exposed to severe risks such as major transportation (e.g., international airports) and energy (e.g., nuclear power plants) infrastructure for instance (RKR-C), and because of the interconnectedness of economies.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Finally, all RKR assessments suggest that enhanced adaptation has the potential to contain such feedback effects and cascading processes more broadly, and reduce the duration of the impacts on the system as a whole.

A number of SRM options have been proposed, including: stratospheric aerosol interventions (SAI), marine cloud brightening (MCB), ground-based albedo modifications (GBAM) and ocean albedo change (OAC). Although not strictly a form of SRM, cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) has been proposed to cool the planet by increasing the escape of longwave thermal radiation to space and is included here for consistency with previous assessments (<a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Coninck--2018">de Coninck et al., 2018</a>). SAI is the most-researched proposal. Modelling studies show SRM could reduce surface temperatures and potentially ameliorate some climate change risks (with more confidence for SAI than other options), but SRM could also introduce a range of new risks.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span> in the literature that for addressing climate change risks SRM cannot be the main policy response to climate change and is, at best, a supplement to achieving sustained net zero or net negative CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span> emission levels globally (<a class="reference-link" href="#de%20Coninck--2018">de Coninck et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#MacMartin--2018">MacMartin et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Buck--2020">Buck et al., 2020</a>; National Academies of Sciences and Medicine, 2021b). SRM contrasts with climate change mitigation activities, such as emission reductions and carbon dioxide removal (CDR), as it introduces a ‘mask’ to the climate change problem by altering the Earth’s radiation budget, rather than attempting to address the root cause of the problem, which is the increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. In addition, the effects of proposed SRM options would only last as long as a deployment is maintained—for example, requiring ca. yearly injection of aerosols in the case of SAI as the lifetime of aerosols in the stratosphere is 1–3 years (<a class="reference-link" href="#Niemeier--2011">Niemeier et al., 2011</a>) or continuous spraying of sea salt in the case of MCB as the lifetime of sea salt aerosols in the atmosphere is only about 10 d—which contrasts with the long lifetime of CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span> and its climate effects, with global warming resulting from CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span> emissions <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> remaining at a similar level for a hundred years or more (<a class="reference-link" href="#MacDougall--2020">MacDougall et al., 2020</a>) and long-term climate effects of emitted CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span> remaining for several hundreds to thousands of years (<a class="reference-link" href="#Solomon--2009">Solomon et al., 2009</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H2" lang="en-GB">Which scenarios?</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">The choice of SRM deployment scenarios and reference scenarios is crucial in assessment of SRM risks and its effectiveness in attenuating climate change risks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Keith--2015">Keith and MacMartin, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Honegger--2021">Honegger et al., 2021</a>).

Each scenario presents different levels and distributions of SRM benefits, side effects and risks. The more intense the SRM deployment, the larger is the likelihood for the risks of side effects and environmental risks (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Heutel--2018">Heutel et al., 2018</a>). Regional disparities in climate hazards may result from both regionally deployed SRM options such as GBAM, and more globally uniform SRM such as SAI (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2018a">Jones et al., 2018a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2018b">Seneviratne et al., 2018b</a>).

Modelling studies have shown SRM has the potential to offset some effects of increasing GHGs on global and regional climate, including the increase in frequency and intensity of extremes of temperature and precipitation, melting of Arctic sea ice and mountain glaciers, weakening of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, changes in frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones, and decrease in soil moisture (WGI, Chapter 4). However, while SRM may be effective in alleviating anthropogenic climate warming either locally or globally, it would neither maintain the climate in its present-day state nor return the climate to a pre-industrial state (climate averaged over 1850–1900, see WGI Chapter 1, Box 1.2) in all regions and in all seasons even when used to fully offset the global mean warming (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (WGI Chapter 4). This is because the climate forcing and response to SRM options are different from the forcing and response to GHG increase. Because of these differences in climate forcing and response patterns, the regional and seasonal climates of a world with a global mean warming of 1.5°C or 2°C achieved via SRM would be different from a world with similar global mean warming but achieved through mitigation (MacMartin et al.., 2019). At the regional scale and seasonal time scale, there could be considerable residual climate change and/or overcompensating change (e.g., more cooling, wetting or drying than just what is needed to offset warming, drying or wetting due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions), and there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>low confidence</span> in understanding of the climate response to SRM at the regional scale (WGI, Chapter 4).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">SAI implemented to partially offset warming (e.g., offsetting half of global warming) may have potential to ameliorate hazards in multiple regions and reduce negative residual change, such as drying compared with present-day climate, that is associated with fully offsetting global mean warming (<a class="reference-link" href="#Irvine--2020">Irvine and Keith, 2020</a>), but may also increase flood and drought risk in Europe compared with unmitigated warming (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jones--2021">Jones et al., 2021</a>). Recent modelling studies suggest it is conceptually possible to meet multiple climate objectives through optimally designed SRM strategies (WGI, Chapter 4). Nevertheless, large uncertainties still exist for climate processes associated with SRM options (e.g., aerosol–cloud–radiation interaction) (WGI, Chapter 4) (<a class="reference-link" href="#Kravitz--2020">Kravitz and MacMartin, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Compared with climate hazards, many fewer studies have examined SRM risks—the potential adverse consequences to people and ecosystems from the combination of climate hazards, exposure and vulnerability—or the potential for SRM to reduce risk (<a class="reference-link" href="#Curry--2014">Curry et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Irvine--2017">Irvine et al., 2017</a>). Risk analyses have often used inputs from climate models forced with stylised representations of SRM, such as dimming the sun. Fewer have used inputs from climate models that explicitly simulated injection of gases or aerosols into the atmosphere, which include more complex cloud radiative feedbacks. Most studies have used scenarios where SAI is deployed to hold average global temperature constant despite high emissions.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>low confidence</span> and large uncertainty in projected impacts of SRM on crop yields due in part to a limited number of studies. Because SRM would result in only a slight reduction in CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span> concentrations relative to the emission scenario without SRM (Chapter 5, WGI), the CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span> fertilisation effect on plant productivity is nearly the same in emissions scenarios with and without SRM. Nevertheless, changes in climate due to SRM are likely to have some impacts on crop yields. A single study indicates MCB may reduce crop failure rates compared with climate change from a doubling of CO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1" lang>2</span> pre-industrial concentrations (<a class="reference-link" href="#Parkes--2015">Parkes et al., 2015</a>). Models suggest SAI cooling would reduce crop productivity at higher latitudes compared with a scenario without SRM by reducing the growing season length, but benefit crop productivity in lower latitudes by reducing heat stress (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pongratz--2012">Pongratz et al., 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Xia--2014">Xia et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Zhan--2019">Zhan et al., 2019</a>). Crop productivity is also projected to be reduced where SAI reduces rainfall relative to the scenario without SRM, including a case where reduced Asian summer monsoon rainfall causes a reduction in groundnut yields (<a class="reference-link" href="#Xia--2014">Xia et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yang--2016">Yang et al., 2016</a>). SAI will increase the fraction of diffuse sunlight, which is projected to increase photosynthesis in forested canopy, but will reduce the direct and total available sunlight, which tends to reduce photosynthesis. As total sunlight is reduced, there is a net reduction in crop photosynthesis with the result that any benefits to crops from avoided heat stress may be offset by reduced photosynthesis, as indicated by a single statistical modelling study (<a class="reference-link" href="#Proctor--2018">Proctor et al., 2018</a>). SAI would reduce average surface ozone concentration (<a class="reference-link" href="#Xia--2017">Xia et al., 2017</a>) mainly as a result of aerosol-induced reduction in stratospheric ozone in polar regions, resulting in reduced downward transport of ozone to the troposphere (<a class="reference-link" href="#Pitari--2014">Pitari et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tilmes--2018">Tilmes et al., 2018</a>). The reduction in stratospheric ozone also allows more UV radiation to reach the surface. The reduction in surface ozone, together with an increase in surface UV radiation, would have important implications for crop yields but there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>low confidence</span> in our understanding of the net impact.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Few studies have assessed potential SRM impacts on human health and well-being. SAI using sulphate aerosols is projected to deplete the ozone layer, increasing mortality from skin cancer, and SAI could increase particulate matter due to offsetting warming, reduced precipitation and deposition of SAI aerosols, which would increase mortality, but SAI also reduces surface-level ozone exposure, which would reduce mortality from air pollution, with net changes in mortality uncertain and depending on aerosol type and deployment scenario (<a class="reference-link" href="#Effiong--2016">Effiong and Neitzel, 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Eastham--2018">Eastham et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dai--2020">Dai et al., 2020</a>). However, these effects may be small compared with changes in risk from infectious disease (e.g., mosquito-borne illnesses) or food security due to SRM influences on climate (<a class="reference-link" href="#Carlson--2020">Carlson et al., 2020</a>). Using volcanic eruptions as a natural analogue, a sudden implementation of SAI that forced the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system may increase risk of severe cholera outbreaks in Bengal (<a class="reference-link" href="#Trisos--2018">Trisos et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pinke--2019">Pinke et al., 2019</a>).

From Figure 16.12, aside from SDG13 (climate action), the strongest connections and risk challenges are with zero hunger (SDG2), sustainable cities and communities (SDG11), life below water (SDG14), decent work and economic growth (SDG8), no poverty (SDG1), clean water and sanitation (SDG6) and good health and well-being (SDG3) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Other SDGs have strong linkages with specific RKRs, for example, terrestrial and marine ecosystems with life on land (SDG15); infrastructure (RKR-C) with industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG9) and affordable and clean energy (SDG7); living standards (RKR-D) with gender equality (SDG5); and peace and human mobility (RKR-H) with peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">On a global scale, priority areas for regions can be evaluated from the intersection of climate hazards, risks and the level of challenges in SDG attainment (<a class="reference-link" href="#Moyer--2020">Moyer and Hedden, 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sachs--2021">Sachs et al., 2021</a>).

Almost all the RKRs are strongly linked to SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>), where regions such as Africa, Asia, and Central and South America face significant to major challenges in attaining targets.

This aspect is discussed further in Chapter 18. Gaps may arise as SDG targets and indicators are not specifically focused on systems affected by climate change risks or impacts. For example, in the SRCCL <a class="section-link" data-title="Major Statements About Migration and Conflict in AR5" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-7#7.1.2">Section 7.1.2</a>, <a class="reference-link" href="#Hurlbert--2019">Hurlbert et al.

Such gaps (<a class="reference-link" href="#Tasaki--2015">Tasaki and Kameyama, 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Guppy--2019">Guppy et al., 2019</a>) are inevitable as the current SDG targets and indicators focus on overall sustainable development. As another example, projected increases in frequency and intensity of hot temperature extremes are likely to result in increased heat-related illness and mortality, yet heat extremes are not called out as an SDG indicator under SDGs 3 (good health and well-being) or 13 (climate action). The gaps on climate-related metrics for impacts on health are just beginning to be evaluated (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lloyd--2019">Lloyd and Hales, 2019</a>, see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Developments Relevant to Tracking and Assessing Climate Change Impacts on Health" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-7#7.1.6">Section 7.1.6</a>). The current SDG 13 (climate action) targets also do not specifically track the possibility of differential impacts on society from disasters and extreme weather events (RFC2). For example, the first indicator (<a class="section-link" data-title="Introduction and Geographical Scope" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-13#13.1.1">Section 13.1.1.1</a>), ‘Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population’, does not include any requirement for disaggregated data, unlike several other socioeconomic and population SDG indicators, making it difficult to track the different effects that climate-related disasters are expected to have on men, women and children across different segments of society, relevant for distributional impacts (RFC3) (see also <a class="section-link" data-title="Human Vulnerability, Spatial Hotspots, Observed Loss and Damage, and Livelihood Challenges" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-8#8.3">Section 8.3</a>, Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18). The risk consequences identified and discussed in each RKR (<a class="section-link" data-title="Identification and Assessment of Key Risks and Representative Key Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.2">Section 16.5.2</a>) provide useful entry points for identifying indicators and metrics for monitoring and evaluating specific impacts of key climate change risks. In addition, the sector and region chapters have considered various adaptation responses relevant to the SDGs (see, for example, Sections 3.6, 4.7.5, 5.13.3, 8.2.1.6, 10.6.1, 13.11.4, 14.6.3) with relevant metrics for evaluation.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In summary, key risks, and the consequences arising from them, are directly linked to and will affect specific indicators of the SDGs (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span>They also will be indirectly linked to, and thus affect, the SDGs overall, due to the interactions between the key risks (<a class="section-link" data-title="Key Risks across Sectors and Regions" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5">Section 16.5</a>) and between the SDGs themselves (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>very high confidence</span>).

First, RFCs assess risks that might be of global concern, while RKRs also include risks that may be of concern only locally or for specific population groups (Figure 16.13). RFCs focus on the full range of increasing risk, and locate transitions between four categories of risk: undetectable, moderate, high, and very high. RKRs focus on severe risks, and attempt to elaborate when/where severe impacts may occur. RKR assessments focus on the conditions under which some risks would become severe over the course of this century, while RFCs evaluate changes in risk levels against gradual increase in temperature levels. The RKR analysis used specific definitions of severity including quantified thresholds where possible, and this is distinct from the approach based on the combined elements of risk used in the RFC expert elicitation process. Severity as defined in the RKRs is associated with high or very high risk levels but does not align precisely with either of those categories, and a further difference arises from a more explicit emphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits in the very high risk category in the RFCs. Thus, RKR and RFC neither map directly to one another in terms of content, nor in terms of the response metric.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The treatment of vulnerability and adaptation is different in the RKR and RFC assessments. The RKR assessment considered specifically three alternative levels of vulnerability, whereas the RFC process did not explicitly differentiate risk by level of vulnerability. Therefore, the global warming levels at which the various RKR assessments identify risk of severe impacts are not directly comparable to risk transitions identified in the RFC assessments. In addition, RKRs consider implications of low versus high adaptation in order to illustrate the potential role of ambitious adaptation efforts to limit risk severity; RFCs consider risks in a no/low adaptation scenario only, although there is some discussion of the potential role of adaptation in assessing the transition to very high risk. Last, both RKRs and RFCs focus on the 21st century scale, though recognising risk will continue to increase after 2100, but treat this timing issue differently: RKRs assess severe risks over the course of this century and distinguish risks that are already severe, that will become severe by the mid-century, or that will become severe by the end of the century; while RFCs assess risk level irrespective of their timing, but according to different temperature levels.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Many of the elements of risk which contribute to RKRs also contribute to risk within one or more RFCs. In turn, elements of risk within some RFCs, such as extreme weather and changes in the Earth system contribute to risk within one or more RKR. Hence, RFCs may incorporate elements of many different RKRs, and vice versa. There are therefore common elements between some particular RKRs and RFCs: for example, risks to terrestrial and ocean ecosystems (RKR-B) contribute strongly to RFC1 (Unique and Threatened Systems) and RFC4 (Global Aggregate Impacts), while RFC2 (extreme weather events) has implications for all RKRs, including direct linkages with critical physical infrastructure, networks and services (RKR-C). Furthermore, risks emerging from the interaction of RKRs also contribute to the RFCs, but are only qualitatively described in <a class="section-link" data-title="RKR Interactions" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.4">Section 16.5.4</a>. For example, the effects of risks to terrestrial and ocean ecosystems (RKR-A) affect living standards and equity (RKR-C), as does the associated decline in ecosystem services which then impacts livelihoods (RKR-D).</p></div></div><div class="h4-container" id="Elicitation"><h4 class="Headings_H4-unnumbered" lang="de-DE">Elicitation Methodology <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h4><div class="h4-siblings" id="h4-18-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The method used to develop judgements on levels of risk builds on the approach described in WGII AR5 Chapter 19 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2014">Oppenheimer et al., 2014</a>) and outlined in more detail in the work of <a class="reference-link" href="#O%E2%80%99Neill--2017">O’Neill et al.

Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–1900, with stronger warming over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C) (WGI AR6 Cross Chapter Box 2.3 Table 1, Eyring et al. in <a class="reference-link" href="#Gulev--2021">Gulev et al., 2021</a>). Warming levels are commonly reported and studied in the impacts literature using two scales of spatially averaged temperature rise, global surface air temperature (GSAT), commonly produced by General Circulation Models (GCMs) when projecting climate changes, and global mean surface temperature (GMST), commonly used in empirical studies. Both have the same reference point of pre-industrial of 1850–1900. The ember diagrams presented here use GSAT, which is consistent with most literature of projected risk (largely based on the output of climate models). To the extent that the embers also draw on the observed impacts literature using GMST, this potential variation is minimal as the average levels of GSAT and GMST have been shown to match closely (for further discussion on this, see Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE in Chapter 1). Hence, the diagrams are presented with a single <span class="condensed_italic" lang>y</span>-axis representing global temperature change, generally referring to global temperature rise irrespective of when it occurs; however, the majority of the literature assessed considers alternative levels of warming during the 21st century.

The issues associated with assessing transient risks are discussed in Chapter 3, SR15 (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2018a">IPCC, 2018a</a>). Some of the literature, however, does explore the dynamics within human and natural systems (i.e., the way in which systems respond when a transient level of warming is first reached, and then further, how they continue to develop if that transient level of warming is then maintained indefinitely). We note that this important factor is captured in the RFC assessment (and ember diagrams), since the timing of risk accrual is one of the criteria for the assessment of the level of risk (<a class="section-link" data-title="Defining Key Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.1">Section 16.5.1</a>). Risks that are known to evolve only over very long-time scales contribute less to the level of risk than those which are known to occur rapidly. This is because SLR also depends on the dynamics of global warming, including the rate of change of radiative forcing, and time lags of several decades, including between atmospheric and ocean warming, and in reaching equilibrium sea level state (<a class="reference-link" href="#Oppenheimer--2019">Oppenheimer et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fox-Kemper--2021">Fox-Kemper et al., 2021</a>). However, longer-term risks that would arise if those transient temperatures were maintained are also included, and this is particularly important in RFC5 (large-scale singular events). Note that risks that take place over a very long time scale are considered to be of lower concern than more imminent risks. However, changes of very large magnitude can still be very important even if far away in time, especially if these changes are irreversible (or reversible only on extremely long time scales) (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Defining Key Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.1">Section 16.5.1</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Although the embers do not indicate the decade in which certain risks are projected to occur, clearly this depends strongly on the level of mitigation action as well as the degree of adaptation.

For example, in a scenario with a high level of mitigation effort (SSP1–1.9) reaching net zero emissions in the 2050s, it is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>extremely likely </span> that global warming remains below 2°C and more than 50%<span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> that it will remain below 1.6°C (AR6 WGI 4.3.1.1, <a class="reference-link" href="#Meinshausen--2020">Meinshausen et al., 2020</a>). On the other hand, a level of 2°C warming is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>extremely likely </span> to be exceeded during the 21st century under the three scenarios assessed by WGI AR6 in which GHG emissions do not fall below current levels before mid-century (i.e., SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0, SSP-8.5) (WGI AR6 4.3.1.1, <a class="reference-link" href="#Lee--2021">Lee et al., 2021</a>). WGI AR6 has assessed that ‘global surface temperature averaged over 2081–2100 is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>very likely </span> to be higher by 1.0°C–1.8°C under the lowest CO<span class="subscript CharOverride-1" lang>2</span> emission scenario considered in this report (SSP1–1.9) and by 3.3°C–5.7°C under the highest CO<span class="subscript CharOverride-1" lang>2</span> emission scenario (SSP5–8.5)’. However, almost all scenarios assessed by IPCC AR6 WGI reach 1.5°C global warming level in the early 2030s (WGI AR6 SPM, <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2021">IPCC, 2021</a>).</p></div></div><div class="h4-container" id="Temperature"><h4 class="Headings_H4-unnumbered" lang="de-DE">Temperature overshoot <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h4><div class="h4-siblings" id="h4-21-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The concept of temperature overshoot, defined as ‘exceedance of a specified global warming level followed by a decline to or below that level during a specified period of time’ is a relevant consideration for this RFC risk assessment; however, the effect of overshoot has not explicitly been considered in the burning ember assessment because of the limited literature basis. However, despite the lack of directly assessed overshoot scenarios, the current literature provides several salient examples of irreversible changes that are projected to occur once global temperatures reach a particular level. For example, coral reefs are unable to survive repeated bleaching events that are too close together, leading to irreversible loss of the reefs even if bleaching were to cease (see <a class="section-link" data-title="Reasons for Concern Across Scales" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.6">Section 16.6.3.1</a> RFC1). Species extinction is irreversible, and <a class="section-link" data-title="Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems and their Services" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2">Chapter 2</a> assesses that, at ~1.6°C, &gt;10% of species are projected to become endangered as compared with &gt;20% at ~2.1°C (median), representing high and very high biodiversity risk, respectively (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>) (<a class="section-link" data-title=" Key Risks to Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems from Climate Change" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2#2.5.4">Section 2.5.4</a>). Similarly, WGI AR6 finds that ‘Over the 21st century and beyond, abrupt and irreversible regional changes in the water cycle, including changes in seasonal precipitation, streamflow and aridity, cannot be excluded’. Thus, information about irreversibility provides information about the potential outcome of temperature overshoot scenarios. Other types of losses, such as loss of human or species life, are irreversible even if the loss process ceases in the future. The less resilient a system is, the more likely it is to suffer irreversible damage during a temperature overshoot; the more resilient it is, the more likely it is to be able to withstand the overshoot or recover afterwards. Very high levels of risk, as assessed here in the RFC, are associated with a wide range of criteria for risk assessment including irreversibility. While not all very high risks are irreversible, in general, risks reaching a very high level include a component of irreversible risks that would persist during and after an overshooting of a given temperature level.</p></div></div><div class="h4-container" id="Risks"><h4 class="Headings_H4-unnumbered" lang="de-DE">Risks associated with socioeconomic development, mitigation and maladaptation <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h4><div class="h4-siblings" id="h4-22-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The ember diagrams in Figure 16. 15 capture only the risks arising from exposure of vulnerable socio-ecological systems to climatic hazards across a range of socioeconomic futures. They do not capture any risk component arising solely from changes in population or level of development. Importantly, they also do not capture additional risks that may arise from the human response to climate change, including climate change mitigation or unintended negative consequences of adaptation-related responses (i.e., maladaptation) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Success and Maladaptation" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-17#17.5.1">Section 17.5.1</a>).

Unlike known or identified risks, emergent risks are characterised by the uncertainty of consequences and/or probabilities of occurrence. The International Risk Governance Council (IRGC) suggests three categories of emergent risks: (1) high uncertainty and a lack of knowledge about potential impacts and interactions with risk-absorbing systems; (2) increasing complexity, emergent interactions and systemic dependencies that can lead to nonlinear impacts and surprises; and (3) changes in context (for example, social and behavioural trends, organisational settings, regulations, natural environments) that may alter the nature, probability and magnitude of expected impacts. Feedback processes between climatic change, human interventions involving mitigation and adaptation actions, and processes in natural systems can be classified as emergent risks if they pose a threat to human security.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="16.6.2"><h2 class="Headings_H2-numbered" lang="de-DE">16.6.2 Framework and Approach for Assessment of RFCs and Relation to RKRs <span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-19-siblings"><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The RFC framework communicates scientific understanding about accrual of risk in relation to varying levels of warming for five broad categories: risk associated with (1) unique and threatened systems, (2) extreme weather events, (3) distribution of impacts, (4) global aggregate impacts and (5) large-scale singular events (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smith--2001">Smith et al., 2001</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Mastrandrea--2004">Mastrandrea and Schneider, 2004</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Schneider--2005">Schneider and Mastrandrea, 2005</a>).

The specific examples of such systems given in previous IPCC assessment reports has remained broadly consistent, with AR4 including ‘coral reefs, tropical glaciers, endangered species, unique ecosystems, biodiversity hotspots, small island states, and indigenous communities’ (Smith 2009), AR5 including ‘a wide range of physical, biological, and human systems that are restricted to relatively narrow geographical ranges’ and ‘are threatened by future changes in climate’ (<a class="reference-link" href="#Smith--2001">Smith et al., 2001</a>), and SR15 <a class="section-link" data-title="Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and their Services" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-3">Chapter 3</a> including ‘ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties.

A substantial number of unique and threatened systems are assessed to be in a high risk state owing to the influence of anthropogenic climate change by the 2000–2010 period, when global warming had reached approximately 0.85°C (range 0.7–1°C) (see WGI AR6 Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, <a class="reference-link" href="#Gulev--2021">Gulev et al., 2021</a>) using the 1995–2014 figure as a proxy for 2000–2010).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The most prominent example of a system assessed to be already in a high risk state is that of coral reefs, which are already degrading rapidly. Observed impacts on coral reefs increased significantly during 2014–2017 (Table SM16.22 , corresponding to a global warming of about 0.9°C). This includes mass bleaching in the Indian Ocean in 1998, 2010, 2015 and 2016 when bleaching intensity exceeded 20% in surveyed locations in the western Indian Ocean, eastern Indian Ocean and western Indonesia. In the tropical Pacific Ocean, climate-driven mass bleaching was reported in all countries in the region, with most bleaching reports coinciding with 2014–2017 marine heatwaves. Fifty percent of coral within shallow-water reefs of the northern and central two-thirds of the Great Barrier Reef were killed in 2015/2016. Subsequent coral recruitment in 2018 was reduced to only 11% of the long-term average, representing an unprecedented shift in the ecology of the northern and middle sections of the reef system to a highly degraded state. A second key example are sea-ice-dependent systems in the Arctic. During August to October of 2010–2019, corresponding to a global warming of about 0.9°C, average Arctic sea ice area has declined in area by 25% relative to 1979–1988 (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>, AR6 WGI, Figure 9.13). September Arctic sea ice volume has declined by about 72% between 1979 and 2016, with the latter deemed a conservative estimate (AR6 WGI, <a class="reference-link" href="#Schweiger--2019">Schweiger et al., 2019</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Other important examples of observed impacts on unique ecosystems that indicate that risks are already at a high level (Table SM16.22) include mass tree mortalities, now well recorded in multiple unique forest and woodland ecosystems around the world. Sections 2.4.3.3 and 2.4.5 report that, between 1945 and 2007, drought-induced tree mortality (sometimes associated with insect damage and wildfire) has caused the mortality of up to 20% of trees in western North America, the African Sahel, and North Africa, linked to a warming of 0.3–0.9°C above pre-industrial levels, and is implicated in more than 100 other cases of drought-induced tree mortality in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Species in biodiversity hotspots already show changes in response to climate change (CCP1, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). <a class="reference-link" href="#Rom%C3%A1n-Palacios--2020">Román-Palacios and Wiens (2020)</a> attribute local extinctions of several taxonomic groups between the latter 20th century and 2003–2012, (corresponding to warming of less than 0.85°C) to climate-change-related temperature extremes for up to 44% (0–75%) of species. Widespread declines of up to 35% in the species richness of the unique pollinator group, bumble bees, between 1901–1974 and 2000–2014 are also attributed to climate change, via increasing exceedance of their thermal tolerance limits across Europe and North America (<a class="reference-link" href="#Soroye--2020">Soroye et al., 2020</a>). The first extinctions attributed to climate change have been now detected with the present 1.2°C warming, including that of the Bramble Cay melomys (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>Melomys rubicola</span>), a sub-species of the lemuroid ringtail possum (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>Hemibelideus lemuroides</span>), and golden toad (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>Incilius periglenes</span>) (Chapter 2). An increasing frequency or unprecedented occurrence of mass animal mortality due to climate-change-enhanced heatwaves has also been observed in recent years on more than one continent, including temperature-vulnerable terrestrial birds and mammals in South Africa and Australia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ratnayake--2019">Ratnayake et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#McKechnie--2021">McKechnie et al., 2021</a>). There have also been 90% declines in sea-ice-dependent species such as sea lions and penguins in the Antarctic (Table SM16.22 ). A strong effect of climate change on the observed contraction of ranges of polar fish species and strong expansion of ranges of arcto-boreal or boreal fish was observed between 2004 and 2012 (Frainer et al.., 2017). Even if current human-driven habitat loss is excluded, many hotspots are projected to cease to be refugia (i.e., to remain climatically suitable for &gt;75% of the species they contain which have been modelled), at 1.0–1.5°C (Cross-Chapter Paper 1).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Based on observed and modelled impacts to unique and threatened systems, including in particular coral reefs, sea-ice-dependent systems and biodiversity hotspots, AR6 assesses that the transition to high risks for RFC1 have already occurred at a median level of 0.9°C, with a lower bound at 0.7°C and an upper bound at the present-day level of global warming of 1.2°C (<a class="reference-link" href="#WMO--2020">WMO, 2020</a>) (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>very high confidence</span>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Identification of the transition to very high risk is associated by definition with the reaching of limits to natural and/or societal adaptation.

However, this action is not effective if the unique and threatened systems in question reach a hard limit to adaptation (as in the case of the loss of Arctic summer sea ice, the submergence of a small island, the contraction and elimination of a species’ climatic niche from a mountaintop, or the degradation of a coral reef) (<a class="section-link" data-title="Synthesis of Limits to Adaptation across Natural and Human Systems" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.4">Section 16.4</a>). Furthermore, adaptation benefits deriving from restoration rapidly diminish with increasing temperature (Cross-Chapter Paper 1). One study quantifies how land management (in terms of protecting existing ecosystems or restoring lost ones) might reduce extinctions in biodiversity hotspots or globally significant terrestrial biodiversity areas more generally (<a class="reference-link" href="#Warren--2018b">Warren et al., 2018b</a>). While the latter suggests that substantial benefits can result globally in terrestrial systems, allowing less unique systems to persist at higher levels of warming but only under a high adaptation scenario in which globally applied terrestrial ecosystem restoration and protected area expansion takes place, this is less likely for many of the unique and threatened terrestrial systems which are more vulnerable than the globally significant biodiversity areas treated in that study (which excludes coral reefs and Arctic sea-ice-dependent systems). Such high levels of adaptation globally are likely infeasible owing to competition for land use with food production (<a class="reference-link" href="#P%C3%B6rtner--2021">Pörtner et al., 2021</a>). Novel targeted adaptation interventions for coral reefs such as artificial upwelling and local radiation management show some promise for reducing the adverse effects of thermal stress and resulting coral bleaching (<a class="reference-link" href="#Condie--2021">Condie et al., 2021</a>), but are far from implementation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sawall--2020">Sawall et al., 2020</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kleypas--2021">Kleypas et al., 2021</a>). Larger benefits in this RFC could theoretically accrue only if adaptation action became ubiquitous and extensive, which experts considered infeasible at the scales required.

Using the additional literature which became available on projected risks to Arctic sea ice, biodiversity and ecosystems at 1.5°C versus 2°C warming above pre-industrial levels, SR15 assessed that the transition from high to very high risks in RFC1 lay between 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In AR6, risks are considered to start to transition from high to very high risks above 1.2°C warming (present day, <a class="reference-link" href="#WMO--2020">WMO, 2020</a>), with a median value of 1.5°C, owing in particular to the observation of a present-day onset of ecosystem degradation in coral reefs, which are projected in the SR15 report ‘to decline by a further 70–90% at 1.5°C (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>very high confidence</span>)’ .

Since a necessary condition for ‘moderate’ levels of risk is the detection and attribution of observed impacts, the following text provides an overview of some salient examples of this evidence. In particular, WGI AR6 <a class="section-link" data-title="Australasia" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-11">Chapter 11</a> (<a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2021">Seneviratne et al., 2021</a>) concludes that some recent hot extreme events that happened in the past decade (2010s) would have been <span class="condensed_italic" lang>extremely unlikely </span> to occur without human influence on the climate system. Global warming in that decade reached approximately 1.09°C on average (IPCC WGI AR6 Chapter 2).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Assessment of a high level of risk requires a higher level of magnitude, severity and spatial extent of the risks. Events prior to that already had substantial impacts, such as the 2003 European heatwave (IPCC SREX Chapter 9). Examples of impactful events in the early 2010s (at ca. 0.95°C of global warming; WGI AR6 Chapter 2, <a class="reference-link" href="#Gulev--2021">Gulev et al., 2021</a>) include the 2010 Russian heatwave (<a class="reference-link" href="#Barriopedro--2011">Barriopedro et al., 2011</a>) and the 2010 Amazon drought (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lewis--2011">Lewis et al., 2011</a>). Later impactful events include, among others, the 2013 heatwave in eastern China (<a class="reference-link" href="#Sun--2014">Sun et al., 2014</a>), the 2017 tropical cyclone Harvey (<a class="reference-link" href="#Risser--2017">Risser and Wehner, 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Van%20Oldenborgh--2017">Van Oldenborgh et al., 2017</a>) and the 2018 concurrent North Hemisphere heatwaves in Europe, North America and Asia (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vogel--2019">Vogel et al., 2019</a>). Very recent events with severe and unprecedented impacts attributed to anthropogenic climate change indicate that thresholds to high risks may already have been crossed at recent levels of global warming (ca. 1.1–1.2°C), including the Siberian fires and the 2019 Australian bushfires that were linked to extreme heat and drought conditions (<a class="reference-link" href="#Van%20Oldenborgh--2017">Van Oldenborgh et al., 2017</a>) and extreme precipitation linked to increased storm activity in the USA (<a class="reference-link" href="#Van%20Oldenborgh--2017">Van Oldenborgh et al., 2017</a>). Severe and unprecedented impacts occurred with current low levels of adaptation (<a class="section-link" data-title="Food system" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.2.3.4">Section 16.2.3.4</a>). The global-scale risk of wildfire considerably degrading ecosystems and increasing illnesses and death of people has been assessed to transition from undetectable to moderate over the range 0.6–0.9°C with <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> (Chapter 2, Table SM2.5, Figure 2.11).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In addition, long-term trends in various types of extremes are now detectable (WGI AR6 Chapter 11, <a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2021">Seneviratne et al., 2021</a>). This includes increases in hot extremes over most land regions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>virtually certain</span>), increases in heavy precipitation at the global scale and over most regions with sufficient observations (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>), and increases in agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>) (WGI AR6 Chapter 11). There has also been overall a <span class="condensed_italic" lang>likely </span> increase in the probability of compound events, such as an increase in concurrent heatwaves and droughts (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>) (WGI AR6 Chapter 11). There is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span> that weather conditions that promote wildfires (fire weather) have become more probable in southern Europe, northern Eurasia, the USA and Australia over the last century (WGI AR6 Chapter 11; SRCCL Chapter 2, <a class="reference-link" href="#Jolly--2015">Jolly et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Abatzoglou--2016">Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016</a>). Furthermore, food security and livelihoods are being affected by short-term food shortages caused by climate extremes (<a class="section-link" data-title="Introduction" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-5#5.12.1">Section 5.12.1</a>; Chapter 16, Food Security RKR) which have affected the productivity of all agricultural and fishery sectors (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). The frequency of sudden food production losses has increased since at least mid-20th century on land and sea (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium evidence</span>, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high agreement </span>). Droughts, floods and marine heatwaves contribute to reduced food availability and increased food prices, threatening food security, nutrition and livelihoods of millions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Changes in sea surface temperatures drive simultaneous variation in climate extremes, increasing the risk of multi-breadbasket failures (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cai--2014">Cai et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Perry--2017">Perry et al., 2017</a>). Droughts induced by the 2015–2016 El Niño, partially attributable to human influences (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>), caused acute food insecurity in various regions, including eastern and southern Africa and the dry corridor of Central America (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). Human-induced climate change warming also worsened the 2007 drought in southern Africa, causing food shortages, price spikes and acute food insecurity in Lesotho (<a class="reference-link" href="#Verschuur--2021">Verschuur et al., 2021</a>). In the fisheries and aquaculture sector, marine heatwaves are estimated to have doubled in frequency between 1982 and 2016, as well as increasing in intensity and length, with consequences for fish mortality (Chapter 5; <a class="reference-link" href="#Smale--2019">Smale et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Laufk%C3%B6tter--2020">Laufkötter et al., 2020</a>). In the northeast Pacific, a recent 5-year warm period impacted the migration, distribution and abundance of key fish resources (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>). At 1°C warming, the number of people affected by six categories of extreme events was found to have already increased by a factor of 2.3 relative to pre-industrial (<a class="reference-link" href="#Lange--2020">Lange et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The general picture is one of annual or more frequent occurrences of severe extremes with widespread impacts (as also reflected in <a class="section-link" data-title="Synthesis of observed impacts of changes in climate related systems" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.2">Section 16.2</a>), and of multiple extremes, meeting the criteria for the ‘severe and widespread’ nature of risks that is required for classification at a ‘high’ level of risk.

In particular, heavy precipitation and associated flooding are projected to intensify and be more frequent in most regions in Africa and Asia (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>), North America (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium</span> to <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> depending on the region) and Europe (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>). Also, more frequent and/or severe agricultural and ecological droughts are projected in a few regions in all continents except Asia, compared with 1850–1900 (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>); increases in meteorological droughts are also projected in a few regions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>). Increases at 1.5°C of global warming are projected in marine heatwaves (<a class="reference-link" href="#Laufk%C3%B6tter--2020">Laufkötter et al., 2020</a>) and the occurrence of fire weather (<a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2019a">IPCC, 2019a</a>). Heat-related mortality is assessed to increase from moderate to high levels of risk under about 1.5°C warming under SSP3, a socioeconomic scenario with large challenges to adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ebi--2021">Ebi et al., 2021</a>) especially in urban centres (Chapter 6). An additional 350 million people living in urban areas are estimated to be exposed to water scarcity from severe droughts at 1.5°C warming (Sections 6.1, 6.2.2; CCP2 Coastal Cities). In summary, there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span> that the best estimate for the transition from moderate to high risk is 1.2°C of global warming, with 1°C as lower estimate and 1.5°C as upper estimate. The latter would be set to 1.3°C for an assessment at <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">As in RFC1, one of the criteria for identification of very high risks is limits to adaptation. Though the literature explicitly considering societal adaptation to extreme weather events is limited, there is evidence that investments in hydro-meteorological information, early-warning systems and anticipatory forecast-based finance are a cost-effective way to prevent some of the most adverse effects of extreme events (<a class="reference-link" href="#Coughlan%20de%20Perez--2016">Coughlan de Perez et al., 2016</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Fakhruddin--2019">Fakhruddin and Schick, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Merz--2020">Merz et al., 2020</a>). Despite a lack of systematic methods for assessing general adaptation effectiveness, there is some evidence of risk reduction for particular places and hazards, especially flood and heat vulnerability (<a class="section-link" data-title="Adaptation Effectiveness, Adequacy and Risk Reduction" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.3.2.4">Section 16.3.2.4</a>), including investment in flood protection, building design and monitoring and forecasting, air conditioning, reduced social vulnerability, and improved population health. One study finds declining global mortality and economic loss due to extreme weather events over the past four decades (<a class="reference-link" href="#Formetta--2019">Formetta and Feyen, 2019</a>) especially in low-income countries. Using SSP2 as a proxy for expanded adaptation, <a class="reference-link" href="#Ebi--2021">Ebi et al. (2021)</a> assess that the transition to high risk for heat-related mortality increases to 1.8°C (compared with 1.5°C with less adaptation under SSP3). There is evidence of adaptation avoiding heat-related mortality at low levels of global warming, using early-warning and response systems and sustainable alterations of the thermal environment at the individual, building, urban and landscape levels (<a class="reference-link" href="#Jay--2021">Jay et al., 2021</a>). Despite the evidence that adaptation can reduce risks of heat stress, the impact of projected climate change on temperature-related mortality is expected to be a net increase under a wide range of climate change scenarios, even with adaptation (Chapter 7, <span class="condensed_italic" lang>high confidence</span>)<span class="condensed_italic" lang>. </span>Much of the adaptation literature focuses on coping with long-term gradual climate change and largely does not take into account the increased difficulty of adapting to climate extremes and general higher variability in climate that is projected to occur in the future. However, expanding and more coordinated adaptation, including wider implementation and multi-level coordination, has the potential to reduce the risks to crops from heatwaves at intermediate (but not high) levels of warming.(IPCC AR5 Ch7, <a class="reference-link" href="#Ahmed--2018">Ahmed et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ahmed--2019">Ahmed et al., 2019</a>, <a class="section-link" data-title="Who Is Responding?" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.3.2.2">Section 16.3.2.2</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#EEA--2019">EEA, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Raza--2019">Raza et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tripathi--2020">Tripathi and Sindhi, 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">The transition from high to very high risk for the RFC2 was not assessed in the AR5 or in SR15. Some new evidence suggests, however, that very high risks associated with weather and climate extremes would <span class="condensed_italic" lang></span> be reached at higher levels of global warming. In particular, changes in several hazards would be more widespread and pronounced at 2°C compared with 1.5°C global warming, including increases in multiple and concurrent extremes (IPCC WGI AR6 SPM; IPCC WGI AR6 Chapter 11, IPCC WGI AR6 Chapter 12). On average over land, high temperature events that would have occurred once in 50 years in the absence of anthropogenic climate change are projected to become 13.9 times more likely with 2°C warming, and 39.2 times more likely with 4°C warming (IPCC AR6 WGI SPM Figure SPM.6, <a class="reference-link" href="#IPCC--2021">IPCC, 2021</a>), indicating a nonlinear increase with warming. <a class="section-link" data-title="Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems and their Services" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-2">Chapter 2</a> assessed that risk of wildfire transitions from moderate to high over the range 1.5°C to 2.5°C warming (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span>, Table SM2.5 , Figure 2.11). The intensity of heavy precipitation events increases overall by about 7% for each additional degree of global warming (IPCC AR6 WGI SPM), while their frequency increases nonlinearly. Events that would have occurred once every 10 years in a climate without human influence are projected to become 1.7 times more likely with 2°C warming, and 2.7 times more likely with 4°C warming (IPCC AR6 WGI SPM Figure SPM.6). Several AR6 regions are projected to be affected by increases in agricultural and ecological droughts at 2°C of global warming, including western North America, central North America, northern Central America, southern Central America, the Caribbean, northern South America, northeastern South America, South American Monsoon, southwestern South America, southern South America, West and Central Europe, the Mediterranean, western Southern Africa, eastern Southern Africa, Madagascar, eastern Australia and southern Australia (IPCC WGI AR6, Chapter 11, <a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2021">Seneviratne et al., 2021</a>). This is a substantially larger number compared with projections at 1.5°C (IPCC WGI AR6, Chapter 11, <a class="reference-link" href="#Seneviratne--2021">Seneviratne et al., 2021</a>). In these drying regions, events that would have occurred once every 10 years in a climate without human influence are projected to happen 2.4 times more frequently at 2°C of global warming (IPCC WGI AR6 SPM Figure SPM.6). Urban land exposed to floods and droughts is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>very likely </span> to have more than doubled between 2000 and 2030, and the risk of flooding accelerates after 2050 (Chapter 4). At 2°C of global warming, there are also significant projected increases in fluvial flood frequency and resultant risks associated with higher populations exposed to these flood risks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Alfieri--2017">Alfieri et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dottori--2018">Dottori et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Heat-related mortality is assessed to increase from high to very high by 3°C under SSP3, a socioeconomic scenario with large challenges to adaptation (<a class="reference-link" href="#Ebi--2021">Ebi et al., 2021</a>).

This number would reach about 65% of megacities at 2.7°C and close to 80% at 4°C. In addition, there is evidence for a higher risk of concurrent heat extremes at different locations with increasing global warming (<a class="reference-link" href="#Vogel--2019">Vogel et al., 2019</a>), meaning that several cities could be affected by deadly heatwaves simultaneously. Laufkötter et al.

While most of the literature assessed here focuses on the resultant changes to climate-related hazards such as sea level rise, in this assessment, evidence about the implications of accelerated sea level rise for human and natural systems is also considered. If sea level rise is accelerated by ice sheet melt, the associated impacts are projected to occur decades earlier than otherwise, directly affecting coastal systems including cities and settlements by the sea (CCP2) and wetlands (Chapter 2). The associated disruption to ports is projected to severely compromise global supply chains and maritime trade with local–global geo-political and economic consequences. To compensate for this acceleration, adaptation would need to occur much faster and at a much greater scale than otherwise, or indeed than has previously been observed (CCP2).

At the time of SR15, observations were suggesting that MISI might already be taking place in some parts of the WAIS, while AR5 supported assessment of an additional MISI contribution to SLR of several additional tenths of a metre over the next two centuries. Since SR15, new observations (WGI AR6 <a class="section-link" data-title="Governance Barriers" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-9#9.4.2.1">Section 9.4.2.1</a>, <a class="reference-link" href="#Fox-Kemper--2021">Fox-Kemper et al., 2021</a>) support the assessment of enhanced grounding line retreat and subsequent mass loss through basal melt in various parts of Antarctica, and year 2100 sea level projections for the RCP8.5 scenario have increased by 10–12 cm owing to ice dynamics. However, the onset of MISI is driven by ocean warming in specific locations (ice cavities beneath floating ice shelves), and the relation between these ocean temperatures and global mean temperature is indirect and ambiguous. In addition, MISI implies a self-sustaining instability in the absence of further forcing. Because forcing is still increasing, it cannot be unambiguously assessed whether MISI is driving the observed retreat of grounding lines in the WAIS, or whether this retreat is a purely forced response (and would stop if the warming stops) or is just a manifestation of natural variability in upwelling of warmer waters on the Antarctic continental shelves and, as a result, is just a temporary effect. Consistent with SROCC, AR6 states with <span class="condensed_italic" lang>medium confidence</span> that sustained mass losses of several major glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) are compatible with the onset of MISI, but that whether unstable WAIS retreat has already begun or is imminent remains a critical uncertainty.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Whether associated with MISI or not, WGI AR6 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Fox-Kemper--2021">Fox-Kemper et al., 2021</a>) now assesses with <span class="condensed_italic" lang>very high confidence</span> that mass loss from both the Antarctic (whether associated with MISI or not) and Greenland Ice Sheets, is more than seven times higher over the period 2010–2016 than over the period 1992–1999 for Greenland and four times higher for the same time intervals for Antarctica. Given their multi-century commitments to global SLR, this reinforces the assessment of estimating the boundary between undetectable and moderate risks for ice sheets to lie between 0.7°C (the level of global warming in the 1990s when melting began to accelerate) and 1°C (as in SR15), with a median of 0.9°C.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">In the Amazon Forest, increases in tree mortality and a decline in the carbon sink are already reported (<a class="reference-link" href="#Brienen--2015">Brienen et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hubau--2020">Hubau et al., 2020</a>), and old-growth Amazon Rainforest may have become a net carbon source for the period 2010–2019 (<a class="reference-link" href="#Qin--2021">Qin et al., 2021</a>).

An increasing fraction of ice sheet models shows additional sustained mass loss from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) for peak warming between 2°C and 4°C, and all ice sheet models show mass loss for peak warming higher than 4°C.

Similarly, the likelihood for accelerated and irreversible mass loss from Antarctica increases with increasing temperatures, but thresholds cannot yet be unambiguously identified.

It should be noted that inclusion of such low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes dominated by not-well-understood processes affecting ice dynamics on the large ice caps of Greenland, and in particular Antarctica, would also enhance the sea level projections for other scenarios, but to a lesser extent for increasingly weaker forcing.

Therefore, we base judgements about risk transitions related to ice sheets primarily on their implications for 2000-year commitments to SLR from sustained mass loss from both ice sheets as projected by various ice sheet models, reaching 2.3–3.1 m at 1.5°C peak warming and 2–6 m at 2.0°C peak warming (WGI AR6 TS, Box TS.4 Figure 1; <a class="reference-link" href="#Arias--2021">Arias et al., 2021</a>).

These measures include the economic costs of climate change that could be felt in market sectors such as agriculture, energy services, labour productivity and coastal resources, as well as non-market impacts such as other types of human health risks (including mortality effects) and ecosystems. Global economic impacts estimates can inform decisions about global climate management strategy, while SCC estimates can inform globally incremental emissions decisions. In practice, economic damage estimates have been used to explore economically efficient (‘economically optimal’) global emissions pathways (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Nordhaus--2017">Nordhaus and Moffat, 2017</a>), while SCCs have been used to inform federal and state-level policy assessment in some countries (<a class="reference-link" href="#Greenstone--2013">Greenstone et al., 2013</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rose--2016">Rose and Bistline, 2016</a>), but the type of SCC and application matters (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rose--2017">Rose, 2017</a>). This literature has been assessed in previous WGII reports (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Arent--2014">Arent et al., 2014</a>), and this box serves this need for this report. The assessment in this box was performed jointly across WGII and WGIII, building on the foundation of WGII AR6 Chapter 16’s ‘Risk to living standards’ assessment (<a class="section-link" data-title="Assessment of Representative Key Risks" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.5.2.3">Section 16.5.2.3.4</a>), which includes consideration of severe risks to global aggregate economic output, and WGIII AR6 Chapter 3’s assessment of the benefits of mitigation. It also informs Chapter 16’s global aggregate impacts Reasons for Concern and supports Chapter 18’s assessment of global emissions transitions, risk management and climate resilient development. In keeping with the broad risk framing presented in <a class="section-link" data-title="Point of Departure and Key Concepts" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-1">Chapter 1</a> of this report, other lines of evidence regarding climate risks, beyond monetary estimates, should be considered in decision making, including key risks and Reasons for Concern.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H2" lang="en-GB">Methods for estimating global economic costs of climate impacts</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">There are several broad approaches to estimating climate damages, including biophysical process models, structural economic models, statistical methods (also called empirical or econometric) and hybrid approaches, with each methodology having strengths and weaknesses. Process models simulate physical, natural science and/or engineering processes and their response to climate variables, which are then monetised (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Anthoff--2014">Anthoff and Tol, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Sieg--2019">Sieg et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Narita--2020">Narita et al., 2020</a>). Process approaches have the advantage of being explicit and interpretable, though they can be computationally intensive; may omit relevant impact channels, interactions and market dynamics affecting valuation; and often lack a rigorous empirical basis for calibration (Fisher-Vanden et al.). Structural economic modelling represents climate impacts on inputs, production, household consumption, aggregate investment, and markets for economic sectors and regional economies (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Reilly--2007">Reilly et al., 2007</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Roson--2012">Roson and Van der Mensbrugghe, 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Anthoff--2014">Anthoff and Tol, 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dellink--2019">Dellink et al., 2019</a>; Takakura et al., 2019), often using computable general equilibrium (CGE) frameworks. Structural models can evaluate how market and non-market impacts might enter and transmit through economies, and adaptation responses within input and output markets, consumer and investment choices, and inter-regional trade (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Darwin--2001">Darwin and Tol, 2001</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dellink--2019">Dellink et al., 2019</a>; Takakura et al., 2019). Statistical methods estimate economic impacts in a given sector (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Auffhammer--2018">Auffhammer, 2018</a>) or in aggregate (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Dell--2014">Dell et al., 2014</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Burke--2015">Burke et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hsiang--2017">Hsiang et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pretis--2018">Pretis et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Kahn--2019">Kahn et al., 2019</a>), inferred from observed changes in economic factors, weather and climate, with responses and net results constrained by available data. Since AR5, hybrid approaches have taken different forms to integrate process, statistical and/or structural methods, and represent a potentially promising means of leveraging the strengths of different approaches (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Moore--2015">Moore and Diaz, 2015</a>; and <a class="reference-link" href="#Hsiang--2017">Hsiang et al., 2017</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Moore--2017a">Moore et al., 2017a</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Ricke--2018">Ricke et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Yumashev--2019">Yumashev et al., 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Chen--2020b">Chen et al., 2020b</a>).

Global estimates are frequently based on an aggregation of independent sector and/or regional modelling and estimates; however, there are examples of estimates from global modelling that simulate multiple types of climate impacts and their potential interactions within a single, coherent framework (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Roson--2012">Roson and Van der Mensbrugghe, 2012</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Dellink--2019">Dellink et al., 2019</a>; Takakura et al., 2019).

Going forward, to help advance science and decisions, a key research priority is to understand and evaluate methodological strengths and weaknesses in damage estimation, and reconcile the differences affecting comparability in such a way that it informs use of the different lines of evidence. This will require greater transparency and assessment of details and assumptions in individual methods, communication and evaluation of alternatives for specifying or calibrating climate damage functional representations with respect to climate and non-climate drivers and potential nonlinearities, including evaluating data sufficiency for levels within and beyond observations and for characterising physical system dynamics, and evaluating the sensitivity of results to model specification and input parameter choices (<a class="reference-link" href="#Cropper--2017">Cropper et al., 2017</a>). Improving the robustness of economic impact estimates is an active area of research. Below we describe the latest estimates.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H2" lang="en-GB">Global estimates of the economic costs of climate impacts</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Since AR5, many new estimates of the global economic costs of climate change have been produced. Figure Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC.1 shows a wide spread of estimates, with growing variance at higher levels of warming, both within and across methodology types (i.e., statistical, structural or meta-analysis). Meta-analysis is used here to refer to studies that treat other studies’ estimates as data points in an attempt to derive a synthesised functional form.</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">Global aggregate economic impact estimates (Figure Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC.1) are generally found to increase with global average temperature change, as well as vary by other drivers, such as income and population and the composition of the economy. Most estimates are nonlinear with higher marginal economic impacts at higher temperature, although some recover declining marginal economic impacts, and functional forms cannot be determined for all studies. The drivers of nonlinearity found in economic impact estimates, and the differences in nonlinearity across estimates (e.g., convex versus concave, degree of curvature), are not well understood, with methodology construction, assumptions and data all being potential factors. Relative to AR5, there have been more estimates and greater variation in estimates, including some recent estimates significantly higher than the range reported in AR5. For most of the studies shown in Figure Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC.1, the visible variation within a study represents alternative socioeconomic projections and climate modelling, not economic impacts response uncertainty for a given socioeconomic and climate condition. Response uncertainty could be significant, as indicated by some of the results shown in the figure (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Burke--2015">Burke et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Rose--2017">Rose et al., 2017</a>), but methodological differences in how uncertainty is characterised (model specification, errors and confidence intervals versus distributions of results) limit comparability and assessment. Note that modelling factors between global temperature change and the economic impact calculation, such as regional temperature pattern assumptions or assumed SLR dynamics, can also impact calculated estimates (e.g., Warren et al.., 2021 PAGE09 estimates versus those in Rose et al.., 2017, Chen et al.., 2020 PAGE-ICE estimates versus Burke et al.., 2015).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">From Figure Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC.1, we find a large span of damage estimates, even without considering uncertainty/confidence in damage responses, including for today’s level of warming (about 1°C). There is also evidence that some regions benefit from low levels of warming, leading to net benefits globally at these temperatures. The size of the span of estimates grows with global warming level, with variation across statistical estimates larger than variation in structural estimates. The structural and meta-analyses estimates appear to be in closer agreement, but that outcome is contingent on the meta-analyses’ data considerations and approach. Meta analyses to date have not assessed the alternative methods and dealt with the lack of comparability between methods.</p><div class="Figure"><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-17" id="figure-16-cross-working-group-box-economic-1" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_16_Cross-Working_Group_Box_ECONOMIC-1.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_Figure_title ParaOverride-8" lang="en-GB"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Global aggregate economic impact estimates by global warming level (annual % global GDP loss relative to GDP without additional climate change). </span>Top row panels present estimates by methodology type: (a) statistical modelling, (b) structural modelling and (c) meta-analyses, with all estimates from a paper in the same colour and estimates from methodologies other than that highlighted by the panel in grey for reference.

The different methodologies affect outcomes, with global aggregate estimates based on statistical methodologies typically higher than those from structural modelling (Figure Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC.1). This is, in part, due to the relationships in observational data captured by statistical modelling, assumed persistence of impacts in statistical modelling, broader adaptation responses in structural modelling, and differences in the representation of future societies and how they might evolve, respond and interact. Within statistical modelling, results are also found to be very sensitive to the statistical model specification (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Burke--2015">Burke et al., 2015</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Newell--2021">Newell et al., 2021</a>).

Regional results illustrate the potential for overall net benefits in more temperate regions at lower levels of warming with potential lower energy demand and comparative advantages in agricultural markets; however, at higher levels of warming, net losses are estimated. In addition, economic impacts for poorer households and poorer countries represent a smaller share in aggregate quantifications expressed in GDP terms than their influence on well-being or welfare (<a class="reference-link" href="#Byers--2018">Byers et al., 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Hallegatte--2020">Hallegatte et al., 2020</a>).</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_subhead_H2" lang="en-GB">Social cost of carbon methods and estimates</p><p class="Body_Box_blue_Box_body" lang="en-GB">The global economic impact estimates discussed in the previous section serve as a key input into the calculation of the value of potential net damages caused by a marginal ton of carbon dioxide emissions, or the SCC. To compute an SCC, damage estimates are commonly combined in a multi-century modelling framework with socioeconomic and emissions projections, a physical model of the climate, including a SLR component, and assumptions about the discount rate, with current frameworks having highly stylised representations of these components. Though we do not present quantitative estimates here, due to the challenge of comparability, for economic impacts methodologies (as discussed above) as well as other SCC estimation elements, large variations in SCC estimates are found in the literature assessed due to, among other things, differences in modelling component representations, input and parameter assumptions, considerations of uncertainty, and discounting, inflation, and emissions year (e.g., <a class="reference-link" href="#Tol--2009">Tol, 2009</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Tol--2018">Tol, 2018</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Pezzey--2019">Pezzey, 2019</a>; <a class="reference-link" href="#Iese--2021">Iese et al., 2021</a>). There are also different ‘variants’ of SCC estimates that differ conceptually, and in magnitude, depending on the reference condition for evaluating the impact of a marginal metric ton—is it being evaluated relative to a no-climate-policy baseline, an economically efficient pathway that weighs the benefits and costs of emissions mitigation, or a pathway based on a particular climate policy or goal such as 2°C or a concentration target (<a class="reference-link" href="#Rose--2017">Rose et al., 2017</a>)?

These highest levels of risk are associated with an irreversible component, such that some impacts would persist even were global temperatures to subsequently decline in an ‘overshooting’ scenario.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">Lack of evidence on the potential for adaptation to adequately reduce risk is a critical gap in our ability to assess global risk transitions at the RFC level, but not the only gap. In some cases, such as RFC1, the widespread nature and rapid speed of the escalating risks, in combination with limited ability to adapt, means that transitions to high risk may occur despite medium or even high levels of adaptation. Risks that are largely natural and not widely mediated by human vulnerability are thus less likely to have risk transitions that shift under higher societal adaptation. Risk transitions that are mediated through human systems, such as distribution impacts, for example, are more likely to shift in response to adaptation as impacts are strongly mediated through vulnerability within human systems, but such a shift is difficult to quantify given knowledge gaps in the literature (<a class="section-link" data-title="Synthesis of Observed Adaptation-Related Responses" href="/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-16#16.3">Section 16.3</a>). However, in some circumstances, expanded global adaptation could slow some of these transitions (<span class="condensed_italic" lang>low confidence</span>); in the case of RFC2, RFC3 and RFC4, the literature suggests that coordinated global adaptation could increase the global temperature at which risks transition from moderate to high, for example the prevention of mortality associated with heat stress within RFC2.</p><p class="Body_Body-justify" lang="en-GB">A higher level of adaptation, applied globally and effectively, could have larger benefits for several RFC, either postponing the onset of a high level of risk until a higher level of warming is reached (and allowing time for mitigation efforts) or allowing a system to survive a temporary overshoot of a lower temperature threshold. Adaptations are likely to have significant potential to reduce risks (<a class="reference-link" href="#Magnan--2021">Magnan et al., 2021</a>), in particular for risks mediated through human systems. However, there is <span class="condensed_italic" lang>limited evidence</span> available to assess the extent to which current or potential adaptations are or would be adequate in reducing climate risks at different levels of warming, and adaptation implications for risk transitions will be highly localised. Pathways and opportunities for risk management and adaptation actions with transformational potential are discussed in Chapter 17, together with enabling factors, governance frameworks, financing, success factors, and monitoring and evaluation discussed in Chapter 18, supporting sustainable system transitions and leading to options for climate resilient development pathways.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="frequently-asked-questions"><h1 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_head" lang="en-US">Frequently Asked Questions </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-9-siblings"></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 16.1"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 16.1 | What are key risks in relation to climate change?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-27-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>A few clusters of key risks can be identified which have the potential to become particularly severe and pose significant challenges for adaptation worldwide. These risks, therefore, deserve special attention. They include risks to important resources such as food and water, risks to critical infrastructures, economies, health and peace, as well as risks to threatened ecosystems and coastal areas. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The IPCC defines key risks related to climate change as potentially severe risks that are relevant to the primary goal of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty to avoid ‘dangerous human interference with the climate system’, and whatever the scale considered (global to local). What constitutes ‘dangerous’ or ‘severe’ risks is partly a value judgement and can therefore vary widely across people, communities or countries. However, the severity of risks also depends on criteria like the magnitude, irreversibility, timing, likelihood of the impacts they describe, and the adaptive capacity of the affected systems (species or societies). The Working Group II authors use these criteria in various ways to identify those risks that could become especially large in the future owing to the interaction of physical changes to the climate system with vulnerable populations and ecosystems exposed to them. For example, some natural systems may be at risk of collapsing, as is the case for warm-water coral reefs by mid-century, even if global warming is limited to +1.5°C. For human systems, severe risks can include increasing restriction of water resources that are already being observed; mortality or economic damages that are large compared with historical crises; or impacts on coastal systems from SLR and storms that could make some locations uninhabitable.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">More than 120 key risks across sectors and regions have been identified by the chapters of this report, which have then been clustered into a set of 8 overarching risks, called representative key risks, which can occur from global to local scales but are of potential significance for a wide diversity of regions and systems globally. As shown in Figure FAQ16.1.1, the representative key risks include risks to (a) low-lying coastal areas, (b) terrestrial and marine ecosystems, (c) critical infrastructures and networks, (d) living standards, (e) human health, (f) food security, (g) water security and (h) peace and human mobility.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">These representative key risks are expected to increase in the coming decades and will depend strongly not only on how much climate change occurs, but also on how the exposure and vulnerability of society changes, as well as on the extent to which adaptation efforts will be effective enough to substantially reduce the magnitude of severe risks. The report finds that risks are highest when high warming combines with development pathways with continued high levels of poverty and inequality, poor health systems, lack of capacity to invest in infrastructure, and other characteristics making societies highly vulnerable. Some regions already have high levels of exposure and vulnerability, such as in many developing countries as well as communities in small islands, Arctic areas and high mountains; in these regions, even low levels of warming will contribute to severe risks in the coming decades. Some risks in industrialised countries could also become severe over the course of this century, for example if climate change affects critical infrastructure such as transport hubs, power plants or financial centres. In some cases, such as coral reef environments and areas already severely affected by intense extreme events (e.g., recent typhoons or wildfires), climate risks are already considered severe.</p><div class="Figure"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-18" id="figure-16-faq-16-1-1" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_16_FAQ_16_1_1.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure FAQ16.1.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Presentation of the eight representative key risks assessed in this report (and their underlying main key risks). </span></p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_continued-prev-page" lang="en-US">Box FAQ 16.1</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 16.2"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 16.2 | How does adaptation help to manage key risks and what are its limits?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-28-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Adaptation helps to manage key risks by reducing vulnerability or exposure to climate hazards. However, constraining factors make it harder to plan or implement adaptation and result in adaptation limits beyond which risks cannot be prevented. Limits to adaptation are already being experienced, for instance by coastal communities, small-scale farmers and some natural systems. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Adaptation-related responses are actions that are taken with the intention of managing risks by reducing vulnerability or exposure to climate hazards. While mitigation responses aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow warming, adaptations respond to the impacts and risks that are unavoidable, either due to past emissions or failure to reduce emissions. However, while these responses intend to reduce risks, it is difficult to determine precise levels of risk reduction that can be attributed to adaptation. Changing levels of risk as well as other actions—such as economic development—make it challenging to definitively connect specific levels of risk reduction with adaptation. Although it is not feasible to assess the adequacy of adaptation for risk reduction at global or regional levels, evidence from specific localised adaptation projects do show that adaptation-related responses reduce risk. Moreover, many adaptation measures offer near-term co-benefits related to mitigation and to sustainable development, including enhancing food security and reducing poverty.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Adaptation responses can occur in natural systems without the intervention of humans, such as species shifting their range, time of breeding, or migration behaviour. Humans can also assist adaptation in natural systems through, for example, conservation activities such as species regeneration projects or protecting ecosystem services. Other adaptation-related responses by humans aim to reduce risk by decreasing vulnerability and/or exposure of people to climate hazards. This includes infrastructural projects (e.g., upgrading water systems to improve flood control), technological innovation (e.g., early-warning systems for extreme events), behavioural change (e.g., shift to new crop types or livelihood strategies), cultural shifts (e.g., changing perspectives on urban greenspace, or increased recognition of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge) and institutional governance (e.g., adaptation planning, funding and legislation).</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">While adaptation is important to reduce risk, adaptation cannot prevent all climate impacts from occurring. Adaptation has soft and hard limits, points at which adaptive actions are unable to prevent risks. Soft limits can change over time as additional adaptation options become available, while hard limits will not change as there are no additional adaptive actions that are possible. Soft limits occur largely due to constraints—factors that make it harder to plan and implement adaptation, such as lack of financial resources or insufficient human capacity. Across regions and sectors, the most challenging constraints to adaptation are financial and those related to governance, institutions and policy measures. Limited funding and ineffective governance structures make it difficult to plan and implement adaptation-related responses which can lead to insufficient adaptation to prevent risks. Small-scale farmers and coastal communities are already facing soft limits to adaptation as measures that they have put in place are not enough to prevent loss. If constraints that are limiting adaptation are addressed, then additional adaptation can take place and these soft limits can be overcome. Evidence on limits to adaptation is largely focused on terrestrial and aquatic species and ecosystems, coastal communities, water security, agricultural production, and human health and heat.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Adaptation is critical for responding to unavoidable climate risks. Greater warming will mean more and more severe impacts requiring a high level of adaptation which may face greater constraints and reach soft and hard limits. At high levels of warming, it may not be possible to adapt to some severe impacts.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 16.3"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 16.3 | How do climate scientists differentiate between impacts of climate change and changes in natural or human systems that occur for other reasons?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-29-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>We can already observe many impacts of climate change today.

This is detection and attribution research. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Global mean temperature has already risen by more than 1°C, and that also means that the impacts of climate change become more visible. Many natural and human systems are sensitive to weather conditions. Crop yields, river floods and associated damages, ecosystems such as coral reefs, or the extent of wildfires are affected by temperatures and precipitation changes. Other factors also come into play. So, for example, crop yields around the world have increased over the last decades because of increasing fertilizer input, improved management and varieties. How do we detect the effect of climate change itself on these systems, when the other factors are excluded? This question is central for impact attribution. ‘Impact of climate change’ is defined as the difference between the observed state of the system (e.g., level of crop yields, damage induced by a river flood, coral bleaching) and the state of the system assuming the same observed levels of non-climate-related drivers (e.g., fertilizer input, land use patterns or settlement structures) but no climate change.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">So:</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">‘Impact of climate change’ is defined as the difference between the observed state of the system and the state of the system assuming the same observed levels of non-climate-related drivers but no climate change. For example, we can compare the level of crop yields, damage induced by a river flood, and coral bleaching with differences in fertilizer input, land use patterns or settlement structures, without climate change and with climate change occurring.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">While this definition is quite clear, there certainly is the problem that, in real life, we do not have a ‘no climate change world’ to compare with. We use model simulations where the influence of climate change can be eliminated to estimate what might have happened without climate change. In a situation where the influence of other non-climate-related drivers is known to be minor (e.g., in very remote locations), the non-climate-change situation can also be approximated by observation from an early period where climate change was still minor. Often, a combination of different approaches increases our confidence in the quantification of the impact of climate change.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Impacts of climate change have been identified in a wide range of natural, human and managed systems. For example, climate change is the major driver of observed widespread shifts in the timing of events in the annual cycle of marine and terrestrial species, and climate change has increased the extent of areas burned by wildfires in certain regions, increased heat-related mortality, and had an impact on the expansion of vector-borne diseases.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">In some other cases, research has made considerable progress in identifying the sensitivity of certain processes to weather conditions without yet attributing observed changes to long-term climate change. Two examples of weather sensitivity without attribution are observed crop price fluctuations and waterborne diseases.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Finally, it is important to note that ‘attribution to climate change’ does not necessarily mean ‘attribution to anthropogenic climate change’. Instead, according to the IPCC definition, climate change means any long-term change in the climate system, no matter where it comes from.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 16.4"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 16.4 | What adaptation-related responses to climate change have already been observed, and do they help reduce climate risk?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-30-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Adaptation-related responses are the actions taken with the intention of managing risks by reducing vulnerability or exposure to climate hazards. Responses are increasing and expanding across global regions and sectors, although there is still a lot of opportunity for improvement. Examining the adequacy and effectiveness of the responses is important to guide planning, implementation and expansion. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The most frequently reported adaptation-related responses are behavioural changes made by individuals and households in response to drought, flooding and rainfall variability in Africa and Asia. Governments are increasingly undertaking planning, and implementing policy and legislation, including, for example, new zoning regulations and building codes, coordination mechanisms, disaster and emergency planning, or extension services to support farmer uptake of drought tolerant crops. Local governments are particularly active in adaptation-related responses, particularly in protecting infrastructure and services, such as water and sanitation. Across all regions, adaptation-related responses are strongly linked to food security, with poverty alleviation a key strategy in the Global South.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Overall, however, the extent of adaptation-related responses globally is low. On average, responses tend to be local, incremental, fragmented, and consistent with Business-As-Usual practices. There are no global regions or sectors where the overall adaptation-related response has been rapid, widespread, substantial and has overcome or challenged key barriers. The extent of adaptation thus remains low globally, with significant potential for increased scope, depth, speed and the challenging of adaptation limits. Examples of low-extent adaptations include shifts by subsistence farmers in crop variety or timing, household flood barriers to protect houses and gardens, and harvesting of water for home and farm use. In contrast, high-extent adaptation means that responses are widespread and coordinated, involve major shifts from normal practices, are rapid, and challenge existing constraints to adaptation. Examples of high-extent adaptations include planned relocation of populations away from increasingly flood-prone areas, and widely implemented social support to communities to prevent migration or displacement due to climate hazards.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Increasing the extent of adaptation-related responses will require more widespread implementation and coordination, more novel and radical shifts from Business-As-Usual practices, more rapid transitions, and challenging or surmounting limits—key barriers—to adaptation. This might include, for example, best-practice programmes implemented in a few communities being expanded to a larger region or country, accelerated implementation of behaviours or regulatory frameworks, coordination mechanisms to support deep structural reform within and across governments, and strategic planning that challenges fundamental norms and underlying constraints to change.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">We have very little information on whether existing adaptation-related responses that have already been implemented are reducing climate risks. There is evidence that risks due to extreme heat and flooding have declined, though it is not clear if these are due to specific adaptation-related responses or general and incremental socioeconomic development. It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of adaptation-related responses, and even more difficult to know whether responses are adequate to adapt to rising climate risk. These remain unknown but important questions in guiding implementation and expansion of adaptation-related responses.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 16.5"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 16.5 | How does climate risk vary with temperature?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-31-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Climate risk is a complex issue, and communicating it is fraught with difficulties. Risk generally increases with global warming, though it depends on a combination of many factors such as exposure, vulnerability and response. To present scientific findings succinctly, a risk variation diagram can help visualise the relationship between warming level and risk. The diagram can be useful in communicating the change in risk with warming for different types of risk across sectors and regions, as well as for five categories of global aggregate risk called ‘Reasons for Concern’. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">A picture speaks a thousand words. The use of images to share ideas and information to convey scientific understanding is an inclusive approach for communicating complex ideas. A risk variation diagram is a simple way to present the risk levels that have been evaluated for any particular system. These diagrams take the form of bar charts where each bar represents a different category of risk. The traffic light colour system is used as a basis for doing the risks, making it universally understandable. These diagrams are known colloquially as ‘burning ember’ diagrams, and have been a cornerstone of IPCC assessments since the Third Assessment Report, and further developed and updated in subsequent reports. The fact that the diagrams are designed to be simple, intuitive and easily understood with the caption alone has contributed to their longstanding effectiveness. Here, in Figure FAQ16.5.1 below, we provide a simplified figure of this chapter’s burning embers for five categories of global aggregate risk, called Reasons for Concern (RFCs), which collectively synthesise how global risk changes with temperature. The diagram shows the levels of concern that scientists have about the consequences of climate change (for a specified risk category and scope), and how this relates to the level of temperature rise.</p><div class="Figure"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure" lang="de-DE"><img alt class="_idGenObjectAttribute-19" id="figure-16-faq-16-5-1" loading="lazy" src="https://ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Figure_16_FAQ_16_5_1.png"></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_Figure_title" lang="en-US"><span class="figure_number" lang>Figure FAQ16.5.1 | </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>Simplified presentation of the five Reasons for Concern burning ember diagrams as assessed in this report (adapted from Figure 16</span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>. </span><span class="bold_condensed-dark-blue" lang>15). </span>The colours indicate the level of risk accrual with global warming for a low-adaptation scenario. RFC1 Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its Indigenous People, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2 Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. RFC3 Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups owing to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. RFC4 Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a single metric, such as monetary damages, lives affected, species lost or ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5 Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused by global warming, such as ice sheet disintegration or thermohaline circulation slowing.</p><div class="ch-figure-button-cont"></div></div><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">In this diagram, the risk variation bars or embers are shown with temperature on the <span class="condensed_italic" lang>y</span>-axis, and the base of the ember corresponds to a baseline temperature. Typically, this baseline temperature is that before global warming started (i.e., average temperatures for the pre-industrial period of 1850–1900). This area of the ember appears white, which indicates no to negligible impacts due to climate change. Moving up the ember bar, changing colours show the increase in risk as the Earth warms globally in terms of degrees Celsius—yellow for moderate risk, red for high risk, and purple for very high risk. Definitions of the risk levels are presented in Figure FAQ16.5.1 The risk transitions are informed by the latest literature and scientific evidence, and developed through consultation and development of consensus among experts. The bars depict an averaged assessment across the world, which has the disadvantage of hiding regional variation. For example, some locations or regions could face high risk even when the global risk level is moderate.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">When the embers for different risk categories are placed next to each other, it is possible to compare risk levels at different levels of global warming. For example, at 1°C warming all embers appear yellow or white, so it is possible to say that keeping global warming below that particular temperature would help ensure risks remain moderate for all five categories of concern assessed. In contrast, at 2°C warming, risk levels have transitioned to high for all categories assessed, and even reach a very high level of risk in the case of unique and threatened systems.</p></div></div><div class="h2-container" id="FAQ 16.6"><h2 class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_subhead" lang="en-GB">FAQ 16.6 | What is the role of extreme weather events in the risks we face from climate change?<span class="arrow-up"></span><span class="arrow-down"></span></h2><div class="h2-siblings" id="h2-32-siblings"><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US"><span class="condensed_italic" lang>Climate change has often been perceived as a slow and gradual process, but by now it is abundantly clear that many of its impacts arise through shocks, such as extreme weather events. Many places are facing more frequent and intense extremes, and also more surprises. The impact of such shocks is shaped by exposure and vulnerability, where we live, and how we are prepared for and able to cope with shocks and surprises. </span></p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">The rising risk of extreme events is one of the major RFCs about climate change. It is clear that this risk has already increased today. Many recent disasters already have a fingerprint of climate change.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">There are large differences in such risks from country to country, place to place, and person to person. This is of course partly due to differences in hazards such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, storms, storm surges, etc., and the way those hazards are influenced by climate change. However, an even more important aspect is people’s exposure and vulnerability: do these hazards occur in places where people live and work, and how badly do they affect people’s lives and livelihoods? Some groups are especially vulnerable, for instance elderly in the case of heatwaves, or people with disabilities in the case of floods. In general, poor and marginalised people tend to be much more affected than rich people, partly because they have fewer reserves and support systems that help them to prepare for, cope with and recover from a shock. On the other hand, absolute economic losses are generally higher in richer places, simply because more assets are at risk there.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Many problems caused by extreme weather do not just appear because of one weather extreme, but due to a combination of several events. For instance, dryness may increase the risk of a subsequent heatwave. But the increased risk may also cascade through human systems, for instance when several consecutive disasters erode people’s savings, or when a heatwave reduces the ability of power plants to produce electricity, which subsequently affects availability of electricity to turn on air conditioning to cope with the heat. Many shocks also have impacts beyond the place where they occur, for instance when a failed harvest affects food prices elsewhere. Climate risks can also be aggravated by other shocks, such as in the case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which not only had a direct health impact, but also affected livelihoods around the world and left many people much more vulnerable to weather extremes.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Understanding the risks we face can help in planning for the future. This may be a combination of short-term preparation, such as early-warning systems, and longer-term strategies to reduce vulnerability, for instance through urban planning, as well as reducing greenhouse gases to avoid longer-term increases in risk. Many interventions to increase people’s resilience are effective in the face of a range of shocks. For instance, social safety nets can help mitigate the impact of a drought on farmers’ livelihoods, but also of the economic impacts of COVID-19.</p><p class="Body_Box_FAQ_FAQ-Box_body" lang="en-US">Climate-related shocks are threats to society, but they can also offer opportunities for learning and change. Recent disasters can motivate action during a short window of opportunity when awareness of the risks is higher and policy attention is focused on solutions to adapt and reduce risk. However, those windows tend to be short, and attention is often directed at the event that was recently experienced, rather than resilience in the face of a wider range of risks.</p></div></div></div><div class="h1-container" id="references"><h1 class="References_References_head" lang="en-GB"><span>References</span> </h1><div class="h1-siblings" id="h1-8-siblings"><p class="References_References_body" id="Abatayo--2020" lang="en-GB">Abatayo, A.L., et al., 2020: Solar geoengineering may lead to excessive cooling and high strategic uncertainty, 13393–13398.</p><p class="References_References_body" id="Abatzoglou--2016" lang="en-GB">Abatzoglou, J.T. and A.P.
