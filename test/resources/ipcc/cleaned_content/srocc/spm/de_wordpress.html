</div>
</div>
<div class="section-content">
<div id="article-introduction-block-1" class="block type-text">
<p><span>All people on Earth depend directly or indirectly on the ocean and cryosphere. The global ocean covers 71% of the Earth surface and contains about 97% of the Earth&#8217;s water. The cryosphere refers to frozen components of the Earth system</span><span>1</span><span>. Around 10% of Earth&#8217;s land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets. The ocean and cryosphere support unique habitats, and are interconnected with other components of the climate system through global exchange of water, energy and carbon. The projected responses of the ocean and cryosphere to past and current human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and ongoing global warming include climate feedbacks, changes over decades to millennia that cannot be avoided, thresholds of abrupt change, and irreversibility. {Box 1.1, 1.2}</span></p>
<p><span>Human communities in close connection with coastal environments, small islands (including Small Island Developing States, SIDS), polar areas and high mountains<sup id="fnref:7" class="bf-footnote" data-fn="7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></span><span> are particularly exposed to ocean and cryosphere change, such as sea level rise, extreme sea level and shrinking cryosphere. Other communities further from the coast are also exposed to changes in the ocean, such as through extreme weather events. Today, around 4 million people live permanently in the Arctic region, of whom 10% are Indigenous. The low-lying coastal zone<sup id="fnref:8" class="bf-footnote" data-fn="8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></span><span> is currently home to around 680 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), projected to reach more than one billion by 2050. SIDS are home to 65 million people. Around 670 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), including Indigenous peoples, live in high mountain regions in all continents except Antarctica. In high mountain regions, population is projected to reach between 740 and 840 million by 2050 (about 8.4&#8211;8.7% of the projected global population). {1.1, 2.1, 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure 2.1}&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to their role within the climate system, such as the uptake and redistribution of natural and anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO</span><span>2</span><span>) and heat, as well as ecosystem support, services provided to people by the ocean and/or cryosphere include food and water supply, renewable energy, and benefits for health and well-being, cultural values, tourism, trade, and transport. The state of the ocean and cryosphere interacts with each aspect of sustainability reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). {1.1, 1.2, 1.5}</span></p>

<h4><b><i>Observed Physical Changes</i></b></h4>
<p><strong>A.1. Over the last decades, global warming has led to widespread shrinking of the cryosphere, with mass loss from ice sheets and glaciers (<i>very</i> <i>high</i> <i>confidence</i>), reductions in snow cover (<i>high confidence</i>) and Arctic sea ice extent and thickness (<i>very</i> <i>high</i> <i>confidence</i>), and increased permafrost temperature (<i>very high confidence</i>). {2.2, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}</strong></p>

Between 2006 and 2015, the Greenland Ice Sheet<sup id="fnref:9" class="bf-footnote" data-fn="9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> lost ice mass at an average rate of 278 &#177; 11 Gt yr&#8211;1 (equivalent to 0.77 &#177; 0.03 mm yr&#8211;1 of global sea level rise)<sup id="fnref:10" class="bf-footnote" data-fn="10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>, mostly due to surface melting (<i>high confidence</i>). In 2006&#8211;2015, the Antarctic Ice Sheet lost mass at an average rate of 155 &#177; 19 Gt yr&#8211;1 (0.43 &#177; 0.05 mm yr&#8211;1), mostly due to rapid thinning and retreat of major outlet glaciers draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (<i>very high confidence</i>). Glaciers worldwide outside Greenland and Antarctica lost mass at an average rate of 220 &#177; 30 Gt yr&#8211;1 (equivalent to 0.61 &#177; 0.08 mm yr&#8211;1 sea level rise) in 2006&#8211;2015. {3.3.1, 4.2.3, Appendix 2.A, Figure SPM.1}</p>

Arctic and boreal permafrost contain 1460&#8211;1600 Gt organic carbon, almost twice the carbon in the atmosphere (</span><i><span>medium confidence</span></i><span>).

These sea ice changes in September are </span><i><span>likely</span></i><span> unprecedented for at least 1000 years. Arctic sea ice has thinned, concurrent with a transition to younger ice: between 1979 and 2018, the areal proportion of multi-year ice at least five years old has declined by approximately 90% (</span><i><span>very high confidence</span></i><span>). Feedbacks from the loss of summer sea ice and spring snow cover on land have contributed to amplified warming in the Arctic (</span><i><span>high confidence</span></i><span>) where surface air temperature </span><i><span>likely</span></i><span> increased by more than double the global average over the last two decades.

Antarctic sea ice extent overall has had no statistically significant trend (1979&#8211;2018) due to contrasting regional signals and large interannual variability (</span><i><span>high confidence</span></i><span>). {3.2.1, 6.3.1, Box 3.1, Box 3.2, SPM A.1.2, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}</span></p>

An approximate steric sea level equivalent is shown with the right axis by multiplying the ocean heat content by the global-mean thermal expansion coefficient (&#949; &#8776; 0.125 m per 1024 Joules)12 for observed warming since 1970 {Figure 5.1}; (h) Global mean surface pH (on the total scale). Assessed observational trends are compiled from open ocean time series sites longer than 15 years {Box 5.1, Figure 5.6, 5.2.2}; and (i) Global mean ocean oxygen change (100&#8211;600 m depth).

By contrast, RCP8.5 is a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario in the absence of policies to combat climate change, leading to continued and sustained growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Compared to the total set of RCPs, RCP8.5 corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. The underlying chapters also reference other scenarios, including RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 that have intermediate levels of greenhouse gas emissions and result in intermediate levels of warming. {Annex I: Glossary, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}</span></p>

For physical changes, yellow/green refers to an increase/decrease, respectively, in amount or frequency of the measured variable. For impacts on ecosystems, human systems and ecosystems services blue or red depicts whether an observed impact is positive (beneficial) or negative (adverse), respectively, to the given system or service. Cells assigned &#8216;increase and decrease&#8217; indicate that within that region, both increase and decrease of physical changes are found, but are not necessarily equal; the same holds for cells showing &#8216;positive and negative&#8217; attributable impacts. For ocean regions, the confidence level refers to the confidence in attributing observed changes to changes in greenhouse gas forcing for physical changes and to climate change for ecosystem, human systems, and ecosystem services. For high mountain and polar land regions, the level of confidence in attributing physical changes and impacts at least partly to a change in the cryosphere is shown. No assessment means: not applicable, not assessed at regional scale, or the evidence is insufficient for assessment. The physical changes in the ocean are defined as: Temperature change in 0&#8211;700 m layer of the ocean except for Southern Ocean (0&#8211;2000 m) and Arctic Ocean (upper mixed layer and major inflowing branches); Oxygen in the 0&#8211;1200 m layer or oxygen minimum layer; Ocean pH as surface pH (decreasing pH corresponds to increasing ocean acidification). Ecosystems in the ocean: Coral refers to warm-water coral reefs and cold-water corals. The &#8216;upper water column&#8217; category refers to epipelagic zone for all ocean regions except Polar Regions, where the impacts on some pelagic organisms in open water deeper than the upper 200 m were included. Coastal wetland includes salt marshes, mangroves and seagrasses. Kelp forests are habitats of a specific group of macroalgae. Rocky shores are coastal habitats dominated by immobile calcified organisms such as mussels and barnacles. Deep sea is seafloor ecosystems that are 3000&#8211;6000 m deep.

<h4>Observed Impacts on People and Ecosystem Services</h4>
<p><strong>A.7. Since the mid-20th century, the shrinking cryosphere in the Arctic and high-mountain areas has led to predominantly negative impacts on food security, water resources, water quality, livelihoods, health and well-being, infrastructure, transportation, tourism and recreation, as well as culture of human societies, particularly for Indigenous peoples (<em>high confidence</em>). Costs and benefits have been unequally distributed across populations and regions. Adaptation efforts have benefited from the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (<em>high confidence</em>). {1.1, 1.5, 1.6.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.4, 3.5, Figure SPM.2}&#160;</strong></p>

These changes have disrupted access to, and food availability within, herding, hunting, fishing, and gathering areas, harming the livelihoods and cultural identity of Arctic residents including Indigenous populations (<em>high confidence</em>). Glacier retreat and snow cover changes have contributed to localized declines in agricultural yields in some high mountain regions, including Hindu Kush Himalaya and the tropical Andes (<em>medium confidence</em>). {2.3.1, 2.3.7, Box 2.4, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.5.2, Figure SPM.2}</span></p>

In some high-mountain areas, water quality has been affected by contaminants, particularly mercury, released from melting glaciers and thawing permafrost (<em>medium confidence</em>). Health-related adaptation efforts in the Arctic range from local to international in scale, and successes have been underpinned by Indigenous knowledge (<em>high confidence</em>). {1.8, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1, 2.3.1, 3.4.3}</span></p>

The three left panels represent the simulated (a,b) and observed (c) mean values for the recent past (1986&#8211;2005), the middle and right panels represent projected changes (%) by 2081&#8211;2100 relative to recent past under low (RCP2.6) and high (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emissions scenario {Box SPM.1}, respectively. Total animal biomass in the recent past (b, left panel) represents the projected total animal biomass by each spatial pixel relative to the global average. (c) *Average observed fisheries catch in the recent past (based on data from the Sea Around Us global fisheries database); projected changes in maximum fisheries catch potential in shelf seas are based on the average outputs from two fisheries and marine ecosystem models. To indicate areas of model inconsistency, shaded areas represent regions where models disagree in the direction of change for more than: (a) and (b) 3 out of 10 model projections, and (c) one out of two models. Although unshaded, the projected change in the Arctic and Antarctic regions in (b) total animal biomass and (c) fisheries catch potential have low confidence due to uncertainties associated with modelling multiple interacting drivers and ecosystem responses. Projections presented in (b) and (c) are driven by changes in ocean physical and biogeochemical conditions e.g., temperature, oxygen level, and net primary production projected from CMIP5 Earth system models. **The epipelagic refers to the uppermost part of the ocean with depth &lt;200 m from the surface where there is enough sunlight to allow photosynthesis. (d) Assessment of risks for coastal and open ocean ecosystems based on observed and projected climate impacts on ecosystem structure, functioning and biodiversity. Impacts and risks are shown in relation to changes in Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) relative to pre-industrial level. Since assessments of risks and impacts are based on global mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST), the corresponding SST levels are shown<sup id="fnref:29" class="bf-footnote" data-fn="29"><a href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">29</a></sup>. The assessment of risk transitions is described in Chapter 5 Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.2.5 and 5.3.7 and Supplementary Materials SM5.3, Table SM5.6, Table SM5.8 and other parts of the underlying report. The figure indicates assessed risks at approximate warming levels and increasing climate-related hazards in the ocean: ocean warming, acidification, deoxygenation, increased density stratification, changes in carbon fluxes, sea level rise, and increased frequency and/or intensity of extreme events. The assessment considers the natural adaptive capacity of the ecosystems, their exposure and vulnerability. Impact and risk levels do not consider risk reduction strategies such as human interventions, or future changes in non-climatic drivers. Risks for ecosystems were assessed by considering biological, biogeochemical, geomorphological and physical aspects. Higher risks associated with compound effects of climate hazards include habitat and biodiversity loss, changes in species composition and distribution ranges, and impacts/risks on ecosystem structure and functioning, including changes in animal/plant biomass and density, productivity, carbon fluxes, and sediment transport. As part of the assessment, literature was compiled and data extracted into a summary table. A multi-round expert elicitation process was undertaken with independent evaluation of threshold judgement, and a final consensus discussion. Further information on methods and underlying literature can be found in Chapter 5, Sections 5.2 and 5.3 and Supplementary Material. {3.2.3, 3.2.4, 5.2, 5.3, 5.2.5, 5.3.7, SM5.6, SM5.8, Figure 5.16, Cross Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1 Table CCB1}</p>

<h4>Challenges</h4>
<p><strong>C.1. Impacts of climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere increasingly challenge current governance efforts to develop and implement adaptation responses from local to global scales, and in some cases pushing them to their limits. People with the highest exposure and vulnerability are often those with lowest capacity to respond (<em>high confidence</em>). {1.5, 1.7, Cross-Chapter Boxes 2&#8211;3 in Chapter 1, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, 2.4, 3.2.4, 3.4.3, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 4.1, 4.3.3, 4.4.3, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 6.9}</strong></p>

Such temporal differences challenge the ability of societies to adequately prepare for and respond to long-term changes including shifts in the frequency and intensity of extreme events (<em>high confidence</em>). Examples include changing landslides and floods in high mountain regions and risks to important species and ecosystems in the Arctic, as well as to low-lying nations and islands, small island nations, other coastal regions and to coral reef ecosystems. {2.3.2, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.3, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 6.9}</p>

The capacity of governance systems in polar and ocean regions to respond to climate change impacts has strengthened recently, but this development is not sufficiently rapid or robust to adequately address the scale of increasing projected risks (<em>high confidence</em>).

<h4>Enabling Conditions</h4>
<p><strong>C.4. Enabling climate resilience and sustainable development depends critically on urgent and ambitious emissions reductions coupled with coordinated sustained and increasingly ambitious adaptation actions (<i>very high confidence</i>). Key enablers for implementing effective responses to climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere include intensifying cooperation and coordination among governing authorities across spatial scales and planning horizons. Education and climate literacy, monitoring and forecasting, use of all available knowledge sources, sharing of data, information and knowledge, finance, addressing social vulnerability and equity, and institutional support are also essential.

Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99&#8211;100% probability, very likely 90&#8211;100%, likely 66&#8211;100%, about as likely as not 33&#8211;66%, unlikely 0&#8211;33%, very unlikely 0&#8211;10%, exceptionally unlikely 0&#8211;1%. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the other AR6 Special Reports. Additional terms (extremely likely 95&#8211;100%, more likely than not &gt;50&#8211;100%, more unlikely than likely 0&#8211;&lt;50%, extremely unlikely 0&#8211;5%) are used when appropriate. This Report also uses the term &#8216;likely range&#8217; or &#8216;very likely range&#8217; to indicate that the assessed likelihood of an outcome lies within the 17-83% or 5-95% probability range. {1.9.2, Figure 1.4}
