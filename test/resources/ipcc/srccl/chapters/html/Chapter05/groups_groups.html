Thus, GHG emissions from agriculture result, in large part, from ‘pull’ from the demand side.

Hidden hunger tends to be present in countries with high levels of undernourishment (Muthayya et al. 2013), but micronutrient deficiency can occur in societies with low prevalence of undernourishment. For example, in many parts of the world teenage girls suffer from iron deficiency (Whitfield et al. 2015) and calcium deficiency is common in Western-style diets (Aslam and Varani 2016). Food security is related to nutrition, and conversely food insecurity is related to malnutrition. Not all malnourishment arises from food insecurity, as households may have access to healthy diets but choose to eat unhealthily, or it may arise from illness. However, in many parts of the world, poverty is linked to poor diets (FAO et al. 2018). This may be through lack of resources to produce or access food in general, or healthy food, in particular, as healthier diets are more expensive than diets rich in calories but poor in nutrition </span><span style="x0: 422.52; x1: 425.16; y0: 567.19; y1: 576.69; width: 2.64; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="422.52" y0="567.19" x1="482.06" class="s1068">(high confidence</span><span style="x0: 482.06; x1: 484.7; y0: 567.19; y1: 576.69; width: 2.64; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="482.06" y0="567.19" x1="566.12" class="s1063">) (see meta-analysis by Darmon and Drewnowski 2015).

However, in the USA, USDA estimates 40 million people were exposed to varying degrees of food insecurity, from mild to severe (overall prevalence about 12%) (Coleman-Jensen et al. 2018). In the UK, estimates from 2017 and 2018 indicate about 4 million adults are moderately to severely food insecure (prevalence 8%) (End Hunger UK 2018; Bates et al. 2017). The UK food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, over a year in 2017/18, distributed 1,332,952 three-day emergency food parcels to people referred to the charity as being in food crisis. Furthermore, a 2003 study in the UK (Schenker 2003) estimated that 40% of adults, and 15% of children admitted to hospitals were malnourished, and that 70% of undernourishment in the UK was unreported.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="519.2"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 519.2; y1: 528.7; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="519.2" x1="566.11" class="s1063">In total, more than half the world’s population are underweight or overweight (NCD-RisC 2017a), so their diets do not provide the conditions for ‘an active and healthy life’.

Poverty, along with socio-economic and political marginalisation, cumulatively put women, children and the elderly in a disadvantaged position in coping with the adverse impacts of the changing climate (UNDP 2013; Skoufias et al. 2011). The contextual vulnerability of women is higher due to their differentiated relative power, roles, and responsibilities at the household and community levels (Bryan and Behrman 2013; Nelson et al. 2002). They often have a higher reliance on subsistence agriculture, which will be severely impacted by climate change (Aipira et al. 2017). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="195.13"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 195.13; y1: 204.63; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="195.13" x1="566.09" class="s1063">Through impacts on food prices (Section 5.2.3.1) poor people’s food security is particularly threatened. Decreased yields can impact nutrient intake of the poor by decreasing supplies of highly nutritious crops and by promoting adaptive behaviours that may substitute crops that are resilient but less nutritious (Thompson et al. 2012; Lobell and Burke 2010). In Guatemala, food prices and poverty have been correlated with lower micronutrient intakes (Iannotti et al. 2012). In the developed world, poverty is more typically associated with calorically-dense but nutrient-poor diets, obesity, overweight, and other related diseases (Darmon and Drewnowski 2015).</span></div><div left="595.24" right="601.48" top="268.29"><span style="x0: 595.24; x1: 601.48; y0: 268.29; y1: 280.29; width: 6.24; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0];" x0="595.24" y0="268.29" x1="601.48" class="s1062">5</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.24" top="735.11"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 735.11; y1: 744.61; width: 4.93; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="65.2" y0="735.11" x1="313.24" class="s1063">Rural areas are especially affected by climate change (Dasgupta et al. 2014), through impacts on agriculture-related livelihoods and rural income (Mendelsohn et al. 2007) and through impacts on employment. Jessoe et al. (2018) using a 28-year panel on individual employment in rural Mexico, found that years with a high occurrence of heat lead to a reduction in local employment by up to 1.4% with a medium emissions scenario, particularly for wage work and non-farm labour, with impacts on food access. Without employment opportunities in areas where extreme poverty is prevalent, people may be forced to migrate, exacerbating potential for ensuing conflicts (FAO 2018a).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="603.12"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.24; y0: 603.12; y1: 612.62; width: 4.05; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="65.2" y0="603.12" x1="313.23" class="s1063">Finally, climate change can affect human health in other ways that interact with food utilisation. In many parts of the world where agriculture relies still on manual labour, projections are that heat stress will reduce the hours people can work, and increase their risk (Dunne et al. 2013). For example, Takakura et al. (2017) estimates that under RCP8.5, the global economic loss from people working shorter hours to mitigate heat loss may be 2.4–4% of GDP. Furthermore, as discussed by Watts et al. (2018); people’s nutritional status interacts with other stressors and affects their susceptibility to ill health (the ‘utilisation pillar’ of food security): so food-insecure people are more likely to be adversely affected by extreme heat, for example.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.8" top="675.14"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 675.14; y1: 684.64; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="675.14" x1="571.8" class="s1063">In the case of food price hikes, those more vulnerable are more affected (Uraguchi 2010), especially in urban areas (Ruel et al. 2010), where livelihood impacts are particularly severe for the individuals and groups that have scarce resources or are socially isolated (Revi et al. 2014; Gasper et al. 2011) (</span><span style="x0: 438.28; x1: 442.86; y0: 627.15; y1: 636.65; width: 4.58; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="438.28" y0="627.15" x1="495.24" class="s1068">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 495.24; x1: 497.88; y0: 627.15; y1: 636.65; width: 2.64; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="495.24" y0="627.15" x1="571.77" class="s1063">). These people often lack power and access to resources, adequate urban services and functioning infrastructure. As climate events become more frequent and intense, this can increase the scale and depth of urban poverty (Rosenzweig et al. 2018b).

In many rural areas women often grow most of the crops for domestic consumption and are primarily responsible for storing, processing, and preparing food; handling livestock; gathering food, fodder and fuelwood; managing domestic water supply; and providing most of the labour for post-harvest activities (FAO 2011a).

Water scarcity can particularly affect women because they need to spend more time and energy to collect water, where they may be more exposed to physical and sexual violence (Sommer et al. 2015; Aipira et al. 2017). They may be forced to use unsafe water in the household increasing risk of water-borne diseases (Parikh 2009).

Implementing them substantially reduces the risks of crossing the 2°C threshold and contributes to achievement of the SDGs (Haines et al. 2017; Shindell et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="285.82" top="326.98"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.73; y0: 326.98; y1: 336.98; width: 5.2; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="59.53" y0="326.98" x1="285.82" class="s10">1.2.2 Climate change impacts on food availability </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.59" top="303.11"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.63; y0: 303.11; y1: 312.61; width: 5.1; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="303.11" x1="307.59" class="s1063">Climate change impacts food availability through its effect on the production of food and its storage, processing, distribution, and exchange.</span></div><div left="59.53" right="203.1" top="254.98"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.33; y0: 254.98; y1: 264.98; width: 4.8; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="59.53" y0="254.98" x1="203.1" class="s101">1.2.2.1 Impacts on crop production</span></div><div left="59.53" right="134.57" top="231.11"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 65.68; y0: 231.11; y1: 240.61; width: 6.16; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="231.11" x1="134.57" class="s1116">Observed impacts. </span><span style="x0: 135.1; x1: 139.32; y0: 231.11; y1: 240.61; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="135.1" y0="231.11" x1="307.62" class="s1063">Since AR5, there have been further studies that document impacts of climate change on crop production and related variables (Supplementary Material Table SM5.3).

Rice yield increases have also been found over a similar period (Wang et al. 2014). Multiple factors, such as structural adjustment, scientific and technological progress, and government policies, along with regional warming (1.43°C in the past century) (Fenghua et al. 2006) have been put forward as contributing to the observed expanded rice areas and yield in the region.

Industrial systems will suffer most from indirect impacts leading to rises in the costs of water, feeding, housing, transport and the destruction of infrastructure due to extreme events, as well as an increasing volatility of the price of feedstuff which increases the level of uncertainty in production (Rivera-Ferre et al. 2016b; Lopez-i-Gelats 2014). Mixed systems and industrial or landless livestock systems could encounter several risk factors mainly due to the variability of grain availability and cost, and low adaptability of animal genotypes (Nardone et al. 2010). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="315.13"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.63; y0: 315.13; y1: 324.63; width: 5.1; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="315.13" x1="307.6" class="s1063">Considering the diverse typologies of animal production, from grazing to industrial, Rivera-Ferre et al.

Considering vulnerabilities, they grouped the impacts as those impacting the animal directly, such as heat and cold stress, water stress, physical damage during extremes; and others impacting their environment, such as modification in the geographical distribution of vector-borne diseases, location, quality and quantity of feed and water and destruction of livestock farming infrastructures. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.59" top="183.15"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 67.09; y0: 183.15; y1: 192.65; width: 7.56; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="183.15" x1="307.59" class="s1063">With severe negative impacts due to drought and high frequency of extreme events, the average gain of productivity might be cancelled by the volatility induced by increasing variability in the weather.

For instance, in China changes in precipitation were a more important factor in nomadic migration than temperature (Pei and Zhang 2014). There is some evidence that recent years have already seen an increase in grassland fires in parts of China and tropical Asia (IPCC 2012). In Mongolia, grassland productivity has declined by 20–30% over the latter half of the 20th century, and ewe average weight reduced by 4 kg on an annual basis, or about 8% since 1980 (Batima et al. 2008). Substantial decline in cattle herd sizes can be due to increased mortality and forced off-take (Megersa et al. 2014). Important, but less studied, is the impact of the interaction of grazing patterns with climate change on grassland composition. Spence et al.

Sami reindeer herders in Finland showed reduced freedom of action in response to climate change due to loss of habitat, increased predation, and presence of economic and legal constraints (Tyler et al. 2007; Pape and Löffler 2012).

On a global basis, some 1500 crops require pollination (typically by insects, birds and bats) (Klein et al. 2007). Their importance to nutritional security is therefore perhaps under-rated by valuation methodologies, which, nonetheless, include estimates of the global value of pollination services at over 225 billion USD2010 (Hanley et al. 2015).

Disruption can occur through changes in species’ ranges or by changes in timing of growth stages (Settele et al. 2016). For example, if plant development responds to different cues (e.g., day length) from insects (e.g., temperature), the emergence of insects may not match the flowering times of the plants, causing a reduction in pollination. Climate change will affect pollinator ranges depending on species, life-history, dispersal ability and location. Warren et al. (2018) estimate that under a 3.2°C warming scenario, the existing range of about 49% of insects will be reduced by half by 2100, suggesting either significant range changes (if dispersal occurs) or extinctions (if it does not).

Long-term impacts may include scarcity of wild seed, limited access to freshwater for farming due to reduced precipitation, limited access to feeds from marine and terrestrial sources, decreased productivity due to suboptimal farming conditions, eutrophication and other perturbations.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="87.13"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.76; y0: 87.13; y1: 96.63; width: 4.05; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="87.13" x1="571.77" class="s1063">FAO (2014a) assessed the vulnerability of aquaculture stakeholders to non-climate change drivers, which add to climate change hazards.

In areas where vulnerability to climate change is heightened, increased exposure to climate change variables and impacts is likely to exacerbate current inequalities in the societies concerned, penalising further already disadvantaged groups such as migrant fishers (e.g., Lake Chad) or women (e.g., employees in Chile’s processing industry) (FAO 2014a).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="579.12"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 579.12; y1: 588.62; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="579.12" x1="307.58" class="s1063">In many countries the projected declines co-occur across both marine fisheries and agricultural crops (Blanchard et al. 2017), both of which will impact the aquaculture and livestock sectors (Supplementary Material Figure SM5.1).

Farm households in the developing world often rely on a complex mix of crops, livestock, aquaculture, and non-agricultural activities for their livelihoods (Rosenzweig and Hillel 2015; Antle et al. 2015). Across the world, smallholder farmers are considered to be disproportionately vulnerable to climate change because changes in temperature, rainfall and the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events directly affect their crop and animal productivity as well as their household’s food security, income and well-being (Vignola et al. 2015; Harvey et al. 2014b). For example, smallholder farmers in the Philippines, whose survival and livelihood largely depend on the environment, constantly face risks and bear the impacts of the changing climate (Peria et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="267.13"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 267.13; y1: 276.63; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="267.13" x1="307.58" class="s1063">Smallholder farming systems have been recognised as highly vulnerable to climate change (Morton, 2007) because they are highly dependent on agriculture and livestock for their livelihood (</span><span style="x0: 289.43; x1: 294.01; y0: 243.13; y1: 252.63; width: 4.58; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="289.43" y0="243.13" x1="307.54" class="s1068">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 98.41; x1: 101.05; y0: 231.13; y1: 240.63; width: 2.64; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="98.41" y0="231.13" x1="307.59" class="s1063">) (Dasgupta et al. 2014). In Zimbabwe, farmers were found vulnerable due to their marginal location, low levels of technology, and lack of other essential farming resources. Farmers observed high frequency and severity of drought; excessive precipitation; drying of rivers, dams and wells; and changes in timing and pattern of seasons as evidence of climate change, and indicated that prolonged wet, hot, and dry weather conditions resulted in crop damage, death of livestock, soil erosion, bush fires, poor plant germination, pests, lower incomes, and deterioration of infrastructure (Mutekwa 2009). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.59" top="111.15"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 111.15; y1: 120.65; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="111.15" x1="307.59" class="s1063">In Madagascar, Harvey et al. (2014b) surveyed 600 small farmers and found that chronic food insecurity, physical isolation and lack of access to formal safety nets increased Malagasy farmers’ vulnerability to any shocks to their agricultural system, particularly extreme events. In Chitwan, Nepal, occurrence of extreme events and increased variability in temperature has increased the vulnerability of crops to biotic and abiotic stresses and altered the timing of agricultural operations; thereby affecting crop production (Paudel et al. 2014). In Lesotho, a study on subsistence farming found that food crops were the most vulnerable to weather, followed by soil and livestock. Climate variables of major concern were hail, drought and dry spells which reduced crop yields. In the Peruvian Altiplano, Sietz et al. (2012) evaluated smallholders’ vulnerability to weather extremes with regard to food security and found that resource scarcity (livestock, land area), diversification of activities (lack of alternative income, education deprivation) and income restrictions (harvest failure risk) shaped the vulnerability of smallholders.

Previous studies have found that decreased agricultural productivity will depress agricultural supply, leading to price increases. Despite different economic models with various representations of the global food system (Valin et al. 2014; Robinson et al. 2014; Nelson et al. 2013; Schmitz et al. 2014), as well as having represented the SSPs in different ways, for example, technological change, land-use policies, and sustainable diets (Stehfest et al. 2019; Hasegawa et al. 2018), the ensemble of participating models projected a 1–29% cereal price increase in 2050 across SSPs 1, 2 and 3 due to climate change (RCP 6.0). This would impact consumers globally through higher food prices, though regional effects will vary. The median cereal price increase was 7%, given current projections of demand. In all cases (across SSPs and global economic models), prices are projected to increase for rice and coarse grains, with only one instance of a price decline (–1%) observed for wheat in SSP1, with price increases projected in all other cases. Animal-sourced foods (ASFs) are also projected to see price increases (1%), but the range of projected price changes are about half those of cereals, highlighting that the climate impacts on ASFs will be felt indirectly, through the cost and availability of feed, and that there is significant scope for feed substitution within the livestock sector. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="507.14"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.5; y0: 507.14; y1: 516.64; width: 5.45; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="507.14" x1="566.11" class="s1063">Declining food availability caused by climate change is likely to lead to increasing food cost impacting consumers globally through higher prices and reduced purchasing power, with low-income consumers particularly at risk from higher food prices (Nelson et al. 2010; Springmann et al. 2016a and Nelson et al. 2018). Higher prices depress consumer demand, which in turn will not only reduce energy intake (calories) globally (Hasegawa et al. 2015; Nelson et al. 2010; Springmann et al. 2016a and Hasegawa et al. 2018), but will also likely lead to less healthy diets with lower availability of key micronutrients (Nelson et al. 2018) and increase diet-related mortality in lower and middle-income countries (Springmann et al. 2016a). These changes will slow progress towards the eradication of malnutrition in all its forms. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="351.16"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 351.16; y1: 360.66; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="351.16" x1="566.11" class="s1063">The extent that reduced energy intake leads to a heightened risk of hunger varies by global economic model.

This median percentage increase would be the equivalent of 8, 24 and 80 million (full range 1–183 million) additional people at risk of hunger due to climate change (Hasegawa et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="433.65" top="230.98"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 230.98; y1: 240.98; width: 4.8; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="318.05" y0="230.98" x1="433.65" class="s101">1.2.3.2 Impacts on land use</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.05" top="207.11"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 207.11; y1: 216.61; width: 5.1; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="207.11" x1="566.05" class="s1063">Climate change is likely to lead to changes in land use globally (Nelson et al. 2014; Schmitz et al. 2014 and Wiebe et al. 2015).

This may decrease protein and mineral nutrient concentrations, as well as alter lipid composition (DaMatta et al. 2010).

This has led to changes in acidity, firmness, and water content, reducing quality (Sugiura et al. 2013). In other fruit, such as grapes, warming-induced changes in sugar composition affect both colour and aroma (Mira de Orduña 2010).

However, there is no agreement on how to better use emergency food aid, since it can come with unintended consequences for individuals, groups, regions, and countries (Barrett 2006).

However, if unabated climate change continues, limits to adaptation will be reached (SR15). In the food system, adaptation actions involve any activities designed to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience of the system to climate change. In some areas, expanded climate envelopes will alter agroecological zones, with opportunity for expansion towards higher latitudes and altitudes, soil and water resources permitting (Rosenzweig and Hillel 2015).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="591.12"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 325.44; y0: 591.12; y1: 600.62; width: 7.39; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="591.12" x1="566.08" class="s1063">More extreme climatic events are projected to lead to more agrometeorological disasters with associated economic and social losses. There are many options for adapting the food system to extreme events reported in IPCC (2012), highlighting measures that reduce exposure and vulnerability and increase resilience, even though risks cannot fully be eliminated (IPCC 2012). Adaptation responses to extreme events aim to minimise damages, modify threats, prevent adverse impacts, or share losses, thus making the system more resilient (Harvey et al. 2014a). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="471.14"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 325.61; y0: 471.14; y1: 480.64; width: 7.56; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="471.14" x1="566.11" class="s1063">With current and projected climate change (higher temperature, changes in precipitation, flooding and extremes events), achieving adaptation will require both technological (e.g., recovering and improving orphan crops, new cultivars from breeding or biotechnology) and non-technological (e.g., markets, land management, dietary change) solutions.

Transformational adaptation seeks alternative livelihoods and land-use strategies needed to develop new farming systems (Termeer et al. 2016). For example, limitations in incremental adaptation among smallholder rice farmers in Northwest Costa Rica led to a shift from rice to sugarcane production due to decreasing market access and water scarcity (Warner et al. 2015). Migration from the Oldman River Basin has been described as a transformational adaption to climate change in the Canadian agriculture sector (Hadarits et al. 2017). If high-end scenarios of climate change eventuate, the food security of farmers and consumers will depend on how transformational change in food systems is managed. An integrated framework of adaptive transition – management of socio-technical transitions and adaptation to socio-ecological changes – may help build transformational adaptive capacity (Mockshell and Kamanda 2018 and Pant et al. 2015). Rippke et al. (2016) has suggested overlapping phases of adaptation needed to support transformational change in Africa. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="428.08" top="518.98"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 518.98; y1: 528.98; width: 4.8; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="318.05" y0="518.98" x1="428.08" class="s101">1.3.2.2 Risk management </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="495.11"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 495.11; y1: 504.61; width: 5.1; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="495.11" x1="566.11" class="s1063">Climate risks affect all pillars of food security, particularly stability because extreme events lead to strong variation to food access.

Neglected and Underutilised Species (NUS) have a potential to improve food security and at the same time help protect and conserve traditional knowledge and biodiversity. Scaling-up NUS requires training farmers and other stakeholders on ways to adopt adequate crop management, quality seed, select varieties, farming systems, soil management, development of new products, and market opportunities (Padulosi et al. 2013). Farmers in the Rasuwa district, in the mid-hills of Nepal, prefer to cultivate local bean, barley, millet and local maize, rather than commodity crops because they are more tolerant to water stress and extremely cold conditions (Adhikari et al. 2017).

Various factors are responsible for this, and lack of diversity in food and nutrition resulting from production and consumption of few crops is one of them. In the past, food baskets in this region consisted of many different edible plant species, many of which are now neglected and underutilised. This is because almost all the efforts of the Green Revolution after 1960 focused on major crops. Four crops, namely rice, wheat, maize and potato, account for about 60% of global plant-derived energy supply (Padulosi et al. 2013). </span></div><div left="79.68" right="557.6" top="483.13"><span style="x0: 79.68; x1: 87.24; y0: 483.13; y1: 492.63; width: 7.56; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="79.68" y0="483.13" x1="557.6" class="s1063">While the Green Revolution technologies substantially increased the yield of few crops and allowed countries to reduce hunger, they also resulted in inappropriate and excessive use of agrochemicals, inefficient water use, loss of beneficial biodiversity, water and soil pollution and significantly reduced crop and varietal diversity.

Neglected and Underutilised Species (NUS) have a potential to improve food security and at the same time help protect\nand conserve traditional knowledge and biodiversity. Scaling-up NUS requires training farmers and other stakeholders on ways to\nadopt adequate crop management, quality seed, select varieties, farming systems, soil management, development of new products,\nand market opportunities (Padulosi et al. 2013). Farmers in the Rasuwa district, in the mid-hills of Nepal, prefer to cultivate local\nbean, barley, millet and local maize, rather than commodity crops because they are more tolerant to water stress and extremely\ncold conditions (Adhikari et al. 2017). Farmers in the high-altitude, cold climate of Nepal prefer local barley with its short growing\nperiod because of a shorter growing window. Buckwheat is commonly grown in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan (HKH) region mainly\nbecause it grows fast and suppresses weeds. In Pakistan, quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) grew and produced well under saline\nand marginal soil where other crops would not grow (Adhikari et al. 2017).</td>

In the past, food baskets in this region consisted of many different edible plant species, many of which are now neglected and\nunderutilised. This is because almost all the efforts of the Green Revolution after 1960 focused on major crops.

Acknowledging that indigenous cultures across the world are supporting many string strategies and beliefs that offer sustainable systems with pragmatic solutions will help move forward the food and climate sustainability policies. For instance, in the Sahel, the local populations have developed and implemented various adaptation strategies that sustain their resilience despite many threats (Nyong et al. 2007).

Recent studies showed that supply-side adaptation measures alone will not be sufficient to sustainably achieve food security under climate change (Springmann et al. 2018b; Swinburn et al. 2019; Bajželj et al. 2014). As noted by Godfray (2015), people with higher income demand more varied diets, and typically ones that are richer in meat and other food types that require more resources to produce. Therefore, both supply-side (production, processing, transport, and trade) and demand-side solutions (for example, changing diets, food loss and waste reduction) can be effective in adapting to climate change (Creutzig et al. 2016) (see Section 5.5.2.5 for food loss and waste). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.59" top="291.12"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 291.12; y1: 300.62; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="291.12" x1="307.59" class="s1063">The implications of dietary choice can have severe consequences for land. For example, Alexander et al. (2016), found that if every country were to adopt the UK’s 2011 average diet and meat consumption, 95% of global habitable land area would be needed for agriculture – up from 50% of land currently used. For the average USA diet, 178% of global land would be needed (relative to 2011) (Alexander et al. 2016); and for ‘business as usual’ dietary trends and existing rates of improvement in yields, 55% more land would be needed above baseline (2009) (Bajželj et al. 2014). Changing dietary habits have been suggested as an effective food route to affect land use (Beheshti et al. 2017) and promote adaptation to climate change through food demand. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.61" top="147.14"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 66.92; y0: 147.14; y1: 156.64; width: 7.39; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="147.14" x1="307.61" class="s1063">Most literature has focused on demand-side options that analyse the effects on climate change mitigation by dietary changes. Little focus has been brought on demand-side adaptation measures to adjust the demand to the food challenges related to drivers such as market, climate change, inputs limitations (for example, fossil fuels, nitrogen, phosphorus), food access, and quality. Adding to that, the high cost of nutritious foods contributes to a higher risk of overweight and obesity (FAO 2018d). Adaptation measures relate also to the implications of easy access to inexpensive, high-calorie, low-nutrition foods which have been shown to lead to malnutrition (Section 5.1). Therefore, adaptation related to diet may be weighed against the negative side effects on health of current food choices. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="675.16"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.98; y0: 675.16; y1: 684.66; width: 4.93; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="675.16" x1="566.07" class="s1063">Reduction in the demand for animal-based food products and increasing proportions of plant-based foods in diets, particularly pulses and nuts; and replacing red meat</span><span style="x0: 472.11; x1: 477.59; y0: 651.48; y1: 659.48; width: 5.48; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="472.11" y0="651.48" x1="479.36" class="s1419">wi</span><span style="x0: 479.36; x1: 482.18; y0: 651.11; y1: 660.61; width: 2.81; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="479.36" y0="651.11" x1="566.1" class="s1063">th other more efficient protein sources are demand-side adaptation measures (Machovina et al. 2015) (Section 5.5.2).

Similarly, reducing waste at all points along the entire food chain is a significant opportunity for improving demand-side adaptation measures (Godfray 2015). </span></div><div left="318.04" right="566.07" top="435.13"><span style="x0: 318.04; x1: 320.34; y0: 435.13; y1: 444.63; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.04" y0="435.13" x1="566.07" class="s1063">It is important to highlight the opportunities for improving the feed-to-meat conversion considered as a form of food loss.

CBA represents bottom-up approaches and localised adaptation measures where social dynamics serve as the power to respond to the impacts of climate change (Ayers and Forsyth 2009). It identifies, assists, and implements development activities that strengthen the capacity of local people to adapt to living in a riskier and less predictable climate, while ensuring their food security. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="303.12"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.46; y0: 303.12; y1: 312.62; width: 4.93; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="303.12" x1="307.57" class="s1063">Klenk et al. (2017) found that mobilisation of local knowledge can inform adaptation decision-making and may facilitate greater flexibility in government-funded research. As an example, rural innovation in terrace agriculture developed on the basis of a local coping mechanism and adopted by peasant farmers in Latin America may serve as an adaptation option to climate change (Bocco and Napoletano, 2017). Clemens et al. (2015) indicated that learning alliances provided social learning and knowledge-sharing in Vietnam through an open dialogue platform that provided incentives and horizontal exchange of ideas.</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="171.14"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.63; y0: 171.14; y1: 180.64; width: 5.1; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="171.14" x1="307.58" class="s1063">Community-based adaptation generates strategies through participatory processes, involving local stakeholders and development and disaster risk reduction practitioners. Fostering collaboration and community stewardship is central to the success of CBA (Scott et al. 2017). Preparedness behaviours that are encouraged include social connectedness, education, training, and messaging; CBA also can encompass beliefs that might improve household preparedness to climate disaster risk (Thomas et al. 2015). Reliance on social networks, social groups connectivities, or moral economies reflect the importance of collaboration within communities (Reuter 2018; </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.08" top="579.15"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.97; y0: 579.15; y1: 588.65; width: 4.92; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="579.15" x1="566.08" class="s1063">Yet, community-based adaptation also needs to consider methods that engage with the drivers of vulnerability as part of community-based approaches, particularly questions of power, culture, identity and practice (Ensor et al. 2018). The goal is to avoid maladaptation or exacerbation of existing inequalities within the communities (Buggy and McNamara 2016). For example, in the Pacific Islands, elements considered in a CBA plan included people’s development aspirations; immediate economic, social and environmental benefits; dynamics of village governance, social rules and protocols; and traditional forms of knowledge that could inform sustainable solutions (Remling and Veitayaki 2016). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="435.17"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 325.61; y0: 435.17; y1: 444.67; width: 7.56; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="435.17" x1="566.12" class="s1063">With these considerations, community-based adaptation can help to link local adaptation with international development and climate change policies (Forsyth 2013). In developing CBA programmes, barriers exist that may hinder implementation. These include poor coordination within and between organisations implementing adaptation options, poor skills, poor knowledge about climate change, and inadequate communication among stakeholders (Spires et al. 2014). A rights-based approach has been suggested to address issues of equality, transparency, accountability and empowerment in adaptation to climate change (Ensor et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="303.19"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 303.19; y1: 312.69; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="303.19" x1="566.12" class="s1063">In summary, institutional measures, including risk management, policies, and planning at global, national, and local scales can support adaptation. Advance planning and focus on institutions can aid in guiding decision-making processes and foster resilience. There is evidence that institutional measures can support the scaling up of adaptation and thus there is reason to believe that systemic resilience is achievable.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="430.25" top="194.98"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.25; y0: 194.98; y1: 204.98; width: 5.2; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="318.05" y0="194.98" x1="430.25" class="s10">1.3.6 Tools and finance</span></div><div left="318.05" right="441.77" top="170.98"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 170.98; y1: 180.98; width: 4.8; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="318.05" y0="170.98" x1="441.77" class="s101">1.3.6.1 Early warning systems</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="147.11"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 325.44; y0: 147.11; y1: 156.61; width: 7.39; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="147.11" x1="566.09" class="s1063">Many countries and regions in the world have adopted early warning systems (EWS) to cope with climate variability and change as it helps to reduce interruptions and improve response times before and after extreme weather events (Ibrahim and Kruczkiewicz 2016).

Fenton &amp; Paavola, 2015; Dowla, 2018). Hammill et al. (2010) found that microfinance services (MFS) are especially helpful for the poor. MFS can provide poor people with the means to diversify, accumulate and manage the assets needed to become less susceptible to shocks and stresses. As a result, MFS plays an important role in vulnerability reduction and climate change adaptation among some of the poor. The provision of small-scale financial products to low-income and otherwise disadvantaged groups by financial institutions can serve as adaptation to climate change. Access to finance in the context of climate change adaptation that focuses on poor households and women in particular is bringing encouraging results (Agrawala and Carraro 2010).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.73" top="243.13"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 243.13; y1: 252.63; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="243.13" x1="571.73" class="s1063">In summary, effective adaptation strategies can reduce the negative impacts of climate change.

Livestock in low and middle-income countries contribute 70% of the emissions from ruminants and 53% from monogastric livestock (animals without ruminant digestion processes such as pigs and poultry), and these are expected to increase as demand for livestock products increases in these countries (Figure 5.10). In contrast to the increasing trend in absolute GHG emissions, GHG emissions intensities, defined as GHG emissions per unit produced, have declined globally and are about 60% lower today than in the 1960s. This is largely due to improved meat and milk productivity of cattle breeds (FAOSTAT 2018; Davis et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.8" top="651.13"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 651.13; y1: 660.63; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="651.13" x1="571.8" class="s1063">Still, products like red meat remain the most inefficient in terms of emissions per kg of protein produced in comparison to milk, pork, eggs and all crop products (IPCC 2014b). Yet, the functional unit used in these measurements is highly relevant and may produce different results (Salou et al. 2017). For instance, metrics based on products tend to rate intensive livestock systems as efficient, while metrics based on area or resources used tend to rate extensive systems as efficient (Garnett 2011). In ruminant dairy systems, less intensified farms show higher emissions if expressed by product, and lower emissions if expressed by Utilizable Agricultural Land (Gutiérrez-Peña et al. 2019; Salvador et al. 2017; Salou et al. 2017). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.8" top="507.15"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.77; y0: 507.15; y1: 516.65; width: 4.05; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="507.15" x1="571.8" class="s1063">Furthermore, if other variables are used in the analysis of GHG emissions of different ruminant production systems, such as human-edible grains used to feed animals instead of crop waste and pastures of marginal lands, or carbon sequestration in pasture systems in degraded lands, then the GHG emissions of extensive systems are reduced. Reductions of 26% and 43% have been shown in small ruminants, such as sheep and goats (Gutiérrez-Peña et al. 2019; Salvador et al. 2017; Batalla et al. 2015 and Petersen et al. 2013). In this regard, depending on what the main challenge is in different regions (for example, undernourishment, over-consumption, natural resources degradation), different metrics could be used as reference. Other metrics that consider nutrient density have been proposed because they provide potential for addressing both mitigation and health targets (Doran-Browne et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.75" top="327.17"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.34; y0: 327.17; y1: 336.67; width: 5.62; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="327.17" x1="571.75" class="s1063">Uncertainty in worldwide livestock population numbers remains the main source of variation in total emissions of the livestock sector, while at the animal level, feed intake, diet regime, and nutritional composition are the main sources of variation through their impacts on enteric fermentation and manure N excretion. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.75" top="255.18"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 255.18; y1: 264.68; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="255.18" x1="571.75" class="s1063">Increases in economies of scale linked to increased efficiencies and decreased emission intensities may lead to more emissions, rather than less, an observed dynamic referred to by economists as a ‘rebound effect’. This is because increased efficiency allows production processes to be performed using fewer resources and often at lower cost. This in turn influences consumer behaviour and product use, increasing demand and leading to increased production. In this way, the expected gains from new technologies that increase the efficiency of resource use may be reduced (for example, increase in the total production of livestock despite increased efficiency of production due to increased demand for meat sold at lower prices). Thus, in order for the livestock sector to provide a contribution to GHG mitigation, reduction in emissions intensities need to be accompanied by appropriate governance and incentive mechanisms to avoid rebound effects, such as limits on total production.</span></div><div left="27.53" right="33.77" top="268.29"><span style="x0: 27.53; x1: 33.77; y0: 268.29; y1: 280.29; width: 6.24; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0];" x0="27.53" y0="268.29" x1="33.77" class="s1062">5</span></div><div left="59.53" right="153.17" top="735.11"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.63; y0: 735.11; y1: 744.61; width: 5.1; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="735.11" x1="153.17" class="s1063">Variation in estimates of N</span><span style="x0: 153.17; x1: 156.36; y0: 734.92; y1: 741.57; width: 3.19; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="153.17" y0="734.92" x1="156.36" class="s1098">2</span><span style="x0: 156.36; x1: 162.17; y0: 735.11; y1: 744.61; width: 5.81; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="156.36" y0="735.11" x1="307.58" class="s1063">O emissions are due to differing (i) climate regimes, (ii) soil types, and (iii) N transformation pathways (Charles et al. 2017 and Fitton et al. 2017).

Cookers, boilers, and furnaces emit carbon dioxide, and wastewater emits methane and nitrous oxide.

Godfray et al. (2018) updated Nelson et al. (2016), a previous systematic review of the literature on environmental impacts associated with food, and concluded that higher consumption of animal-based foods was associated with higher estimated environmental impacts, whereas increased consumption of plant-based foods was associated with estimated lower environmental impact. Assessment of individual foods within these broader categories showed that meat – sometimes specified as ruminant meat (mainly beef) – was consistently identified as the single food with the greatest impact on the environment, most often in terms of GHG emissions and/or land use per unit commodity. Similar hierarchies, linked to well-known energy losses along trophic chains, from roots to beef were found in another recent review focussing exclusively on GHG emissions (Clune et al. 2017), and one on life-cycle assessments (Poore and Nemecek 2018). Poore and Nemecek (2018) amassed an extensive database that specifies both the hierarchy of emissions intensities and the variance with the production context (for example, by country and farming system).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.26" top="447.14"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.41; y0: 447.14; y1: 456.64; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="65.2" y0="447.14" x1="313.26" class="s1063">The emissions intensities of red meat mean that its production has a disproportionate impact on total emissions (Godfray et al. 2018). For example, in the USA 4% of food sold (by weight) is beef, which accounts for 36% of food-related emissions (Heller and Keoleian 2015). Food-related emissions are therefore very sensitive to the amount and type of meat consumed. However, 100 g of beef has twice as much protein as the equivalent in cooked weight of beans, for example, and 2.5 times more iron.

Whilst sustainable diets need not necessarily provide more nutrition, there is certainly significant overlap between those that are healthier (e.g., via eating more plant-based material and less livestock-based material), and eating the appropriate level of calories. In their systematic review, Nelson et al. (2016) conclude that, in general, a dietary pattern that is higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in animal-based foods is more health-promoting and is associated with lesser environmental impact (GHG emissions and energy, land, and water use) than is the current average ‘meat-based’ diet.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="99.18"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 99.18; y1: 108.68; width: 4.93; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="65.2" y0="99.18" x1="313.23" class="s1063">Recent FAO projections of food and agriculture to 2050 under alternative scenarios characterised by different degrees of sustainability, provide global-scale evidence that rebalancing diets is key to increasing the overall sustainability of food and agricultural systems world-wide. A 15% reduction of animal products in the diets of high-income countries by 2050 would contribute to containing the need to expand agricultural output due to upward global demographic trends. Not only would GHG emissions and the pressure on land and water be significantly reduced but the potential for low-income countries to increase the intake of animal-based food, with beneficial nutritional outcomes, could be enhanced (FAO 2018a).

This chapter expands on these key findings to document how mitigation in the entire food system, from farm gate to consumer, can contribute to reaching the stated global mitigation goals, but in a context of improved food security and nutrition. To put the range of mitigation potential of food systems in context, it is worth noting that emissions from crop and livestock are expected to increase by 30–40% from present to 2050, under business-as-usual scenarios that include efficiency improvements as well as dietary changes linked to increased income per capita (FAO 2018a; Tubiello et al. 2014).

Key mitigation pathways are related to practices reducing nitrous oxide emissions from fertiliser applications, reducing methane emissions from paddy rice, reducing both gases through livestock manure management and applications, and sequestering carbon or reducing its losses, with practices for improving grassland and cropland management identified as the largest mitigation opportunities.

      <td>The effort towards sustainable intensification has also been\nincorporated in agricultural policies. In Brazil, for instance,\nthe reduction of deforestation, the restoration of degraded\npasture areas, the adoption of integrated agroforestry\nsystems3 and no-till agricultural techniques play a major\nrole in the nation’s voluntary commitments to reduce GHG\nemissions in the country’s NAMAs (Mozzer 2011) and\nNDCs (Silva Oliveira et al. 2017; Rochedo et al. 2018). Such\ncommitment under the UNFCCC is operationalised through\nthe Low Carbon Agriculture Plan (ABC),4 which is based on\nlow interest credit for investment in sustainable agricultural\ntechnologies (Mozzer 2011). Direct pasture restoration and\nintegrated systems reduce area requirements (Strassburg\net al. 2014), and increase organic matter (Gil et al. 2015;\nBungenstab 2012; Maia et al. 2009), contributing to overall\nlifecycle emissions reduction (Cardoso et al. 2016; de Oliveira\nSilva et al. 2016). Also, increased adoption of supplementation\nand feedlots, often based on agroindustrial co-products and\nagricultural crop residues are central to improve productivity\nand increase climate resilience of livestock systems (Mottet\net al. 2017a; van Zanten et al. 2018).</td>

More intensive systems, with strong market orientation, such as dairy in the US, can implement a range of sophisticated practices like feed additives and vaccines, while many market-oriented dairy systems in tropical regions can improve feed digestibility by improving forage quality and adding larger quantities of concentrate to the rations. Many of these strategies can be implemented as packages in different systems, thus maximising the synergies between different options (Mottet et al. 2017b).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="99.15"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 99.15; y1: 108.65; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="99.15" x1="566.07" class="s1063">See the Supplementary Material Section SM5.3 for a detailed description of livestock mitigation strategies; synergies and trade-offs with other mitigation and adaptation options are discussed in Section 5.6.</span></div><div left="595.24" right="601.48" top="268.29"><span style="x0: 595.24; x1: 601.48; y0: 268.29; y1: 280.29; width: 6.24; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0];" x0="595.24" y0="268.29" x1="601.48" class="s1062">5</span></div><div left="65.2" right="264.84" top="734.98"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.0; y0: 734.98; y1: 744.98; width: 4.8; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="65.2" y0="734.98" x1="264.84" class="s101">1.5.1.3 Greenhouse gas mitigation in agroforestry</span></div><div left="65.2" right="236.15" top="711.11"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 711.11; y1: 720.61; width: 5.45; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="65.2" y0="711.11" x1="236.15" class="s1063">Agroforestry can curb GHG emissions of CO</span><span style="x0: 236.11; x1: 239.3; y0: 710.92; y1: 717.57; width: 3.19; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="236.11" y0="710.92" x1="239.3" class="s1098">2</span><span style="x0: 239.27; x1: 241.55; y0: 711.11; y1: 720.61; width: 2.28; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="239.27" y0="711.11" x1="256.55" class="s1063">, CH</span><span style="x0: 256.5; x1: 259.69; y0: 710.92; y1: 717.57; width: 3.19; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="256.5" y0="710.92" x1="259.69" class="s1098">4</span><span style="x0: 259.66; x1: 261.94; y0: 711.11; y1: 720.61; width: 2.28; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="259.66" y0="711.11" x1="290.55" class="s1063">, and N</span><span style="x0: 290.5; x1: 293.69; y0: 710.92; y1: 717.57; width: 3.19; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="290.5" y0="710.92" x1="293.69" class="s1098">2</span><span style="x0: 293.66; x1: 299.47; y0: 711.11; y1: 720.61; width: 5.81; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="293.66" y0="711.11" x1="313.24" class="s1063">O in agricultural systems in both developed and developing countries (see Glossary for definition) (see Chapter 2, Section 2.5.1 and Figure 2.24).

The technical potential of this novel practice could replace 10–19% of the feed protein required, and would reduce cropland demand and associated emissions by 6–7%. These practices are, however, not economically feasible nor easily upscalable in most systems. Nonetheless, significant progress in Japan and South Korea in the reduction and use of food waste to increase efficiencies in livestock food chains has been achieved, indicating a possible pathway to progress elsewhere (FAO 2017; zu Ermgassen et al. 2016). Better understanding of biomass and food and feed wastes, value chains, and identification of mechanisms for reducing the transport and processing costs of these materials is required to facilitate larger-scale implementation.</span></div><div left="323.72" right="433.99" top="507.14"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 331.63; y0: 507.14; y1: 516.64; width: 7.91; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="507.14" x1="433.99" class="s1116">Waste streams into energy. </span><span style="x0: 433.98; x1: 441.54; y0: 507.14; y1: 516.64; width: 7.56; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="433.98" y0="507.14" x1="571.76" class="s1063">Waste streams from manure and food waste can be used for energy generation and thus reduction in overall GHG emissions in terms of recovered methane (for instance through anaerobic digestion) production (De Clercq et al. 2016) or for the production of microbial protein (Pikaar et al. 2018). Second-generation biorefineries, once the underlying technology is improved, may enable the generation of hydro-carbon from agricultural residues, grass, and woody biomass in ways that do not compete with food and can generate, along with biofuel, high-value products such as plastics (Nguyen et al. 2017). Second-generation energy biomass from residues may constitute a complementary income source for farmers that can increase their incentive to produce. Technologies include CHP (combined heat and power) or gas turbines, and fuel types such as biodiesel, biopyrolysis (i.e., high temperature chemical transformation of organic material in the absence of oxygen), torrefaction of biomass, production of cellulosic bioethanol and of bioalcohols produced by other means than fermentation, and the production of methane by anaerobic fermentation.

Cultured meat (CM) is part of so-called cellular agriculture, which includes production of milk, egg white and leather from industrial cell cultivation (Stephens et al. 2018). CM is produced from muscle cells extracted from living animals, isolation of adult skeletal muscle stem cells (myosatellite cells), placement in a culture medium which allow their differentiation into myoblasts and then, through another medium, generation of myocytes which coalesce into myotubes and grow into strands in a stirred-tank bioreactor (Mattick et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.76" top="567.13"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 328.82; y0: 567.13; y1: 576.63; width: 5.1; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="567.13" x1="571.76" class="s1063">Current technology enables the creation of beef hamburgers, nuggets, steak chips or similar products from meat of other animals, including wild species, although production currently is far from being economically feasible.

In this context it will face the competition of imitation meat (meat analogues from vegetal protein) and insect-derived products, which have been evaluated as more environmentally friendly (Alexander et al. 2017) and it may be considered as being an option for a limited resource world, rather than a mainstream solution. Besides, as the commercial production process is still largely undefined, its actual contribution to climate change mitigation and food security is largely uncertain and challenges are not negligible. Finally, it is important to understand the systemic nature of these challenges and evaluate their social impacts on rural populations due to transforming animal agriculture into an industrialised activity and its possible rebound effects on food security, which are still understudied in the literature.</span></div><div left="27.53" right="33.77" top="268.29"><span style="x0: 27.53; x1: 33.77; y0: 268.29; y1: 280.29; width: 6.24; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0];" x0="27.53" y0="268.29" x1="33.77" class="s1062">5</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.55" top="735.11"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 735.11; y1: 744.61; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="735.11" x1="307.55" class="s1063">Studies are needed to improve quantification of mitigation options for supply chain activities. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="236.89" top="686.98"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.73; y0: 686.98; y1: 696.98; width: 5.2; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="59.53" y0="686.98" x1="236.89" class="s10">1.5.2 Demand-side mitigation options </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.54" top="663.11"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 663.11; y1: 672.61; width: 5.45; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="663.11" x1="307.54" class="s1063">Although population growth is one of the drivers of global food demand and the resulting environmental burden, demand-side management of the food system could be one of the solutions to curb climate change.

However, analysing ruminant meat production is highly complex because of the extreme heterogeneity of production systems and due to the numerous products and services associated with ruminants (Gerber et al. 2015). See Supplementary Material Section SM5.3 for further discussion of uncertainties in estimates of livestock mitigation technical potential. Further, current market mechanisms are regarded as insufficient to decrease consumption or increase efficiency, and governmental intervention is often suggested to encourage mitigation in both the supply-side and demand-side of the food system (Section 5.7) (Wirsenius et al. 2011; Henderson et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="471.13"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 331.11; y0: 471.13; y1: 480.63; width: 7.39; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="471.13" x1="571.77" class="s1063">Minimising GHG emissions through mathematical programming with near-minimal acceptability constraints can be understood as a reference or technical potential for mitigation through diet shifts.

The remaining mass provide inputs to multiple industries, for example clothing, furniture, vehicle coating materials, biofuel, gelatine, soap, cosmetics, chemical and pharmaceutical industrial supplies, pet feed ingredients and fertilisers (Marti et al. 2011; Mogensen et al. 2016; Sousa et al. 2017).

Therefore, appropriate options for the prevention and management of food waste can be deployed to reduce food loss and waste and to minimise its environmental consequences. Papargyropoulou et al. (2014) proposed the Three Rs (i.e., reduction, recovery and recycle) options to prevent and manage food loss and waste. A wide range of approaches across the food supply chain is available to reduce food loss and waste, consisting of technical and non-technical solutions (Lipinski et al. 2013). However, technical solutions (e.g., improved harvesting techniques, on-farm storage, infrastructure, packaging to keep food fresher for longer, etc.) include additional costs (Rosegrant et al. 2015) and may have impacts on local environments (FAO 2018b). Additionally, all parts of food supply chains need to become efficient to achieve the full reduction potential of food loss and waste (Lipinski et al. 2013). </span></div><div left="318.04" right="566.09" top="267.14"><span style="x0: 318.04; x1: 322.26; y0: 267.14; y1: 276.64; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.04" y0="267.14" x1="566.09" class="s1063">Together with technical solutions, approaches (i.e., non-technical solutions) to changes in behaviours and attitudes of a wide range of stakeholders across the food system will play an important role in reducing food loss and waste. Food loss and waste can be recovered by distributing food surplus to groups affected by food poverty or converting food waste to animal feed (Vandermeersch et al. 2014). Unavoidable food waste can also be recycled to produce energy based on biological, thermal and thermochemical technologies (Pham et al. 2015).

For example, Michalský and Hooda (2015), through a quantitative assessment of GHG emissions of selected fruits and vegetables in the UK, reported that increased local production offers considerable emissions savings. They also highlighted that when imports are necessary, importing from Europe instead of the Global South can contribute to considerable GHG emissions savings. Similar results were found by Audsley et al. (2010), with exceptions for some foods, such as tomatoes, peppers or sheep and goat meat. Similarly, a study in India shows that long and fragmented supply chains, which lead to disrupted price signals, unequal power relations perverse incentives and long transport time, could be a key barrier to reducing post-harvest losses (CIPHET 2007).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.55" top="411.13"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 411.13; y1: 420.63; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="411.13" x1="307.55" class="s1063">In other cases, environmental benefits associated with local food can be offset by inefficient production systems with high emission intensity and resource needs, such as water, due to local conditions. For example, vegetables produced in open fields can have much lower GHG emissions than locally produced vegetables from heated greenhouses (Theurl et al. 2014). Whether locally grown food has a lower carbon footprint depends on the on-farm emissions intensity as well as the transport emissions. In some cases, imported food may have a lower carbon footprint than locally grown food because some distant countries can produce food at much lower emissions intensity. For example, Avetisyan et al. (2014) reported that regional variation of emission intensities associated with production of ruminant products have large implications for emissions associated with local food. They showed that consumption of local livestock products can reduce emissions due to short supply chains in countries with low emission intensities; however, this might not be the case in countries with high emission intensities. </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.58" top="195.16"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 61.83; y0: 195.16; y1: 204.66; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="195.16" x1="307.58" class="s1063">In addition to improving emission intensity, efficient distribution systems for local food are needed for lowering carbon footprints (Newman et al. 2013). Emissions associated with food transport depend on the mode of transport, for example, emissions are lower for rail rather than truck (Brodt et al. 2013). Tobarra et al. (2018) reported that emissions saving from local food may vary across seasons and regions of import. They highlighted that, in Spain, local production of fruits and vegetables can reduce emissions associated with imports from Africa but imports from France and Portugal can save emissions in comparison to production in Spain. Additionally, local production of seasonal products in Spain reduces emissions, while imports of out-of-season products can save emissions rather than producing them locally. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.11" top="699.18"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 699.18; y1: 708.68; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="699.18" x1="566.11" class="s1063">In summary, consuming locally grown foods can reduce GHG emissions, if they are grown efficiently (</span><span style="x0: 481.05; x1: 485.63; y0: 687.18; y1: 696.68; width: 4.58; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="481.05" y0="687.18" x1="541.45" class="s1068">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 541.45; x1: 544.09; y0: 687.18; y1: 696.68; width: 2.64; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="541.45" y0="687.18" x1="566.12" class="s1063">). The emissions reduction potential varies by region and season.

Among the available NETs, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies are receiving increasing attention. Land-based CDRs include afforestation and reforestation (AR), sustainable forest management, biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and biochar (BC) production (Minx et al. 2018). Most of the literature on global land-based mitigation potential relies on CDRs, particularly on BECCS, as a major mitigation action (Kraxner et al. 2014; Larkin et al. 2018 and Rogelj et al. 2018, 2015, 2011). BECCS is not yet deployable at a significant scale, as it faces challenges similar to fossil fuel carbon capture and storage (CCS) (Fuss et al. 2016; Vaughan and Gough 2016; Nemet et al. 2018). Regardless, the effectiveness of large-scale BECCS to meet Paris Agreement goals has been questioned and other pathways to mitigation have been proposed (Anderson and Peters 2016; van Vuuren et al. 2017, 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; Vaughan and Gough 2016). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="384.57" top="699.13"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 329.17; y0: 699.13; y1: 708.63; width: 5.45; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="699.13" x1="384.57" class="s1063">Atmospheric CO</span><span style="x0: 384.56; x1: 387.75; y0: 698.92; y1: 705.57; width: 3.19; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="384.56" y0="698.92" x1="387.75" class="s1098">2</span><span style="x0: 392.49; x1: 395.3; y0: 699.11; y1: 708.61; width: 2.81; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="392.49" y0="699.11" x1="571.77" class="s1063">removal by storage in vegetation depends on achieving net organic carbon accumulation in plant biomass over decadal time scales (Kemper 2015) and, after plant tissue decay, in soil organic matter (Del Grosso et al. 2019).

In addition, CDR effectiveness varies widely depending on type of biomass, crop productivity, and emissions offset in the energy system.

Latin America and Africa, for instance, although having high biomass production potential, still have low domestic energy consumption (589 and 673 MTOE – 24.7 and 28.2 EJ, respectively), with about 30% of primary energy from renewable sources (reaching 50% in Brazil), mainly hydropower and traditional biomass. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="350.05" top="267.17"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.27; y0: 267.17; y1: 276.67; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="267.17" x1="350.05" class="s1063">There is </span><span style="x0: 352.18; x1: 356.75; y0: 267.17; y1: 276.67; width: 4.58; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="352.18" y0="267.17" x1="413.58" class="s1068">high confidence </span><span style="x0: 415.7; x1: 418.51; y0: 267.17; y1: 276.67; width: 2.81; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="415.7" y0="267.17" x1="566.1" class="s1063">that deployment of BECCS will require ambitious investments and policy interventions (Peters and Geden 2017) with strong regulation and governance of bioenergy production to ensure protection of forests, maintain food security and enhance climate benefits (Burns and Nicholson 2017; Vaughan et al. 2018; Muratori et al. 2016), and that such conditions may be challenging for developing countries.

Earlier studies (e.g., Nelson et al. 2009) showed that recent climate impacts that reduced crop productivity led to higher prices and increased trade of commodities between regions, with asymmetric impacts on producers and consumers. In terms of published scenario analyses, the most affected regions tend to be Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, but there is significant heterogeneity in results between countries. Relocation of production to less affected areas buffers these impacts to a certain extent, and offers potential for improvements in food production technologies (Hasegawa et al. 2018; van Meijl et al. 2017; Wiebe et al. 2015; Lotze-Campen et al. 2014; Valin et al. 2014; Robinson et al. 2014).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.24" top="279.12"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 279.12; y1: 288.62; width: 5.45; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="65.2" y0="279.12" x1="313.24" class="s1063">A newer, less studied impact of climate change on prices and their impacts on food security is the level of land-based mitigation necessary to stabilise global temperature. Hasegawa et al. (2018), using an ensemble of seven global economic models across a range of GHG emissions pathways and socioeconomic trajectories, suggested that the level of mitigation effort needed to reduce emissions can have a more significant impact on prices than the climate impacts themselves on reduced crop yields (Figure 5.14). This occurs because in the models, taxing GHG emissions leads to higher crop and livestock prices, while land-based mitigation leads to less land availability for food production, potentially lower food supply, and therefore food price increases. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.25" top="123.14"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.77; y0: 123.14; y1: 132.64; width: 4.57; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="65.2" y0="123.14" x1="313.25" class="s1063">Price increases in turn lead to reduced consumption, especially by vulnerable groups, or to shifts towards cheaper food, which are often less nutritious. This leads to significant increases in the number of malnourished people. Frank et al. (2017) and Fujimori et al. (2017) arrived at the same conclusions for the 1.5°C mitigation scenario using the IAM Globiom and ensembles of AgMIP global economic models. While the magnitude of the response differs between models, the results are consistent between them. In contrast, a study based on five global agroeconomic models highlights that the global food prices may not increase much when the required land for bioenergy is accessible on the margin of current cropland, or the feedstock does not have a direct completion with agricultural land (Lotze-Campen et al. 2014). </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.75" top="639.17"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 327.94; y0: 639.17; y1: 648.67; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="639.17" x1="571.75" class="s1063">These studies highlight the need for careful design of emissions mitigation policies in upcoming decades – for example, targeted schemes encouraging more productive and resilient agricultural production systems and the importance of incorporating complementary policies (such as safety-net programmes for poverty alleviation) that compensate or counteract the impacts of climate change mitigation policies on vulnerable regions (Hasegawa et al. 2018). Fujimori et al. (2018) showed how an inclusive policy design can avoid adverse side effects on food security through international aid, bioenergy taxes, or domestic reallocation of income. These strategies can shield impoverished and vulnerable people from the additional risk of hunger that would be caused by the economic effects of policies narrowly focussing on climate objectives only. </span></div><div left="323.72" right="571.77" top="471.19"><span style="x0: 323.72; x1: 326.02; y0: 471.19; y1: 480.69; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="323.72" y0="471.19" x1="571.77" class="s1063">In summary, food security will be threatened through increasing numbers of malnourished people if land-based mitigation raises prices, unless other policy mechanisms reduce its impact (</span><span style="x0: 553.64; x1: 558.22; y0: 447.19; y1: 456.69; width: 4.58; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="553.64" y0="447.19" x1="571.76" class="s1068">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 362.6; x1: 365.24; y0: 435.19; y1: 444.69; width: 2.64; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="362.6" y0="435.19" x1="571.79" class="s1063">).

Changing diets can also reduce non-dietary related health issues caused by emissions of air pollutants. For example, specific changes in diets were assessed for their potential to mitigate PM 2.5 in China (Zhao et al. 2017b).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="567.12"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 63.75; y0: 567.12; y1: 576.62; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="567.12" x1="307.6" class="s1063">Some studies are starting to estimate both health and environmental benefits from dietary shifts.

They seek to promote ecological processes and services such as nutrient cycling, balanced predator/prey interactions, competition, symbiosis, and successional changes. The overall goal is to benefit human and non-human communities in the ecological sphere, with fewer negative environmental or social impacts and fewer external inputs (Vandermeer et al. 1998; Altieri et al. 1998).

Such systems can help diversify production and/or incomes and support efficient and timely use of inputs, thus contributing to increased resilience, but they require local seed and input systems and extension services. Recent whole farm modelling exercises have shown the economic and environmental (reduced GH emissions, reduced land use) benefits of integrated crop-livestock systems (Gil et al. 2018) compared different soy-livestock systems across multiple economic and environmental indicators, including climate resilience.

Sustainable soil management practices can address both food security and climate change challenges faced by these agricultural systems.

Thus, a careful analysis of the production system is necessary to minimise the trade-offs among the multiple use of residues, especially where residues remain an integral part of livestock feeding (Sapkota et al. 2017b). Similarly, replacing mono-cropping systems with more diversified cropping systems and agroforestry, as well as afforestation and deforestation, can buffer temperatures as well as increase carbon storage (Mbow et al. 2014a; Bioversity International 2016), and provide diversified and healthy diets in the face of climate change. </span></div><div left="65.2" right="313.23" top="255.13"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 255.13; y1: 264.63; width: 5.45; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="65.2" y0="255.13" x1="313.23" class="s1063">Adoption of conservation agriculture in Africa has been low despite more than three decades of implementation (Giller et al. 2009),although there is promising uptake recently in east and southern Africa.

SI in intensively farmed areas may require a reduction in production in favour of increasing sustainability in the broad sense (Buckwell et al. 2014) (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 5). Hence, moving towards sustainability may imply lower yield growth rates than those maximally attainable in such situations. For areas that contain valuable natural ecosystems, such as the primary forest in the Congo basin, intensification of agriculture is one of the pillars of the strategy to conserve forest (Vanlauwe et al. 2014). Intensification in agriculture is recognised as one of the pathways to meet food security and climate change adaptation and mitigation goals (Sapkota et al. 2017c). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.6" top="231.13"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 231.13; y1: 240.63; width: 5.45; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="231.13" x1="307.6" class="s1063">However, SI does not always confer co-benefits in terms of food security and climate change adaption/mitigation. For example, in the case of Vietnam, intensified production of rice and pigs reduced GHG emissions in the short term through land sparing, but after two decades, the emissions associated with higher inputs were likely to outweigh the savings from land sparing (Thu Thuy et al. 2009). Intensification needs to be sustainable in all components of food system by curbing agricultural sprawl, rebuilding soils, restoring degraded lands, reducing agricultural pollution, increasing water use efficiency, and decreasing the use of external inputs (Cook et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.57" top="99.15"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.98; y0: 99.15; y1: 108.65; width: 5.45; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="99.15" x1="307.57" class="s1063">A study conducted by Palm et al.

Land-use intensity may be defined in terms of three components; (i) intensity of system inputs (land/soil, capital, labour, knowledge, nutrients and other chemicals), (ii) intensity of system outputs (yield per unit land area or per specific input) and (iii) the impacts of land use on ecosystem services such as changes in soil carbon or biodiversity (Erb et al. 2013). Intensified land use can lead to ecological damage as well as degradation of soil, resulting in a loss of function which underpins many ecosystem services (Wilhelm and Smith 2018; Smith et al. 2016). Therefore, there is a risk that increased agricultural intensification could deliver short-term production goals at the expense of future productive potential, jeopardising long term food security (Tilman et al. 2011). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="299.09" top="387.15"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.82; y0: 387.15; y1: 396.65; width: 5.45; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="79.37" y0="387.15" x1="299.09" class="s1063">Agroecosystems which maintain or improve the natural and human capital and services they provide may be defined as sustainable systems, while those which deplete these assets as unsustainable (Pretty and Bharucha 2014). Producing more food, fuel and fibre without the conversion of additional non-agricultural land while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts requires what has been termed sustainable intensification (Godfray et al. 2010; FAO 2011e) (Glossary and Figure 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box). Sustainable intensification (SI) may be achieved through a wide variety of means; from improved nutrient and water use efficiency via plant and animal breeding programmes, to the implementation of integrated soil fertility and pest management practices, as well as by smarter land-use allocation at a larger spatial scale: for example, matching land use to the context and specific capabilities of the land (Benton et al. 2018). However, implementation of SI is broader than simply increasing the technical efficiency of agriculture (‘doing more with less’). It sometimes may require a reduction of yields to raise sustainability, and successful implementation can be dependent on place and scale. Pretty et al. (2018), following Hill (1985), highlights three elements to SI: (i) increasing efficiency, (ii) substitution of less beneficial or efficient practices for better ones, and (iii) system redesign to adopt new practices and farming systems (Table 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box). </span></div><div left="79.37" right="299.1" top="63.19"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 84.99; y0: 63.19; y1: 72.69; width: 5.62; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="79.37" y0="63.19" x1="299.1" class="s1063">Under a land sparing strategy, intensification of land use in some areas, generating higher productivity per unit area of land, can allow other land to provide other ecosystem services, such as increased carbon sequestration and the conservation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity (Balmford et al. 2018 and Strassburg et al. 2014). Conversely under a land sharing strategy, less, or no, land is set aside, but lower levels of intensification are applied to agricultural land, providing a combination of provisioning and other functions such as biodiversity conservation from the same land (Green et al. 2005). The two approaches are not mutually exclusive and the suitability of their application is generally system-, scale- and/or location-specific (Fischer et al. 2014). One crucial issue for the success of a land sparing strategy is that spared land is protected from further conversion. As the profits from the intensively managed land increase, there is an incentive for conversion of additional land for production (Byerlee et al. 2014). Furthermore, it is implicit that there are limits to the SI of land at a local and also planetary boundary level (Rockström et al. 2009). These may relate to the ‘health’ of soil, the presence of supporting services, such as pollination, local limits to water availability, or limits on air quality. This implies that it may not be possible to meet demand ‘sustainably’ if demand exceeds local and global limits. There are no single global solutions to these challenges and specific in situ responses for different farming systems and locations are required. Bajželj et al. (2014) showed that implementation of SI, primarily through yield gap closure, had better environmental outcomes compared with ‘business as usual’ trajectories. However, SI alone will not be able to deliver the necessary environmental outcomes from the food system – dietary change and reduced food waste are also required (Springmann et al. 2018a; Bajželj et al. 2014). </span></div><div><table border="1" class="dataframe">

      <td>Agroecosystems which maintain or improve the natural\nand human capital and services they provide may be\ndefined as sustainable systems, while those which deplete\nthese assets as unsustainable (Pretty and Bharucha 2014).\nProducing more food, fuel and fibre without the conversion\nof additional non-agricultural land while simultaneously\nreducing environmental impacts requires what has been\ntermed sustainable intensification (Godfray et al. 2010; FAO\n2011e) (Glossary and Figure 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box).\nSustainable intensification (SI) may be achieved through\na wide variety of means; from improved nutrient and water\nuse efficiency via plant and animal breeding programmes,\nto the implementation of integrated soil fertility and pest\nmanagement practices, as well as by smarter land-use\nallocation at a larger spatial scale: for example, matching\nland use to the context and specific capabilities of the\nland (Benton et al. 2018). However, implementation of SI\nis broader than simply increasing the technical efficiency\nof agriculture (‘doing more with less’). It sometimes may\nrequire a reduction of yields to raise sustainability, and\nsuccessful implementation can be dependent on place and\nscale. Pretty et al. (2018), following Hill (1985), highlights\nthree elements to SI: (i) increasing efficiency, (ii) substitution\nof less beneficial or efficient practices for better ones, and (iii)\nsystem redesign to adopt new practices and farming systems\n(Table 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box).</td>

Grey bars show insufficient data for analysis; white box shows number of data pairs used in analysis. The correlation between unique pairs of indicator time-series is carried based on country data. For example, between ‘prevalence of undernourishment’ (an indicator for SDG 2.1) and ‘maternal mortality ratio’ (an indicator for SDG 3.1). The data pairs can belong to the same goal or to two distinct goals. At the global level, intra-linkages of SDGs are quantified by the percentage of synergies, trade-offs, and nonclassifieds of indicator pairs belonging to the same SDG for all the countries. Similarly, SDG interlinkages are estimated by the percentage of synergies, trade-offs, and nonclassifieds between indicator pairs that fall into two distinct goals for all the countries.</span></div><div><table border="1" class="dataframe">

Precise monitoring of crop performance over the course of the growing season will enable farmers to economise on their inputs in terms of water, nutrients and pest management. Therefore, it can contribute to both the food security (by maintaining yields), sustainability (by reducing unnecessary inputs) and land sparing goals associated with SI. The site-specific management of weeds allows a more efficient application of herbicide to specific weed patches within crops (Jensen et al. 2012). Such precision weed control has resulted in herbicide savings of 19–22% for winter oilseed rape, 46–57% for sugar beet and 60–77% for winter wheat production (Gutjahr and Gerhards 2010). The use of on-farm sensors for real time management of crop and livestock performance can enhance farm efficiency (Aqeel-Ur-Rehman et al. 2014). Mapping soil nutrition status can allow for more targeted, and therefore more effective, nutrient management practices (Hedley 2015). Using wireless sensors to monitor environmental conditions, such as soil moisture, has the potential to allow more efficient crop irrigation (Srbinovska et al. 2015). Controlled traffic farming, where farm machinery is confined to permanent tracks, using automatic steering and satellite guidance, increases yields by minimising soil compaction. However, barriers to the uptake of many of these high-tech precision agriculture technologies remain. In what is described as the ‘implementation problem’, despite the potential to collect vast quantities of data on crop or livestock performance, applying these data to inform management decisions remains a challenge (Lindblom et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="79.37" right="202.58" top="183.17"><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 183.17; y1: 192.67; width: 4.22; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="79.37" y0="183.17" x1="202.58" class="s1116">Low-tech precision agriculture </span><span style="x0: 79.37; x1: 83.59; y0: 171.17; y1: 180.67; width: 4.22; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="79.37" y0="171.17" x1="299.07" class="s1063">The principle of precision agriculture can be applied equally to low capital-input farming, in the form of low-tech precision agriculture (Conway 2013).

This type of precision agriculture is particularly relevant to small-scale farming in the Global South, where capital investment is major limiting factor. For example, the application of a simple seed priming technique resulted in a 20 to 30% increase in yields of pearl millet and sorghum in semi-arid West Africa (Aune et al. 2017).

For example, in temperate regions, highly productive agricultural grasslands used to produce meat and dairy products are characterised by monoculture pastures with high agrochemical inputs. Multi-species grasslands may provide a route to SI, as even a modest increase in species richness in intensively managed grasslands can result in higher forage yields without increased inputs, such as chemical fertiliser (Finn et al. 2013; Sanderson et al. 2013; Tilman et al. 2011).

With\nrespect to SI, a landscape approach is pertinent to achieving\npotential benefits for biodiversity conservation, ensuring that\nland ‘spared’ through SI remains protected, and that adverse\nimpacts of agriculture on conservation land are minimised.\nDepending on the land governance mechanisms applied in\nthe jurisdiction, different approaches will be appropriate/\nrequired. However, benefits are only assured if land-use\nrestrictions are devised and enforced.</td>

Improving the efficiency\nof agriculture systems can increase production per unit of\nland through more effective resource use. To achieve SI,\nsome intensively managed agricultural systems may have to\nbe diversified as they cannot be further intensified without\nland degradation. A combination of land sparing and sharing\noptions can be utilised to achieve SI – their application is\nmost likely to succeed if applied using a landscape approach.</td>

These are being developed by big and medium-sized cities in the world, often integrated within climate change policies (Moragues et al. 2013 and Calori and Magarini 2015). A review of 100 cities shows that urban food consumption is one of the largest sources of urban material flows, urban carbon footprint, and land footprint (Goldstein et al. 2017). Additionally, the urban poor have limited capacity to adapt to climate-related impacts, which place their food security at risk under climate change (Dubbeling and de Zeeuw 2011).</span></div><div left="59.53" right="175.75" top="531.13"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 65.33; y0: 531.13; y1: 540.63; width: 5.8; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="531.13" x1="175.75" class="s1116">Urban and peri-urban areas. </span><span style="x0: 176.56; x1: 178.86; y0: 531.13; y1: 540.63; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="176.56" y0="531.13" x1="307.94" class="s1063">In 2010, around 14% of the global population was nourished by food grown in urban and peri-urban areas (Kriewald et al. 2019). A review study on Sub-Saharan Africa shows that urban and peri-urban agriculture contributes to climate change adaptation and mitigation (Lwasa et al. 2014, 2015). Urban and peri-urban agriculture reduces the food carbon footprint by avoiding long distance food transport. These types of agriculture also limit GHG emissions by recycling organic waste and wastewater that would otherwise release methane from landfills and dumping sites (Lwasa et al. 2014). Urban and peri-urban agriculture also contribute in adapting to climate change, including extreme events, by reducing the urban heat island effect, increasing water infiltration and slowing down run-offs to prevent flooding, etc. (Lwasa et al. 2014, 2015; Kumar et al. 2017a). For example, a scenario analysis shows that urban gardens reduce the surface temperature up to 10°C in comparison to the temperature without vegetation (Tsilini et al. 2015). Urban agriculture can also improve biodiversity and strengthen associated ecosystem services (Lin et al. 2015). </span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.96" top="303.16"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 65.15; y0: 303.16; y1: 312.66; width: 5.62; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="303.16" x1="307.96" class="s1063">Urban and peri-urban agriculture is exposed to climate risks and urban growth that may undermine its long-term potential to address urban food security (Padgham et al. 2015). Therefore, there is a need to better understand the impact of urban sprawl on peri-urban agriculture; the contribution of urban and peri-urban agriculture to food self-sufficiency of cities; the risks posed by pollutants from urban areas to agriculture and vice-versa; the global and regional extent of urban agriculture; and the role that urban agriculture could play in climate resilience and abating malnutrition (Mok et al. 2014; Hamilton et al. 2014). Globally, urban sprawl is projected to consume 1.8–2.4% and 5% of the current cultivated land by 2030 and 2050 respectively, leading to crop calorie loss of 3–4% and 6–7%, respectively (Pradhan et al. 2014 and Bren d’Amour et al. 2017). Kriewald et al. 2019 shows that the urban growth has the largest impact in many sub-continental regions (e.g., Western, Central, and Eastern Africa), while climate change will mostly reduce potential of urban and peri-urban agriculture in Southern Europe and North Africa.</span></div><div left="317.67" right="566.12" top="735.18"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 319.97; y0: 735.18; y1: 744.68; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="317.67" y0="735.18" x1="566.12" class="s1063">In summary, urban and peri-urban agriculture can contribute to improving urban food security, reducing GHG emissions, and adapting to climate change impacts </span><span style="x0: 414.38; x1: 417.02; y0: 711.18; y1: 720.68; width: 2.64; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="414.38" y0="711.18" x1="552.76" class="s1068">(robust evidence, medium agreement).</span></div><div left="317.67" right="544.86" top="674.98"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 322.87; y0: 674.98; y1: 684.98; width: 5.2; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="317.67" y0="674.98" x1="544.86" class="s10">1.6.6 Links to the Sustainable Development Goals </span></div><div left="317.67" right="566.09" top="651.11"><span style="x0: 317.67; x1: 319.97; y0: 651.11; y1: 660.61; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="317.67" y0="651.11" x1="566.09" class="s1063">In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement were two global major international policies adopted by all countries to guide the world to overall sustainability, within the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and UNFCCC processes respectively.

Sustainable transformation of traditional consumption and production approaches can overcome these trade-offs based on several innovative methods (Shove et al. 2012).

The extensification option could lead to increases rather than decreases in GHG emissions related to reduction in beef consumption.

Miles et al. (2017) stated that a research and policy feedback that allows transitions to sustainable food systems must take a whole system approach. Currently, in transmitting knowledge for food security and land sustainability under climate change there are three major approaches: (i) public technology transfer with demonstration (extension agents); (ii) public and private advisory services (for intensification techniques) and; (iii) non-formal education with many different variants such as farmer field schools, rural resource centres; facilitation extension where front-line agents primarily work as ‘knowledge brokers’ in facilitating the teaching-learning process among all types of farmers (including women and rural young people), or farmer-to-farmer, where farmers act themselves as knowledge transfer and sharing actors through peer processes.</span></div><div left="318.05" right="480.31" top="506.98"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 506.98; y1: 516.98; width: 4.8; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="318.05" y0="506.98" x1="480.31" class="s101">1.7.4.1 Indigenous and local knowledge</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="483.11"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.98; y0: 483.11; y1: 492.61; width: 4.93; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="483.11" x1="566.09" class="s1063">Recent discourse has a strong orientation towards scaling-up innovation and adoption by local farmers. However, autonomous adaptation, indigenous knowledge and local knowledge are both important for agricultural adaptation (Biggs et al. 2013) (Section 5.3). These involve the promotion of farmer participation in governance structures, research, and the design of systems for the generation and dissemination of knowledge and technology, so that farmers’ needs and knowledge can be taken into consideration. Klenk et al. (2017) found that mobilisation of local knowledge can inform adaptation decision-making and may facilitate greater flexibility in government-funded research. As an example, rural innovation in terrace agriculture developed on the basis of a local coping mechanism and adopted by peasant farmers in Latin America may serve as an adaptation option or starting place for learning about climate change responses (Bocco and Napoletano 2017). Clemens et al. (2015) found that an open dialogue platform enabled horizontal exchange of ideas and alliances for social learning and knowledge-sharing in Vietnam. Improving local technologies in a participatory manner, through on-farm experimentation, farmer-to-farmer exchange, consideration of women and youths, is also relevant in mobilising knowledge and technologies. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="413.46" top="230.98"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.85; y0: 230.98; y1: 240.98; width: 4.8; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="318.05" y0="230.98" x1="413.46" class="s101">1.7.4.2 Citizen science</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.12" top="207.11"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 323.15; y0: 207.11; y1: 216.61; width: 5.1; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="207.11" x1="566.12" class="s1063">Citizen science has been tested as a useful tool with potential for biodiversity conservation (Schmitz et al. 2015) and mobilising knowledge from society.

Education refers to early learning and lifelong acquisition of skills for higher awareness and actions for solving food system challenges (FAO 2005). Education also entails vocational training, research and institutional strengthening (Hollinger 2015). Educational focus changes according to the supply side (e.g., crop selection, input resource management, yield improvement, and diversification) and the demand since (nutrition and dietary health implications).

Research and education need to be coordinated so that knowledge gaps can be filled and greater trust established in shifting behaviour of individuals to be more sustainable. Education campaigns can also influence policy and legislation, and help to advance successful outcomes for climate change mitigation and adaptation regarding supply-side innovations, technologies, trade, and investment, and demand-side evolution of food choices for health and sustainability, and greater gender equality throughout the entire food system (Heller 2019).</span></div><div left="93.15" right="115.34" top="515.08"><span style="x0: 93.15;

Given the potential for shocks driven by changing patterns of extreme weather to increase with climate change, there is the potential for market volatility to disrupt food supply through creating food price spikes. This potential is exacerbated by the interconnectedness of the food system (Puma et al. 2015) with other sectors (i.e., the food system depends on water, energy, and transport) (Homer-Dixon et al. 2015), so the impact of shocks can propagate across sectors and geographies (Homer-Dixon et al. 2015). There is also less spare land globally than there has been in the past, such that if prices spike, there are fewer options to bring new production on stream (Marianela et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.09" top="375.13"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 320.35; y0: 375.13; y1: 384.63; width: 2.3; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="375.13" x1="566.09" class="s1063">Increasing extreme weather events can disrupt production and transport logistics. For example, in 2012 the USA Corn Belt suffered a widespread drought; USA corn yield declined 16% compared to 2011 and 25% compared to 2009. In 2016, a record yield loss in France that is attributed to a conjunction of abnormal warmness in late autumn and abnormal wet in the following spring (Ben-Ari et al. 2018) is another well-documented example. To the extent that such supply shocks are associated with climate change, they may become more frequent and contribute to greater instability in agricultural markets in the future. </span></div><div left="318.05" right="566.07" top="243.15"><span style="x0: 318.05; x1: 322.09; y0: 243.15; y1: 252.65; width: 4.05; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="318.05" y0="243.15" x1="566.07" class="s1063">Furthermore, analogue conditions of past extremes might create significantly greater impacts in a warmer world. A study simulating analogous conditions to the Dust Bowl drought in today’s agriculture suggests that Dust Bowl-type droughts today would have unprecedented consequences, with yield losses about 50% larger than the severe drought of 2012 (Glotter and Elliott 2016). Damages at these extremes are highly sensitive to temperature, worsening by about 25% with each degree centigrade of warming. By mid-century, over 80% of summers are projected to have average temperatures that are likely to exceed the hottest summer in the Dust Bowl years (1936) (Glotter and Elliott 2016).</span></div><div left="595.24" right="601.48" top="268.29"><span style="x0: 595.24; x1: 601.48; y0: 268.29; y1: 280.29; width: 6.24; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0];" x0="595.24" y0="268.29" x1="601.48" class="s1062">5</span></div><div left="83.2" right="553.73" top="723.11"><span style="x0: 83.2; x1: 88.65; y0: 723.11; y1: 732.61; width: 5.45; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="83.2" y0="723.11" x1="553.73" class="s1063">How a shortfall in production – or an interruption in trade due to an event affecting a logistics choke-point (Wellesley et al. 2017) – of any given magnitude may create impacts depends on many interacting factors (Homer-Dixon et al. 2015; Tadasse et al. 2016; Challinor et al. 2018). The principal route is by affecting agricultural commodity markets, which respond to a perturbation through multiple routes as in Figure 5.17. This includes pressures from other sectors (such as, if biofuels policy is incentivising crops for the production of ethanol, as happened in 2007–2008). The market response can be amplified by poor policies, setting up trade and non-trade barriers to exports, from countries seeking to ensure their local food security (Bailey et al. 2015).

Some studies linked the drought to widespread crop failure, but the climate hypothesis has been contested (Selby et al. 2017; Hendrix 2018).

Food supply chain activities past the farm gate (e.g., transportation, storage, packaging) also emit GHGs, for instance due to energy use. GHG emissions from food production vary across food types. Producing animal-sourced food (e.g., meat and dairy) emits larger amount of GHGs than growing crops, especially in intensive, industrial livestock systems. This is mainly true for commodities produced by ruminant livestock such as cattle, due to enteric fermentation processes that are large emitters of methane. Changing diets towards a lower share of animal-sourced food, once implemented at scale, reduces the need to raise livestock and changes crop production from animal feed to human food. This reduces the need for agricultural land compared to present and thus generates changes in the current food system. From field to consumer this would reduce overall GHG emissions. Changes in consumer behaviour beyond dietary changes, such as reduction of food waste, can also have, at scale, effects on overall GHG emissions from food systems. Consuming regional and seasonal food can reduce GHG emissions, if they are grown efficiently.</span></div><div left="27.53" right="33.77" top="268.29"><span style="x0: 27.53; x1: 33.77; y0: 268.29; y1: 280.29; width: 6.24; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0];" x0="27.53" y0="268.29" x1="33.77" class="s1062">5</span></div><div left="59.53" right="114.53" top="734.48"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 66.2; y0: 734.48; y1: 746.48; width: 6.67; fill: [1, 0.87, 0.34, 0.3];" x0="59.53" y0="734.48" x1="114.53" class="s1189">References</span></div><div left="59.53" right="307.32" top="707.35"><span style="x0: 59.53; x1: 64.41; y0: 707.35; y1: 715.85; width: 4.88; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="59.53" y0="707.35" x1="307.32" class="s2866">Abarca-Gómez, L. et al., 2017: Worldwide trends in body-mass index, underweight, overweight, and obesity from 1975 to 2016: A pooled analysis of 2416 population-based measurement studies in 128·9 million children, adolescents, and adults. </span><span style="x0: 179.36; x1: 182.82; y0: 674.35; y1: 682.85; width: 3.46; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="179.36" y0="674.35" x1="200.45" class="s1207">Lancet</span><span style="x0: 200.45; x1: 202.49; y0: 674.35; y1: 682.85; width: 2.04; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="200.45" y0="674.35" x1="204.21" class="s2866">, </span><span style="x0: 205.06; x1: 209.48; y0: 674.35; y1: 682.85; width: 4.42; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="205.06" y0="674.35" x1="218.32" class="s2869">390</span><span style="x0: 218.32; x1: 220.36; y0: 674.35; y1: 682.85; width: 2.04; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="218.32" y0="674.35" x1="305.29" class="s2866">, 2627–2642, doi:10.1016/ S0140-6736(17)32129-3.Abbas, G. et al., 2017: Quantification the impacts of climate change and crop management on phenology of maize-based cropping system in Punjab, Pakistan. </span><span style="x0: 132.02; x1: 136.89; y0: 630.35; y1: 638.85; width: 4.88; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1];" x0="132.02" y0="630.35" x1="203.88" class="s1207">Agric.
