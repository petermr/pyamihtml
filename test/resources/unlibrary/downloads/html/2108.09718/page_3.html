This may make digital technologies easy and cheap to replicate and share, even globally (Yoo et al., 2010). &#8220;Digital&#8221; therefore implies the capability to re-program, modularize and recombine, build upon, and share digital goods, potentially enabling their appropriation and modification to build relevance in multiple local contexts. This flexibility allows digital technologies to have generativity (Zittrain, 2008) reflected in the success of commercial digital platform ecosystems such as those around iOS and Android, reaping the benefits of positive network effects (Tiwana, 2013). However, Sahay (2019) points out that appropriation of the digital in  multiple contexts is not an unproblematic given, but shaped by various &#8220;distortions&#8221; such as related to knowledge, capacity and local politics. Understanding the nature of these distortions and how to engage with them, helps shape local relevance. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.46" top="613.71"><span x0="62.9" y0="613.71" x1="541.46" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 74.23; y0: 613.71; y1: 625.71; width: 11.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">We have so far briefly introduced public goods, global public goods and digital technologies. Public goods points towards market failure and the need for collective action, global public goods does the same on a global scale, and digital technologies have the nature of being inherently flexible for appropriation in a local context. DGPGs represents a combination of these defining criteria. First, they are designed to be available to anyone free of charge without any license costs. Second, they are relevant in local contexts on a global scale by not being prohibitively difficult to learn how to use, implement, and appropriate. We thus adopt a wide understanding of accessibility, to include digital goods being understood, capable of being influenced, capable of being adapted and appropriated. The notion of accessibility thus relates not just to ease of acquisition, but more importantly how easy they are for users to understand, utilize and make relevant in context. There are mutual dependencies between these constituent parts, shaped broadly by the process and capabilities of making the goods locally relevant. In a self-reinforcing cycle, global use adds the contextual diversity necessary to develop for global relevance, but also raises the challenge of the goods becoming too generic and offering a &#8216;design from nowhere&#8217; (Suchman, 2002). An open source application that is prohibitively difficult to re-program, adjust, or localize, becomes less of a DGPG. A DGPG can as such be understood as a whole which is more than the sum of its parts. We summarize our perspective of DGPGs in the table below: </span></div><div left="68.42" right="535.65" top="369.42"><span x0="68.42" y0="369.42" x1="535.65" style="x0: 68.42; x1: 75.62; y0: 369.42; y1: 379.38; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;">Digital Global Public Goods are digital goods designed as non-rivalrous, non-excludable, locally relevant on a global scale. </span></div><div left="68.42" right="125.31" top="335.1"><span x0="68.42" y0="335.1" x1="125.31" style="x0: 68.42; x1: 74.51; y0: 335.1; y1: 345.06; width: 6.09; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Public Goods</span><span x0="172.61" y0="335.22" x1="350.66" style="x0: 172.61; x1: 179.8; y0: 335.22; y1: 345.18; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Non-rivalrous and non-excludable by design</span></div><div left="68.42" right="97.32" top="312.54"><span x0="68.42" y0="312.54" x1="97.32" style="x0: 68.42; x1: 75.62; y0: 312.54; y1: 322.5; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Digital</span><span x0="172.61" y0="312.66" x1="377.43" style="x0: 172.61; x1: 179.25; y0: 312.66; y1: 322.62; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Re-programmable, modularized and re-combinable</span></div><div left="68.42" right="99.83" top="289.95"><span x0="68.42" y0="289.95" x1="99.83" style="x0: 68.42; x1: 76.17; y0: 289.95; y1: 299.91; width: 7.75; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Global </span><span x0="172.61" y0="290.07" x1="309.76" style="x0: 172.61; x1: 179.25; y0: 290.07; y1: 300.03; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Relevant locally on a global scale </span></div><div left="68.42" right="165.14" top="267.39"><span x0="68.42" y0="267.39" x1="165.14" style="x0: 68.42; x1: 75.62; y0: 267.39; y1: 277.35; width: 7.19; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">DGPG as more than the sum of the parts </span><span x0="172.61" y0="267.51" x1="533.24" style="x0: 172.61; x1: 179.25; y0: 267.51; y1: 277.47; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.96; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Relevance on a global scale can only be achieved with adaptability, provided by non-excludable, non-rivalrous, digitally modifiable technologies.

We selected a case study as they are &#8220;particularly useful in the early stages of research on a new topic, when not a lot is known about it&#8221; (Myers, 2001, p. 89). While the history of DHIS2 is reported in many research papers (Adu-Gyamfi et al., 2019; Braa et al., 2007; Roland et al., 2017) and more than 50 PhD theses, we draw upon Braa and Sahay&#8217;s (2012) description of the transitions in history of the initiative, which we also updated to current time. To highlight local relevance, we identified and focus on 3 key sets of processes: i) participation of users; ii) building of capacity and local support mechanisms; </span></div></body></html>
