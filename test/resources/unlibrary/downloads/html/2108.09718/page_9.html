DHIS2 shows how the digital and the global nature of DGPGs are intertwined. For example, a platform architecture can allow both shared stable resources and flexibility for specific, local development (Roland et al., 2017). Careful work with boundary resources can lower the bar for local adaptations (Li &amp; Nielsen, 2019). At the same time, the focus on the dual mission of making the technology a globally relevant platform to be used across different use-cases and domains, has implications on the relationship between the developers and the users. While the core developers started out with a very intimate relationship with the users and the context in the early 1990&#8217;s, this is the case no more. At the same time, with the platform architecture of DHIS2, local expertise has the flexibility to implement solutions relevant in the local context. The local experts do also have the possibility to change DHIS2 by feeding new requirements, use-cases and innovations back to the core-team. However, this requires them to invest time in understanding whether this is a common requirement across context and describing the use-cases in a way acceptable by the core team. Such initiatives will also be considered in light of what else is on the roadmap, and finally decided by the core team. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.21" top="558.48"><span x0="62.9" y0="558.48" x1="541.21" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 70.24; y0: 558.48; y1: 570.48; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The case of DHIS2 and its development over time shows the relationship between the constituents of DGPG and in particular the relationship between accessibility and local relevance. While accessibility in terms of users being able to download a software platform is relatively easy to achieve, developing the skillsets of the users to understand the software, implement it effectively and putting it to use in a way that leads to better decisions is a different story. We argue that the relative success of DHIS2 hinges not only on the qualities of the software and its abilities, but also the global efforts put into building local capacities and regional support mechanisms for its implementation and use.  </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.43" top="442.06"><span x0="62.9" y0="442.06" x1="541.43" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 70.24; y0: 442.06; y1: 454.06; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The paper contributes theoretically by providing a novel definition and conceptualization of DGPG illustrated with the case of DHIS2. The definition contributes analytical support towards improved understanding of the role of DGPGs in socio-economic development in particular a recognition of the importance of the &#8220;demand side&#8221;. A limitation of the paper is that we do not in depth discuss practical contributions for producers of DGPGs. While this will be the focus of further enquiry, we hope to direct attention to a renewed emphasis on a broader perspective on accessibility and relevance for users. Users and policy makers may draw on the lessons of the case illustrations when considering investment and implementation of DGPGs.</span></div><div left="63.02" right="157.13" top="317.42"><span x0="63.02" y0="317.42" x1="157.13" style="x0: 63.02; x1: 73.16; y0: 317.42; y1: 331.46; width: 10.14; font-size: 14.04; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">REFERENCES</span><span x0="63.02" y0="300.79" x1="541.38" style="x0: 63.02; x1: 71.69; y0: 300.79; y1: 312.79; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Adu-Gyamfi, E., Nielsen, P., &amp; S&#230;b&#248;, Johan.
