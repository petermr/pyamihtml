Arguably, these aspects contribute to the development of local relevance, which we define as &#8220;the capabilities of the local context to effective use the DGPG platform to meet local needs, while contributing to the global scalability of the platform.&#8221; </span></div><div left="63.02" right="541.68" top="710.31"><span x0="63.02" y0="710.31" x1="541.68" style="x0: 63.02; x1: 74.35; y0: 710.31; y1: 722.31; width: 11.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">We first provide a brief overview of the background of the DHIS2 initiative, ongoing over 2 decades, and then discuss the aspects of local relevance over the four identified phases of its evolution.  </span></div><div left="62.9" right="296.35" top="670.71"><span x0="62.9" y0="670.71" x1="296.35" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 68.9; y0: 670.71; y1: 682.71; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">3.1.

The first version of the software (DHIS1) was developed in South Africa and was transformed into the web based DHIS2 platform in 2006. It has slowly grown in maturity with new capabilities and improved functionalities; attracted global attention and funding, and experienced increasing adoption in more than 70 countries in the Global South (see www.dhis2.org).

The design, development and dissemination of DHIS2 is coordinated by the Department of Informatics at University of Oslo (UiO) under the Health Information Systems Programme (HISP), where it represents a key focus of research and education.  </span></div><div left="62.9" right="363.79" top="476.28"><span x0="62.9" y0="476.28" x1="363.79" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 68.9; y0: 476.28; y1: 488.28; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">3.2.

The process of reform was driven by a team of South African activists returning to the country from exile and researchers from UiO immersed in the Scandinavian approach to participatory design and action research. Emancipation of the field level health workers through decentralization was the underlying agenda guiding the technology development process (Braa &amp; Hedberg, 2002). This was the birth of the HISP initiative with the priority to establish an integrated and decentralized health system, and the development of district health information system software became the focal point and the Version 1 (DHIS1) was born. The development progressed as a highly participatory and multi-disciplinary process, driven primarily by national nurses and doctors, who would give requirements and the development team would respond with rapid prototypes, often on a daily basis. Braa and Sahay (2012) describe this process as the technology was used as Lego bricks where the DHIS1 development and reconstruction of the health system took place as mutually reinforcing and inextricably intertwined processes. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.65" top="260.23"><span x0="62.9" y0="260.23" x1="541.65" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 69.58; y0: 260.23; y1: 272.23; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Process of capacity building and local support mechanisms: An NGO HISP South Africa was born which was anchored within the School of Public Health at the University of Western Cape. Capacity building was at the core of the local support provision, as the university initiated various short term summer and winter courses, many of which were run by HISP South Africa team members, and thousands of health staff attended the courses (Braa et al., 2004). Additionally, the HISP South Africa team would carry out in-service training for health staff in their work contexts. The software development took place from a base in Western Cape, with strong linkages established between the development, implementation and user teams. The capacity building and support mechanisms can be summarized as taking place in the mode of &#8220;for and in the local context&#8221; of the country. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.47" top="130.01"><span x0="62.9" y0="130.01" x1="541.47" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 70.24; y0: 130.01; y1: 142.01; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Technology development process: The first version of DHIS was open source and built using Visual Basic and Microsoft Access and implemented based on standalone installations in the health facilities. The development team was located at the University of Western Cape (UWC) and consisted of two core software developers and a group of HISP members acting as mediators between users and the developers. Based on rapid prototyping cycles in close collaboration with users in selected health facilities, the software matured, it was scaled to provincial level and finally </span></div></body></html>
