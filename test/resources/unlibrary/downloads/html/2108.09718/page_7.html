Phase 4: (2013 to current): Dealing with high global and national scaling </span><span x0="62.9" y0="754.71" x1="541.51" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 69.58; y0: 754.71; y1: 766.71; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Processes of participation: Participation was now organized primarily at two levels. One, country teams (HISP groups) organized their own processes of participation in respective country contexts, with mixed results. While South Africa continued their relative mature modes of participation through secondment of a number of their staff to provincial and national governments, other countries showed relatively reduced levels of engagement with users and a stronger focus on building more technical skills on the DHIS2, which was evolving at a high speed. Two, the UiO team largely engaged with countries through the mediating HISP groups rather than directly with users, which was now no longer possible given the scale of operations (Roland et al., 2017). Further, the models of funding were also rapidly changing, as till around 2012 nearly all development was carried out by students supported through research council funds, now different donor money was being obtained. An implication of this shift was that the priorities of the donors tended to be emphasized over country voices, reducing the impetus on engaging user participation.  </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.64" top="583.08"><span x0="62.9" y0="583.08" x1="541.64" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 69.58; y0: 583.08; y1: 595.08; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Process of capacity building and local support mechanisms: About ten HISP groups were established around the developing world (for example, in India, Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania, West Africa, Vietnam) and there was increasing focus (and funds) to strengthen their capacities, primarily around the customization and use of DHIS2. A key mechanism for this was through the UiO supported &#8220;DHIS2 Academies&#8221; arranged periodically in different regions on topics of system development, implementation, server management, app development and so on (since 2011, around 100 academies have had around 5000 participants). The DHIS2 Academies are arranged by the HISP groups in their regions, sometimes supported by UiO core team members. In 2017, a free online academy is also offered on &#8220;Fundamentals of DHIS2&#8221;, and more such courses are in the process of development. There is also an Annual DHIS2 Conference, where representatives from NGOs, MoHs and researchers share learnings and showcase innovation and best practices. These have contributed to building a vibrant global community of practice and network of practitioners around DHIS2. These activities are at the same time at a distance from users in developing countries. This challenge has been recognized by UiO and various measures are being undertaken to reduce this gap. For example, recently &#8220;regional HISP groups&#8221; were established in South Asia, East Africa and West Africa, to enable pooling of regional capacities so as to better organize country support. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.41" top="356.26"><span x0="62.9" y0="356.26" x1="541.41" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 70.24; y0: 356.26; y1: 368.26; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Technology development process: The technology development processes have rapidly moved towards increased professionalization and specialization, from the early days when students conducted the development. Today there is a professional team of more than 30 developers, distributed globally, and organized on lines of a modern software house with different teams including front-end and back-end. To provide support for the implementation and use in a variety of context and for different use-cases, DHIS2 is based on the newest of technologies and a platform architecture. DHIS2 is a Java-based web application and runs on multiple platforms, and is interoperable with other relevant applications in the domain. It is available in many languages and has support for local contribution to a repository of translations. Participation is also promoted by an online community platform, mailing lists, source code repositories, and issue tracker. </span></div><div left="63.02" right="541.33" top="212.23"><span x0="63.02" y0="212.23" x1="541.33" style="x0: 63.02; x1: 74.35; y0: 212.23; y1: 224.23; width: 11.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">With its generic core and platform architecture, DHIS2 provide interfaces that allows the development of apps to suite local needs and integration with other systems. From being a tool primarily used for collection, aggregation and presentation of aggregate health data, the platform has facilitated new use cases including patient management and individual records. This versatility is also illustrated by the implementation and use of DHIS2 for health commodity logistics management and in agriculture and education. However, taking advantage of the openness and flexibility of the platform requires competence and human capacity (Msiska &amp; Nielsen, 2018). There are different initiatives to support participation including the development of different kinds of boundary resources, such as component libraries, tutorials, and documentation. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.46" top="82.01"><span x0="62.9" y0="82.01" x1="541.46" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 66.9; y0: 82.01; y1: 94.01; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">In summary, in this phase the focus has been on building global rather than local relevance, which is inevitable given the scale and associated funding mechanisms. The ongoing challenge is to </span></div></body></html>
