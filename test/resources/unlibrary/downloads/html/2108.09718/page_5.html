The software developers and public health implementers and users worked closely together in a small and agile team, and their ongoing interactions contributed to the rapid scaling of the systems, till it became a national standard by 2001.  </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.37" top="724.11"><span x0="62.9" y0="724.11" x1="541.37" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 66.9; y0: 724.11; y1: 736.11; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">In summary, with respect to local relevance, the initiative was strong in processes of participation, capacity building and local support. While the software was locally relevant in South Africa, it was not globally scalable, as was evidenced in the next phase of evolution.  </span></div><div left="62.9" right="416.38" top="670.71"><span x0="62.9" y0="670.71" x1="416.38" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 68.9; y0: 670.71; y1: 682.71; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">3.3. Phase 2 (2001 to 2008): Exploring potential of scaling of DHIS1 </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.41" top="653.91"><span x0="62.9" y0="653.91" x1="541.41" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 69.58; y0: 653.91; y1: 665.91; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Processes of participation: Two sets of processes were at the core of shaping participation in this phase. One, there was a process of taking the DHIS1 from South Africa to multiple other countries such as Mozambique, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Malawi, India and Cuba. Participation processes were attempted in different (from South Africa) political contexts and resulted in systemic challenges such as the top down and hierarchical political structure of Cuba that did not accept the bottom up and activist approach of South Africa, leading to the HISP initiative to be abruptly terminated (S&#230;b&#248; &amp; Titlestad, 2004). Funded by Norad, UiO worked on establishing strong research and education programmes in collaboration with national universities and Ministries of Health (MoH). For example, 6 faculty members from the Universidade Eduardo Mondlane (UEM) in Mozambique enrolled for the PhD programme at UiO working in an action research mode on topics of relevance for the MoH. Simultaneously, a Masters programme in Health Informatics was established in collaboration with UiO. Similar models of engagement were established in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Malawi. These changes firstly strengthened three way links between UiO, the local universities and the MoHs, and the action research mode provided a more academic mode to participatory processes. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.5" top="454.66"><span x0="62.9" y0="454.66" x1="541.5" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 69.58; y0: 454.66; y1: 466.66; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Process of capacity building and local support mechanisms: The onus of organizing and managing these processes largely shifted to the settings of the universities, with students at the core within the framework of their research projects. This shift came with its particular strengths and weaknesses. The obvious strength was this process sought to strengthen national institutional processes of tertiary education and health information capacity in the MoH. Such strengthening would contribute to enhanced sustainability of efforts and systems. A weakness of this model was that unlike South Africa where an NGO was responsible for supporting DHIS implementation, and could rapidly respond to user needs, in Mozambique for example, the support was bound in various layers of bureaucracy of their respective universities and the MoH. As a result, support could not be provided in time in relation to the urgency required. This greatly adversely affected the implementation outcomes. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.49" top="296.83"><span x0="62.9" y0="296.83" x1="541.49" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 70.24; y0: 296.83; y1: 308.83; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Technology development process: The point of departure for this process was the DHIS1 developed in South Africa. The process of translating this to the country contexts met with multiple design-reality gaps (Nhampossa, 2005). For example, there was the issue of language, as for example to Portuguese in Mozambique. There were different underlying logics of working, for example while in South Africa with the agenda of empowerment and &#8220;local use of information&#8221;, a primary focus was on the development and use of pivot tools, in Mozambique the users wanted ready-made report generation functionality rather than having to develop it themselves. The technology support for these countries still came from South Africa, and because of the limitations of a standalone system, laptops would need to be sent from Mozambique to South Africa, who would then install the new version incorporating required fixes and send it back to Mozambique. As can be imagined, this was a very cumbersome and time-consuming process, and did not contribute effectively to local technical capacity development. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.28" top="125.21"><span x0="62.9" y0="125.21" x1="541.28" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 66.9; y0: 125.21; y1: 137.21; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">In summary, with respect to local relevance, longer term and institutionalized processes of participation and capacity building were arguably established, but unlike in South Africa, it was inadequate to meet the short-term implementation needs. The DHIS1 was found to be inherently non-scalable. The result of this was in Mozambique, Ethiopia and Cuba, the HISP projects were </span></div></body></html>
