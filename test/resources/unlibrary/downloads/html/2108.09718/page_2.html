To address this gap in the literature, this paper sets out with two aims. The first concerns building an improved understanding and definition of the nature of a digital public goods, which we do by proposing the term Digital Global Public Goods (DGPGs), drawing on concepts of public goods and global public good and unpacking an understanding of the digital in development. Second, we illustrate this definition by drawing on the case of the District Health Information System (DHIS2) software over the last 2 decades. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.45" top="682.71"><span x0="62.9" y0="682.71" x1="541.45" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 70.24; y0: 682.71; y1: 694.71; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in the next section we develop a definition of DGPG based on discussing relevant literature concerning DPGs. In the following section, we provide a case study and analysis of DHIS2, a digital platform for public health in developing countries (see www.dhis2.org). We frame our analysis of DHIS2 as a DGPG and base our discussion on published works related to DHIS2 and on the authors&#8217; ongoing and long-term theoretical and practical engagement with the design, development, and implementation of DHIS2 </span></div><div left="62.9" right="334.66" top="585.64"><span x0="62.9" y0="585.64" x1="334.66" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 69.92; y0: 585.64; y1: 599.68; width: 7.02; font-size: 14.04; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">2.

Non-rivalry means that consumption by one individual does not subtract what is available for others to consume, and non-excludability means that one cannot prevent anyone from using the good (or it is prohibitively expensive to do so). The concept of public goods originates from economics (Samuelson, 1954) where a prevailing focus is on the undersupply of public goods in a free market. Without prospects of payment, there will be limited economic incentives to provide the good, despite the high aggregate benefit to society. Some coordination of collective action to supply them is necessary, which is typically the realm of the public sector. Typical examples of public goods in the literature include infrastructure (lighthouses and streetlights), environment (clean air and disease control), and public services (immunization, fire stations and national defense). The production of public goods results in positive externalities, i.e. benefits for third parties that did not agree to consume and pay for the good. For example, lighthouses will benefit all seafarers, their families, and customers of the transported goods too. Immunization will lead to herd immunity, which is beneficial also for those not vaccinated. While public goods are by default non-exclusive, technological change may alter this by bringing down the cost of enforcing payment. An example of this is introduction of cost-efficient automatic toll roads where previously the road was free to use. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.6" top="308.38"><span x0="62.9" y0="308.38" x1="541.6" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 70.24; y0: 308.38; y1: 320.38; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The concept of global public goods (GPG) represent an approach to capture the global challenges in enabling access to public goods that transcend national borders (Kaul, 2013). It puts emphasis on the related costs and benefits and the accessibility to public goods across geographies, social and economic groups, gender, and generations (Kaul et al., 1999). This concept is widely applied across many areas related to socio-economic development including the environment, international financial stability, peace and security, human rights (Long &amp; Woolley, 2009) as well as the area of global health (Moon et al., 2017; Smith &amp; MacKellar, 2007).  </span></div><div left="63.02" right="541.32" top="205.75"><span x0="63.02" y0="205.75" x1="541.32" style="x0: 63.02; x1: 71.69; y0: 205.75; y1: 217.75; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">GPGs take an important role in discussions on global agendas, goals and the establishment of governance structures to create incentives for different groups to contribute with their share (Kaul et al., 1999). Even if public goods are global and not produced by a single nation, they can only be realized by several countries taking policy initiatives on national levels and through international cooperation (Kaul et al., 2003). However, critics have raised a concern that there is a tendency to uncritically apply the concept of global public goods to the level that it loses its meaning and becomes a &#8216;buzzword&#8217; to attract funding (Smith &amp; MacKellar, 2007), which makes the term incoherent and abstract (Long &amp; Woolley, 2009).  </span></div><div left="62.9" right="112.69" top="89.33"><span x0="62.9" y0="89.33" x1="112.69" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 71.57; y0: 89.33; y1: 101.33; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">How may </span><span x0="112.7" y0="89.33" x1="147.14" style="x0: 112.7; x1: 118.7; y0: 89.33; y1: 101.33; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;">digital </span><span x0="147.14" y0="89.33" x1="541.65" style="x0: 147.14; x1: 153.14; y0: 89.33; y1: 101.33; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">global public goods be conceptualized?
