Recent studies have examined the importance of digital artefacts with public goods traits, emphasizing the significant potential for socio-economic development. However, we know little about the theoretical and practical dimensions of how we can align the public goods traits of such artefacts to create relevance in the context they are implemented. To address this gap we review the literature firstly to develop a definition and conceptual basis of DGPGs and then to illustrate the importance of relevance: how to align DGPGs with context to meet local needs. The illustration draws from a case study of the District Health Information systems (DHIS2). The paper advances both the theoretical and practical understanding of DPGs in development processes. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="121.82" top="444.22"><span x0="62.9" y0="444.22" x1="121.82" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 72.24; y0: 444.22; y1: 456.22; width: 9.34; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Keywords: </span><span x0="121.82" y0="444.46" x1="388.35" style="x0: 121.82; x1: 127.82; y0: 444.46; y1: 456.46; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">public goods, digital public goods, global public goods </span></div><div left="62.9" right="76.2" top="401.09"><span x0="62.9" y0="401.09" x1="76.2" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 69.58; y0: 401.09; y1: 413.09; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: Arial-BoldMT;">1. </span><span x0="99.02" y0="398.9" x1="211.15" style="x0: 99.02; x1: 104.49; y0: 398.9; y1: 412.94; width: 5.46; font-size: 14.04; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">INTRODUCTION</span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.64" top="381.94"><span x0="62.9" y0="381.94" x1="541.64" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 71.57; y0: 381.94; y1: 393.94; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">National socio-economic development processes are becoming increasingly intertwined with digital technologies.  Digital technologies are flexible and multipurpose by being reprogrammable and based on combinable and reusable components. They are standard based to handle a variety of digital contents and to allow innovation by the many. Many low and lower middle-income countries (LLMICs) have positioned the digital at the center of their reform agendas (Heeks, 2020). In the increasingly complex and interconnected development landscape, digital public goods (DPGs) are being positioned as the core platform on which to build the digital solutions upon. The UN Secretary-General&#8217;s High-level Roadmap for Digital Cooperation defines digital public goods as &#8220;open-source software, open data, open artificial intelligence models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable international and domestic laws, standards and best practices and do no harm&#8221; (United Nations, 2020, p. 35). The same report states that &#8220;digital public goods are essential in unlocking the full potential of digital technologies and data to attain the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular for low- and middle-income countries&#8221; (United Nations, 2020, p. 8). A range of associated organizations and initiatives adopt similar definitions, sometimes with a specific normative addition that DPGs should help attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One such organization is the Digital Public Goods Alliance, a multi-stakeholder initiative to provide a one-stop-shop on information about DPGs. Digital Square, another such multi-stakeholder initiative, seeks to be a &#8220;marketplace&#8221; of DPGs for health as &#8220;investment opportunities&#8221; for global health organizations. These initiatives are influential in setting priorities for digital technologies in international development and raising concerns around ethics, development agendas and funding concerns.  </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.62" top="86.21"><span x0="62.9" y0="86.21" x1="541.62" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 71.57; y0: 86.21; y1: 98.21; width: 8.66; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">A limitation of the above definitions relates to the simplistic tendency to equate free and open source software with DPG status, which we argue over-emphasizes the production side of the DPG, including the processes of design, development and distribution, whilst not paying adequate </span></div></body></html>
