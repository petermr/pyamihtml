Phase 3: (2008 to 2012):  Transition to the web-based version </span><span x0="62.9" y0="715.11" x1="541.5" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 69.58; y0: 715.11; y1: 727.11; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Processes of participation: The initial years of this transition involved building participation around the development of the web-based version DHIS2. Two key conditions shaped this participation process. One, the development process shifted from South Africa to the Department of Informatics at UiO and was now driven primarily by Masters and PhD students. They were then both geographically and culturally distant from the contexts of use. Two, the strong multi-disciplinary approach born in South Africa, was replaced by a primarily technical approach with focus on novel rather than appropriate technologies, which implied losing the public health anchoring. For example, the DHIS2 was based on a stack of Java based technologies, skills for which was relatively limited in many developing countries. There were also infrastructure constraints. For example in the Ethiopian national university, there were severe internet constraints, which meant the local developers could not download the new builds released by the UiO developers. Processes of mutual participation of the UiO and country teams was severely constrained during this process of new technology development.   </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.52" top="529.68"><span x0="62.9" y0="529.68" x1="541.52" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 69.58; y0: 529.68; y1: 541.68; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Process of capacity building and local support mechanisms: Many of the doctoral candidates from countries started to complete their PhDs and go back to their countries and take up positions in their universities or MoH. This helped to strengthen institutional capacities while also participating in teaching of the Masters programmes now established and running well. Some new countries like Sri Lanka and Malawi also established their respective programmes, slowly leading to the development of more global health informatics capacities made relevant to their country contexts. Some other countries, like India, Vietnam and Bangladesh established local NGOs (called HISP groups) to support local implementations, and developed their own means and mechanisms of participation guided by various factors such as political contexts, available resources and capacities, and the agreements they had with their respective governments. While a diversity of participatory processes grew during this period, a common theme was it was becoming increasingly technical and distant from users. The UiO team&#8217;s engagement in participation was now largely mediated by the country support structures. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.38" top="344.26"><span x0="62.9" y0="344.26" x1="541.38" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 70.24; y0: 344.26; y1: 356.26; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Technology development process: The DHIS2 was born in the state of Kerala in India, jointly developed and piloted in one clinic by a team of UiO and HISP India developers. The web-based nature of DHIS2 made it immediately attractive to governments, and 3-4 states in India and other countries (Sierra Leone and Kenya) initiated processes to pilot and implement DHIS2 in their contexts. As a team of developers from Oslo relocated to Kenya to carry out development in context, some major breakthroughs were achieved, for example Kenya became the first African country to achieve a national roll out of a web based HIS (Manya et al., 2012). There was a rapid evolution of the functionalities of DHIS2 making it more amenable to both local customization and also their global scaling. For example, Gizaw et al. (2016) advanced the concept of &#8220;open generification&#8221; using examples of how locally developed functionalities (such as for mortality reporting in Ethiopia and category combinations in Tajikistan) could become part of the DHIS2 core and made available to the world at large. The growth of DHIS2 caught the attention of global partners, such as WHO and Global fund, and processes of supporting DHIS2 development were initiated leading to a rapid increase in the uptake of DHIS2 in countries. </span></div><div left="62.9" right="541.34" top="145.01"><span x0="62.9" y0="145.01" x1="541.34" style="x0: 62.9; x1: 66.9; y0: 145.01; y1: 157.01; width: 4.0; font-size: 12.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">In summary, local relevance was some ways compromised with the change in the character of participation, but the use of more modern technologies enhanced its use in multiple local contexts. Local support mechanisms through HISP groups was strengthened as increasingly governments started to rely on the DHIS2, placing pressure on its continued maintenance and support.  </span></div></body></html>
