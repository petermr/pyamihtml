Catalytic action of this type could then be brought to the formal institutions for broader consultation, wider negotiations and ul-timately rejection or endorsement by the broader community of states. This wider process is absolutely necessary. But the composition of a Global 25 would substantially increase the likelihood that its proposals would generate support and acceptance, and thus implementation. With these core functions there could be additional benefits to such a grouping. It could examine, in ways beyond the capacity of the exist-ing institutions, the inter-connections between issues normally treated separately and create a forum for the heads of the major international institutions to regularly meet and generate more effective collaboration. It could also demand and generate evidence-based research, monitoring and evaluation. And it could encourage innovation in public and private sector financing of global public goods. At this divided international moment, the mere composition of such a forum could send a powerful signal about the need for cooperation, about the importance of bridging regional and political divides and about common global responsibilities to tackle common global ills. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="226.3" top="255.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="255.65" x1="226.3" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.39; y0: 255.65; y1: 265.65; width: 7.29; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Conditions for an effective Global 25 forum</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.68" top="227.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="227.65" x1="337.68" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">A Global 25 forum at the level of heads of state and government could achieve these benefits under three conditions: </span><span x0="72.1" y0="199.65" x1="223.01" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 80.64; y0: 199.65; y1: 209.65; width: 8.54; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Membership as a reflection of contributions. </span><span x0="222.42" y0="199.65" x1="337.65" style="x0: 222.42; x1: 231.59; y0: 199.65; y1: 209.65; width: 9.17; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Membership in such a forum should not be based solely on financial size, population size or military power.
