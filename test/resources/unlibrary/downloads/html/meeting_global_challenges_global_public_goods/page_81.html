This group would not need to grant unilaterally an offer of agricultural reform and aid for trade; the Quad could make it conditional upon satisfactory completion of the other key issues included in the Doha Development Agenda. Capacity building for trade, and trade-related technical assis-tance, should also be expanded. It should include training, seminars and studies, as well as support for the design and implementation of trade policy.</span><span x0="157.89" y0="511.96" x1="163.57" style="x0: 157.89; x1: 160.74; y0: 511.96; y1: 517.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">81</span></div><div left="147.66" right="413.26" top="493.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="493.65" x1="413.26" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.43; y0: 493.65; y1: 503.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">An agreement of this kind among the Quad members most likely would have a powerful catalytic effect on the rest of the WTO member- ship. Other developed countries resistant until now to remove agricul-tural barriers would have to reconsider their positions. Large developing countries, that have had in rich countries&#8217; farm protectionism a &#8220;good reason&#8221; (or the perfect excuse) for not moving in the negotiations, would also find compromise towards a good agreement to be inescap-able. Finally, a solvent aid for trade fund would help in bringing other developing countries on board. </span></div></body></html>
