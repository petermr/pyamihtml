Specifically, we believe that the UN system&#8212;in particular, its specialized agencies&#8212;has a critical role to play in the provision of issue-specific knowledge and coordination of action to negotiate and to implement agreements for the provision of global public goods. And independent evaluation of the performance of UN agencies, funds and programmes would help enhance their credibility. Greater use of evidence-based research and more consistent monitor-ing of state compliance with international obligations would allow UN system entities to report on global developments and serve as centres of specialized knowledge, as hubs of professional networks, of interest to all countries. In short, it would allow them to play a more pro-active role on global issues and in shaping the provision of global public goods. Such reforms are necessary to enhance the accountability of interna-tional institutions both within the UN system and beyond. We now turn to these reforms in greater detail.</span></div><div left="132.66" right="203.56" top="129.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="129.8" x1="203.56" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.51; y0: 129.8; y1: 139.8; width: 6.85; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Accountability </span></div><div left="132.66" right="410.5" top="101.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="101.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.58; y0: 101.65; y1: 111.65; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Here we elaborate a set of reforms that would generate improved trans-parency&#8212;a critical component of accountability.
