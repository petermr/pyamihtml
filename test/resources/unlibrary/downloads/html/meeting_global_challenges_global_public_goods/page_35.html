The rapid growth of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the conclusion of a land mine ban are examples of the accomplishments of these partnerships. And while there are some grounds for concern that private and civic action allows governments to evade their basic responsibilities, the fact is that these new actors and initiatives bring energy, private capital and specialized and highly localized knowledge to the challenge of tackling complex local and global problems.</span><span x0="237.44" y0="497.96" x1="241.92" style="x0: 237.44; x1: 240.29; y0: 497.96; y1: 503.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">8 </span></div><div left="147.66" right="179.73" top="479.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="479.65" x1="179.73" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.64; y0: 479.65; y1: 489.65; width: 6.98; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Regions </span><span x0="180.54" y0="479.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 180.54; x1: 185.75; y0: 479.65; y1: 489.65; width: 5.21; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">have also cooperated to tackle common problems, with important results. In 1974, 11 West African countries came together with international agencies to combat river blindness. The Oncho- cerciasis Control Program (to give the disease its proper name) suc-ceeded over 25 years in halting transmission of the disease in all 11 countries, sparing an estimated 600,000 people from its effects&#8212;at an annual cost of less than $1 per protected person. And European countries acted together to combat acid rain emanating from Eu-rope, forging the 1979 Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution.And far away from the spotlight of global attention, </span><span x0="365.24" y0="339.65" x1="413.25" style="x0: 365.24; x1: 367.64; y0: 339.65; y1: 349.65; width: 2.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">international technical agencies </span><span x0="198.08" y0="325.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 198.08; x1: 203.29; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 5.21; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">have set global standards for telecommunication, in-ternational banking, trade and financial transactions, civil aviation and much else besides.</span><span x0="206.92" y0="301.96" x1="209.78" style="x0: 206.92; x1: 209.78; y0: 301.96; y1: 307.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">9</span><span x0="212.25" y0="297.65" x1="413.19" style="x0: 212.25; x1: 219.02; y0: 297.65; y1: 307.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">These mechanisms for technical cooperation and standard setting have enabled phenomenal growth in technology, trade and communications. Several of these initiatives have been led, encour-aged or financed by the private sector, recognizing their own interest in effective cooperation. These impressive accomplishments, past and present, inspire our confidence in the future of cooperation. But the current crisis of mul-tilateralism exists not just because of the missed opportunities. Rather there are two sources of the current malaise. First, the institutions set up in 1945 to manage interstate affairs are straining to adapt to the evolu-tion of a global market, to the demands posed by technological change, to the substantial interconnections between their separate spheres of responsibility or to public and political skepticism about their ability to perform. Second, efforts to adapt those institutions have been stymied because governments have failed to address the underlying issue&#8212;the changing distribution of power and the widening sphere of responsi-bility at the international level&#8212;and because the major powers have at </span></div></body></html>
