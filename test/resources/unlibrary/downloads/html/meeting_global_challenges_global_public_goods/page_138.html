New tracking methods can build on these examples. Once such a line item is established in the OECD statistics, a &#8220;league table&#8221; (a ranking report) of spending on global public goods could be compiled. This would be helpful in gen-erating domestic support for global public goods spending. Global public goods spending should also be among the metrics used to shape participation in a Global 25 forum.Given the nature of global public goods, it is important in this context that the OECD elaborates its mechanisms for cooperation within the con-text of their growing cooperation with the major developing economies, who are increasingly important contributors to global public goods. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="217.6" top="423.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="423.65" x1="217.6" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 67.73; y0: 423.65; y1: 433.65; width: 10.63; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Work with the private sector and markets</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.7" top="395.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="395.65" x1="337.7" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.5; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 7.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Governments should also do more to tap the energy and initiative of the private sector (including civil society) and markets and to take advantage of the specialized knowledge they can bring to bear, as discussed ear-lier in this chapter. Examples include recent developments in emission permit trading and advance market commitments. We envisage market- based approaches being expanded to address other global issues, in par-ticular in the areas of health, environment and knowledge. Governments should provide the necessary regulatory frameworks and incentives.</span></div><div left="57.1" right="229.6" top="269.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="269.65" x1="229.6" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.29; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 7.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Adopt innovative arrangements for financing</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.69" top="241.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="241.65" x1="337.69" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 67.1; y0: 241.65; y1: 251.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">While national governments remain primarily responsible for financing global public goods, this does not imply being restricted to conventional tools for public finance. In recent years there have been ever increasing calls for new and innovative sources of financing, sources that go beyond traditional assistance from donor governments&#8217; aid budgets. International taxes, charges for the use of global commons, frontloading of aid com-mitments and issuance of special drawing rights have all been grouped under this broad rubric. The purpose of these new sources would pri-marily be social development and poverty eradication, but many are also being advanced against the background of a growing need for continu- ous and predictable financial flows for global public goods purposes.Some of the emerging ideas are politically controversial. Many are concerned that these tools would put resources at the disposal of un-</span></div></body></html>
