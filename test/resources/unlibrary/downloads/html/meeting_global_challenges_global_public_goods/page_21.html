We insist on the urgency of the adoption by the Security Council and endorsement by the General Assembly of five key principles of legitimacy for the use of force ap-plied in conformity with the charter of the United Nations: seriousness of threat; proper purpose; last resort; proportional means; and balance of consequences.</span><span x0="147.79" y0="311.65" x1="240.62" style="x0: 147.79; x1: 155.81; y0: 311.65; y1: 321.65; width: 8.02; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Generating knowledge. </span><span x0="241.19" y0="311.65" x1="413.4" style="x0: 241.19; x1: 248.17; y0: 311.65; y1: 321.65; width: 6.98; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Knowledge is perhaps the clearest example of a public good. Once knowledge is generated it can be shared, in principle, by many people at the same time and it is hard for creators of knowledge to maintain exclusive property of it. Hence, if left to market forces alone, there would always be a tendency to underinvest in the generation of knowledge. Knowledge is not only a national public good but a global public good as well, because its diffusion is not stopped by borders. People in any nation could in principle benefit from scientific or technological knowledge produced in other nations. Knowledge is by itself critical for development, at the same time as it serves as an input to the provision of other global public goods. The spontaneous globalization of knowledge does not occur, however, largely because many countries, due to deficiencies in their educational systems, have limited capacity to assimilate existing and new knowledge. Another important barrier to spontaneous globalization is that knowledge has been made to some degree excludable by the adoption of intellectual property rights. The most important step taken recently to protect intel-lectual property rights has occurred on the multilateral front with the </span></div></body></html>
