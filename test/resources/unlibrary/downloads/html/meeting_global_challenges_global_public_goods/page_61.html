Effective vaccines against and treatments for diseases affecting people living in developing countries are chronically stalled because pharmaceutical companies lack incentives. Ideally the international community should have a fully function- ing surveillance system, effective treatment and a fluid supply of vac-cines (including development, production and distribution) to prevent the emergence and spread of the most deadly diseases. This would require sharply improved surveillance, prevention and treatment in all countries. Such efforts should also address the conditions that give rise to new diseases, including poor sanitation, hygiene, public health sys-tems, farming practices and communication networks. International standards would be introduced to facilitate coordination and establish benchmarks for investment. Research and development for vaccines would have to be ramped up, both regionally and globally, and then complemented by greater ca- pacity to develop, manufacture and distribute new treatments and vac-cines for emerging diseases. For this purpose, there would be a global preparedness plan that establishes rules for preparedness and provides incentives for distribution of treatment and vaccines to the places where they are needed the most.</span></div><div left="132.66" right="352.03" top="227.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="227.65" x1="352.03" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.85; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 7.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">An immediate strategy for controlling infectious diseases </span></div><div left="132.66" right="410.5" top="199.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="199.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.43; y0: 199.65; y1: 209.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The current situation is far from optimal, but we can begin to move to-ward this goal. Indeed much is under way already. An immediate strategy to control infectious diseases would entail the following three elements: improving the global preparedness-to-response chain, strengthening the capacity of public health systems to prevent and treat infectious diseases and increasing knowledge for vaccines and treatment.</span><span x0="343.82" y0="133.96" x1="349.53" style="x0: 343.82; x1: 346.68; y0: 133.96; y1: 139.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">30</span></div><div left="147.66" right="257.78" top="115.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="115.65" x1="257.78" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 153.29; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 5.63; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">From preparedness to response. </span><span x0="256.03" y0="115.65" x1="413.25" style="x0: 256.03; x1: 262.8; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">To control the emergence and spread of a disease requires preparedness, prevention and treatment, surveillance, reporting and response. </span><span x0="147.66" y0="72.72" x1="157.21" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 72.72; y1: 86.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="73.65" x1="217.88" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 174.29; y0: 73.65; y1: 83.65; width: 5.63; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Preparedness. </span><span x0="216.89" y0="73.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 216.89; x1: 223.66; y0: 73.65; y1: 83.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">A first step would be to create mechanisms for ef-</span></div></body></html>
