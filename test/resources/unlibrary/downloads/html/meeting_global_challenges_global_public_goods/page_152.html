Established under a 1953 treaty, CERN was a way to achieve high-energy physics on a scale that no country could achieve individually. The CERN has been constructing and operating particle accelerators since 1954 and is currently building a large hadron collider (LHC). The par-ticle collider must be built to a precise specification, and its construction requires a particular level of expenditure. If a little less is spent on the project, the specification will not be met, and the desired experiments cannot be carried out. It was thus critical to secure financial partner-</span></div></body></html>
