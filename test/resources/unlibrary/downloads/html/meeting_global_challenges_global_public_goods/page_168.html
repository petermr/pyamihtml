Thus complementary, international as well as regional cooperation is required in order to produce locally desired de-velopment outcomes. Recognizing these interdependencies, Sweden and France have taken the initiative to establish an international task force with a mandate to foster an enhanced provision of international public goods, global and regional, which are of critical importance for eliminating pov- erty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In an in-terdependent world, extreme poverty and its manifold consequences are of concern to all; and it is thus in the enlightened self-interest of all to ensure a life in dignity for all. It is in our common interest to secure sustainable development in all its dimensions&#8212;environmental, social and economic.</span></div><div left="57.1" right="115.26" top="297.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="297.8" x1="115.26" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.14; y0: 297.8; y1: 307.8; width: 7.04; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Background</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.72" top="269.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="269.65" x1="337.72" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 67.1; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">While the notion of international public goods is gaining widespread recognition in the international development debates, the concept is met with circumspection and reservation, calling for further clarifica- tion and discussions. The notion refers to issues of global concern&#8212;common concerns of all&#8212;and voices have been raised suggesting the initiation of a participatory process in order to gain a better understand- ing of the analytical as well as practical-political relevance of the con-cept and how it can be translated into concrete policy actions. It is in this light that a temporary International Task Force (ITF), which would work in a highly consultative manner, has been established.</span></div><div left="57.1" right="102.29" top="101.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="101.8" x1="102.29" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.88; y0: 101.8; y1: 111.8; width: 7.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Objective</span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="73.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="73.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 73.65; y1: 83.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The ITF shall conduct its analyses and make its recommendations, act-</span></div><div left="57.1" right="251.5" top="539.87"><span x0="57.1" y0="539.87" x1="251.5" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 69.32; y0: 539.87; y1: 559.87; width: 12.22; font-size: 20.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Terms of Reference</span><span x0="355.27" y0="526.16" x1="385.29" style="x0: 355.27; x1: 385.29; y0: 526.16; y1: 580.16; width: 30.02; font-size: 54.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">1</span></div></body></html>
