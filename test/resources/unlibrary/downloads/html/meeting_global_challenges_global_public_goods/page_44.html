The concept of global public goods provides a powerful framework to rediscover both classical and contemporary arguments for international cooperation, to generate innovation and to identify pathways to overcoming some of the obstacles governments confront in tackling global ills.</span><span x0="140.97" y0="483.96" x1="146.69" style="x0: 140.97; x1: 143.83; y0: 483.96; y1: 489.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">18</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.73" top="465.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="465.65" x1="337.73" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 75.43; y0: 465.65; y1: 475.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">In the sphere of global public goods, international cooperation is in the national interests of all, as well as in the common interest.</span><span x0="288.83" y0="455.96" x1="294.51" style="x0: 288.83; x1: 291.68; y0: 455.96; y1: 461.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">19</span><span x0="296.63" y0="451.65" x1="337.71" style="x0: 296.63; x1: 304.86; y0: 451.65; y1: 461.65; width: 8.23; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Of course the national interest is not achieved without negotiation and compro-mise. Just as in the national sphere each citizen must make sacrifices&#8212;in the form of taxes, regulations and some restrictions on individual lib- erty&#8212;to realize the benefits of security and freedom, so at the inter-national level all states have national interests in making the necessary short-term sacrifices, and exercising the necessary restraint, to enable the long-term rewards and benefits that only international cooperation can provide. The concept helps us recognize that, with a long-term view and with concerted action, the global interest and the national interest can not only be reconciled but are mutually reinforcing. This provides a compelling framework to use in national settings to persuade domestic audiences and authorities of the value of commit- ting national resources, and restraining national autonomy, in the pur-suit of common international goals. Whereas funding for development is framed either in terms of altruism or geo-politics, it is important to remind national audiences of three simple realities: </span><span x0="72.1" y0="212.72" x1="81.71" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.05; y0: 212.72; y1: 226.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="93.1" y0="213.65" x1="328.93" style="x0: 93.1; x1: 99.87; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">All peoples will be affected by changes in the environment. </span><span x0="72.1" y0="198.72" x1="81.71" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.05; y0: 198.72; y1: 212.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="93.1" y0="199.65" x1="321.67" style="x0: 93.1; x1: 99.87; y0: 199.65; y1: 209.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">All peoples are vulnerable to risks from infectious disease. </span><span x0="72.1" y0="184.72" x1="81.78" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.05; y0: 184.72; y1: 198.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="93.1" y0="185.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 93.1; x1: 99.87; y0: 185.65; y1: 195.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">All can benefit from international systems designed to sup-ply peace and security, trade and financial stability&#8212;and the prosperity that these allow. Moreover the features of global public goods transcend tradi- tional divisions between states. Supplying global public goods re-quires efforts by many or all states, and all states can share in their benefits. This broadens our conception of states&#8217; responsibilities to one another, of the mutual responsibilities all states bear to ensure that their national actions contribute to and reinforce both the na-</span></div></body></html>
