Historically it has proven necessary for one or several countries with an enlightened vision and clear sense of responsibility to ignite the processes conducive to the solution of problems that may affect all of humanity.The question is: it is up to whom to play this role in our time? We submit that it is up to the countries that are relatively more prosperous, with larger populations, bigger defence and security capabilities, that have been historically influential and that, typically, have benefited the most from the rule-based multilateral system. These countries have a special responsibility to catalyse action for improving the provision of global public goods. These countries have the responsibility to move first towards goals for the good of everyone, putting forward initiatives for enhancing cooperation and committing resources for their effective realization. And when this happens, international leadership emerges, not as an imposition, but as a natural result of the assumption of responsibil-ity. With this type of leadership countries can stimulate change and use their position to persuade others to participate in common endeavours to advance global goods or tackle global ills.The difficulties involved in cooperating to provide global public goods can be overcome when three critical factors are present: first, the catalytic leadership and action described above; second, effective institu- tions for the delivery; and third, adequate and appropriate financing.</span></div><div left="57.1" right="187.96" top="241.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="241.8" x1="187.96" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.77; y0: 241.8; y1: 251.8; width: 6.67; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Priority global public goods</span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="213.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="213.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">To illustrate the importance of generating greater provision of global pub-lic goods, we have focused on six whose provision is critical: preventing the emergence and spread of infectious disease; tackling climate change; enhancing international financial stability; strengthening the international trading system; achieving peace and security, which underlies and is es- sential to all the others; and the cross-cutting issue of knowledge.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="129.65" x1="296.32" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.45; y0: 129.65; y1: 139.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Preventing the emergence and spread of infectious disease. </span><span x0="296.07" y0="129.65" x1="337.71" style="x0: 296.07; x1: 299.4; y0: 129.65; y1: 139.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Infectious diseases have the potential to threaten the health of every person and the prosperity of every nation.
