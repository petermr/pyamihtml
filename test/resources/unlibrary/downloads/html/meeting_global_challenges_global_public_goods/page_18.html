The system has permitted greater protectionism in products of sig- nificant export interest for developing countries. The provisions allow-ing for special and differential treatment for these countries, and the trade preferences granted by developed countries do not compensate in any meaningful way for the trading opportunities missed as a conse- quence of the remaining protectionism. Objectively, the system is un- balanced against the interests of developing countries.Balancing the system to make it more supportive of developing countries&#8217; development was a core objective of the Doha Round&#8212; dubbed for this reason the development agenda&#8212;launched in Novem-ber of 2001. But this sense of purpose was short-lived. In fact, a total suspension of the negotiations for lack of agreement on any of the im-portant issues occurred in July 2006. The main reason for the Doha breakdown is to be found in the agriculture negotiations. The majority of developed countries have re- sisted effective liberalization in farm trade all along. Years of negotia-tions could not make these countries agree on formulas that would effectively open their farm markets to imports and significantly reduce their most distorting farm subsidies. In fact what was brought to the table even up to the very collapse of the talks would have accomplished little to open up agricultural markets and to temper the huge distor-tions caused in those markets by the high subsidies granted by OECD countries to their farmers. The cost of failure in the Doha Round is not only the income op-portunities forgone for both developed and developing countries that its successful conclusion would provide, but more importantly the losses that all will incur if the system is allowed to deteriorate and eventually proves incapable of preventing countries from back-pedaling into protection-ism, as has happened before in history. Despite its achievements, the multilateral trading system is not yet a consolidated global public good. It remains vulnerable to serious erosion by episodes of protectionism. It also has limited capacity to support the integration into the world economy of many countries which have been left on the sidelines of globalization despite formally belonging to the World Trade Organiza- tion (WTO).This Task Force endorses the full resumption of the Doha Round </span></div></body></html>
