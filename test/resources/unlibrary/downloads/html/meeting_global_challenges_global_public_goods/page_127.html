Finally, we repeat our argument that broader use of carbon taxes would in addition to reduc-ing carbon emissions generate significant new resources that could help finance global public goods. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="406.69" top="493.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="493.8" x1="406.69" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 142.1; y0: 493.8; y1: 503.8; width: 9.44; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Why? Major returns from financing of global public goods</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.38" top="465.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="465.65" x1="413.38" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.26; y0: 465.65; y1: 475.65; width: 7.6; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Despite recent positive developments in international financial flows, the amount of available resources is not keeping up with the emerging global challenges. The High-Level Panel on Financing for Development estimated in 2001 that some $20 billion a year was required to begin to address the need for global public goods&#8212;four times the spending level at the time.</span><span x0="196.25" y0="399.96" x1="204.79" style="x0: 196.25; x1: 199.1; y0: 399.96; y1: 405.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">117</span><span x0="205.73" y0="395.65" x1="413.22" style="x0: 205.73; x1: 212.5; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Though that estimate was rough and certainly on the low side, there is little doubt that further expenditure on global public goods will be needed. As governments begin to devote more resources to global public goods, some are concerned that this will draw spending away from tra-ditional development assistance. Official development assistance and the financing of global public goods are not the same, but they interact in several ways.</span><span x0="363.34" y0="301.96" x1="371.91" style="x0: 363.34; x1: 366.19; y0: 301.96; y1: 307.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">118</span><span x0="375.46" y0="297.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 375.46; x1: 380.77; y0: 297.65; y1: 307.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">First, the purposes of the funding often coincide. Second, each can either supple-ment or crowd out the other. Third, providing global public goods can enhance or reduce the effectiveness of aid, and vice versa. The fight against avian flu and other infectious diseases illustrates this particularly well. Surveillance of the disease, research for a vaccine and more effective treatments are global public goods. But the effec-tiveness of surveillance and the distribution of vaccines and treatments ultimately depend on the capacity of the health sector of developing countries, including trained personnel and basic infrastructure. Building such capacity is an important component of development programmes. Therefore, capacity building&#8212;what is traditionally considered an ele-ment of development assistance&#8212;is also a vital ingredient of supplying a global public good.Consequently the financing of certain aspects of global public goods often comes from donor countries&#8217; development budgets&#8212;for example, in the areas of capacity building to control communicable </span></div></body></html>
