The Panel&#8217;s call for a new security consensus was widely embraced by governments and civil society organizations, but unfortunately only minimally adopted by the UN World Summit in 2005. In acting on the Panel&#8217;s recommendations, governments made some progress on some clusters of threats, but failed altogether on other issues. Most progress was made on strengthening the UN&#8217;s role for pre-venting and responding to internal conflict, genocide and large-scale human rights abuses. Against many expectations, the Summit strongly endorsed the concept of the responsibility to protect, recognizing that the international community has the responsibility to take col- lective action where national authorities are manifestly failing to pro-tect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. It also created a new Peacebuilding Commission to coordinate and sustain post-conflict reconstruction and endorsed the concept of a new Human Rights Council, which was brought into being by the General Assembly in April 2006. Less noticed but still significant were agreements at the Summit to strengthen the UN&#8217;s approach to tackling organized crime and re- lated transnational threats.But there were three areas of major disappointment in the World Summit outcomes on peace and security (quite apart from failing to even agree to a starting point for action on reform of the UN Security Council, an issue we address in Part III). First, the Summit failed to offer even a single sentence on the critical issues of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Second, although the Summit did unequivo-cally condemn terrorism&#8212;without any reservations, for the first time in the UN&#8217;s history&#8212;it neither endorsed a widely acclaimed coun-ter-terrorism strategy proposed by the Secretary-General, nor agreed to a definition of terrorism. Third, while the Summit reaffirmed the centrality of the UN Charter on issues relating to the use of force in the international community, it did not accept the Panel&#8217;s recommen-dations for more detailed criteria for the use of force, which had been designed to maximize the chances of reaching consensus when po-tentially highly divisive cases arose in the future as they have in recent years, nowhere more than in the case of Iraq.
