While the latter are so large as to be unwieldy, the G-8 is too small for its decisions to generate the kind of broad-based support required for acceptance and implementation through formal institutions. Moreover even when the G-8 takes a forward-leaning step on a rapidly evolving issue, as with the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) in the face of evidence of sea-based movement of nuclear and biological materials and related weapons systems, it does not engage in a wider process of negotiations, causing the PSI to be as much resented as embraced. And even within the G-8&#8217;s original field of focus, international finance, its limited membership is increasingly seen as anachronistic in the face of the changing distribution of wealth and financial influ-ence in the global market. Even measured in traditional gross domestic product (GDP) terms, China now has a larger GDP than two current members of the G-8 (Italy and Canada), and six countries not in-cluded in the G-8 have larger GDPs than Russia (Spain, whose GDP is also larger than Canada&#8217;s; India; the Republic of Korea; Mexico; Australia; and Brazil).</span><span x0="146.05" y0="371.96" x1="151.84" style="x0: 146.05; x1: 148.91; y0: 371.96; y1: 377.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">97</span><span x0="155.84" y0="367.65" x1="337.83" style="x0: 155.84; x1: 165.01; y0: 367.65; y1: 377.65; width: 9.17; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Moreover, looked at in terms of the World Bank&#8217;s preferred tool for measuring wealth and well-being, purchasing power parity, the GDP of China and India combined almost equals the GDP of Japan, the UK, France, Italy, Canada and Germany com- bined.</span><span x0="82.61" y0="315.96" x1="88.38" style="x0: 82.61; x1: 85.46; y0: 315.96; y1: 321.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">98</span><span x0="90.98" y0="311.65" x1="337.8" style="x0: 90.98; x1: 100.98; y0: 311.65; y1: 321.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">When looked at in terms of international financial activity, China&#8217;s exclusion from the G-8 is fundamentally at odds with its major role in international finance and trade. The non-participation of the major developing economies in G-8 deliberations and the absence of a broader consultative process (ad- dressed only in a very partial and often resented way by the recent in-vitation of some outside states to sit in on part of the summit process) sharply limit the potential for the G-8 to perform the catalytic function needed to enhance the supply of global public goods. Indeed the G-8 created a wider forum, the G-20 finance ministers gathering (see box 8.1), when it saw that its efforts were being largely ignored by the major emerging economies, states whose participation in solutions was essential for their success and whose compliance could no longer be taken for granted.</span><span x0="182.5" y0="133.96" x1="188.24" style="x0: 182.5; x1: 185.35; y0: 133.96; y1: 139.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">99</span></div><div left="57.22" right="227.74" top="101.65"><span x0="57.22" y0="101.65" x1="227.74" style="x0: 57.22; x1: 64.2; y0: 101.65; y1: 111.65; width: 6.98; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Transforming the G-20: A Global 25 forum</span></div><div left="57.22" right="335.05" top="73.65"><span x0="57.22" y0="73.65" x1="335.05" style="x0: 57.22; x1: 67.22; y0: 73.65; y1: 83.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">With institutional summits generally unwieldy and the G-8 too exclu-</span></div></body></html>
