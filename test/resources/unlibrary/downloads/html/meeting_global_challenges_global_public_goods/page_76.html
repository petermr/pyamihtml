We disagree. There are risks other than emerging market uncertainty in the interna-tional financial system&#8212;not least, the current account imbalances that loom over the international economy, the risks associated with under-supervision of derivatives and the intervention of large-scale hedge funds into international capital market. We see the current moment of calm as a time for preparedness not complacency&#8212;an important op-portunity to take the necessary policy and financial steps to ensure that the IMF is well prepared to take on future crises, with all the necessary safeguards against moral hazard. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="278.75" top="339.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="339.8" x1="278.75" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.59; y0: 339.8; y1: 349.8; width: 6.49; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Strengthening the international trading system</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.83" top="311.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="311.65" x1="337.83" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 62.0; y0: 311.65; y1: 321.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Since the inception of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, a process to build a rule-based multilateral trading system has been taking place (see figure 5.1). This system, which some-times has proceeded by big strides and at others with only little steps, on balance has been an impressive achievement. The overwhelming trade barriers that existed in the industrialized countries at the end of the Second World War&#8212;and those that were later erected in many de-veloping countries as a result of their import substitution policies&#8212;have now been greatly diminished, if not totally eliminated. Thanks to its progressive liberalization, a task undoubtedly facilitated by the multilat-eral system, trade has been a chief engine of global economic growth for well over half a century. Mainly by virtue of the principles of most-favoured-nation treat-ment and national treatment&#8212;enshrined respectively in Articles I and III of the GATT&#8212;the multilateral trading system tends to be a global public good.</span><span x0="107.11" y0="105.96" x1="112.82" style="x0: 107.11; x1: 109.96; y0: 105.96; y1: 111.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">78</span><span x0="115.79" y0="101.65" x1="337.7" style="x0: 115.79; x1: 121.1; y0: 101.65; y1: 111.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Formally, the system&#8217;s availability to any one member is not at the expense of that of any other member.
