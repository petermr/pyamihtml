Too much of the international sphere is taken up with interventions that have at best a tenuous basis for the connection between the intervention and the nature of the problem. And far too little is done to develop and apply cost-benefit analysis to interventions. Evidence of a connection between the problem and the designed solution and cost-benefit analysis are both useful in convincing sceptical publics, parliaments and paymas-ters to provide the necessary investments in global public goods. The lack of adequate research into causal relationships bedevils pol-icy development on terrorism prevention, on post-conflict economic aid and other major spheres of international cooperation. The research that emanates from international institutions in their own issue areas is often methodologically weak or politically shaped; much could be done to im-prove the independence and rigour of research within institutions. The governing boards of international institutions should promote indepen-dent peer review and related tools to enhance the quality of and reliability of in-house research. And foundation and government sponsors of inde-pendent research should encourage deeper work on these questions. One problem is the lack of research and data; the other is sourcing. In the context of national and international debates about whether to support new investments in global public goods, vested interests that stand to lose from the enhanced provision of a particular global public good (such as reduced tariff protection) may exaggerate the costs and minimize the benefits to the country. To counterbalance such sources of misinformation, it is essential that credible independent information and analysis be available to inform public debate. One important source of information can come from the research departments of selected global and regional institutions, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The value and influence of such work would be stronger were such departments to develop a joint or well coordinated research programme </span></div></body></html>
