With evidence-based research into global public goods issues, more consistent monitoring of state compliance and credible, consistent eval-uation of institutional performance, governments and publics would have a substantial basis for weighing the merits of investments and en-suring accountability for them. A consolidated set of such reports could be provided to the Global 25 forum, providing it with a solid eviden-tiary basis for debate and action. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="252.03" top="465.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="465.65" x1="252.03" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.89; y0: 465.65; y1: 475.65; width: 8.23; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Other aspects of accountability</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.23" top="437.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="437.65" x1="413.23" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 138.6; y0: 437.65; y1: 447.65; width: 5.94; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Evidence, monitoring and evaluation are essential parts of a strategy to enhance transparency. So too are reforms to ensure greater transparency in the selection of the heads of international institutions. We commend the UN Secretary-General for his recent efforts to make the selection of senior officials more transparent and urge other institutions to adopt similar reforms. If greater transparency is to have its desired effect, two changes will be needed. First, regional and international institutions must be adapted to provide penalties for non-compliance; transparency mechanisms will have most effect if linked to mechanisms to enforce international agree-ments. Second, national governments must be held more effectively to account for their fulfilment of international commitments. At the international level, our report in Part II proposed a number of specific measures to strengthen the role of international mechanism in ensuring state compliance. As for the necessary work at the national level, it is beyond the role of this Task Force to propose necessary reforms to domestic system to engender greater accountability for governments&#8217; fulfilment of their in- ternational commitments. Such reforms must of necessity arise from do-mestic action. Here civil society has a critical role to play. In a compelling recent example the Ford Foundation has helped to establish TrustAfrica, an initiative designed to generate from within African countries the de- mand for action against violence, corruption and similar ills. Among in-ternational NGOs, organizations like Oxfam, Transparency International and Amnesty International have been leaders in promoting domestic ac-countability for international action. There is no substitute for domestic, civic action to generate real accountability of this kind. </span></div></body></html>
