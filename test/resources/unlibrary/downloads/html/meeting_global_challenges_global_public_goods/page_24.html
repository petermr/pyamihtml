With regard to the IMF, and in line with the IMF Managing Director&#8217;s strategy, more weight should be given to the most underrepresented countries in the governance of the IMF to better reflect the changing struc-ture of the world economy. In the World Bank, developing countries should be more fully represented on its board. The almost identical composition of the IMF and World Bank boards is outdated and should be replaced by boards whose composition better represents the interests of the key stakeholders and the mandates of the respec-tive organizations. The UN Security Council&#8217;s ability to maintain international peace and security would be strengthened by reforms to its membership and abolition of the veto. If this ideal reform cannot be attained, an interim strategy is to add elected, but renewable, seats to the Security Council, open primarily to the states within regional groupings that make the largest financial, military and political commitments to the UN&#8212;the &#8220;Option B&#8221; proposed by the UN High-Level Panel on Threats, Chal-lenges and Change. We also call for three additional reforms to increase the accountabil-ity and effectiveness of international institutions: improved data on the costs and benefits of global public goods, better monitoring of compli-ance with international obligations and independent evaluation of the performance of international institutions. Enhanced support to and use of evidence-based research is an essen-tial step for more effective management of global issues. One important source is the research departments of specialized agencies. The value of their work would be stronger were such agencies to develop a well co-ordinated research programme focused on the costs and benefits&#8212;and distributional impacts&#8212;of global public goods. OECD can play an im-portant role in this regard. Institutional research should be supplemented by independent scholarly research and assessment.Governments and the private sector should sponsor independent research capacity and the de-velopment of research networks on global public goods. More consistent monitoring of state compliance with international obligations is a second necessary reform. In international negotiations gov- ernments should encourage the adoption of formal&#8212;or, if necessary, infor- mal&#8212;monitoring mechanisms to accompany international agreements. Better, more consistent and more independent evaluation of insti- tutional performance would also enhance the accountability of institu-</span></div></body></html>
