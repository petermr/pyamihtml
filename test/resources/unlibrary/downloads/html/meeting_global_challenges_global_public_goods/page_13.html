Although states and their private sectors have different interests and stakes in the international financial system, only the most obstinate of governments fail to recognize that financial shocks are deleterious to all. In the absence of the international trade regime the global economy would sharply contract, and most economies and most people&#8217;s livelihoods would suffer as a result. Perhaps most importantly, all states and populations will lose if there is a further erosion of international peace and security. More positively, investment in global public goods can propel efforts to achieve key development goals. As an example, financial stability is critical to achieving broader economic development. Similarly, improv- ing the international trading system to bring it closer to an actual most-favoured-nation mechanism, eliminating harmful tariffs and subsidies including on agricultural products, will bring substantial development benefits. Of course the achievement of peace and security underlies de-velopment just as development underlies international security. It was for the purpose of elucidating the concept of global public goods, and proposing ways to improve their provision, that this Task Force was created. Our report explains the concept of global public goods using historical evidence; illustrates their importance by high- lighting six priority global issues where their provision is critical; sug-gests broad strategies in those areas for more effectively providing the good in question; and makes more specific recommendations for the kind of structural changes needed at national and international levels. Our report concentrates on the specific challenges posed by the need for international cooperation. This does not negate a recognition that the national level is critical in the provision of global public goods. Indeed we stress the principle of subsidiarity&#8212;solving problems closest to where they occur. But the most enduring difficulties in providing global public goods are found at the international level, and it is at this level that we have been mandated to focus our analysis. At the local and national level the provision of public goods is typi-cally organized by the state, with authority to tax, regulate and even coerce to ensure such provision. At the global level there is no institution with equivalent powers. For good reasons, there is no world government with the authority to tax, to conscript, to regulate or to quarantine. Therefore, at the international level, action to initiate the provision of a public good </span></div></body></html>
