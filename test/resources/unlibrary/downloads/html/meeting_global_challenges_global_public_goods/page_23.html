With appropriate links to existing formal institutions, such a forum could do much to spur action towards shared goals. And without such a forum&#8212;that marries inclusion and agility&#8212;it will be extremely hard to achieve the reforms to international policies, institutions and financing necessary to achieve common goals. But we cannot stress enough that such a catalytic forum must be matched to&#8212;indeed it must strengthen and make more effective&#8212;formal institutions and the wider process of negotiation and decision-making. This process is necessary to ensure that all states have a chance to ex-press their preferences and participate in the authorization, or rejection, of action, even if the direction is initially set by the Global 25. That the legitimacy of the decision-making mechanisms of the major international institutions is in doubt poses a major obstacle to this process, one requiring structural reform. We thus add our voices to those who have called for re-forming the mechanisms and representation of the UN Security Council and the governing bodies of the IMF and the World Bank, as well as the broader UN system&#8212;reflecting its dual roles in promoting development and managing global issues.The effectiveness of international mechanisms needs also to be enhanced through improved accountability, starting with greater transparency. Such reforms will also aid national mobilization and resource commitments. </span></div><div left="132.79" right="336.0" top="241.65"><span x0="132.79" y0="241.65" x1="336.0" style="x0: 132.79; x1: 139.35; y0: 241.65; y1: 251.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Effective institutions: governance and accountability </span></div><div left="132.79" right="413.32" top="213.65"><span x0="132.79" y0="213.65" x1="413.32" style="x0: 132.79; x1: 136.12; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">In most cases, producing a global public good will require action by international institutions, including building on, reinforcing and often coordinating national action; channelling funds to national programs; monitoring and reporting on progress; and, in a growing number of issue areas, considering and implementing decisions taken at a global level. Thus the quality and the management of international institu-tional capacity are vital for the provision of global public goods. The greater concern is with the question of whether or not, systemically, international institutions have been suitably adapted to play an appro-priate role in the provision of global public goods. Of major concern is the need to improve the governance and en-</span></div></body></html>
