We also highlight the value of tightening the link between the governance mechanisms of regional bodies and their representation in international fora. When, as is sometimes the case, the country or coun-tries that sit in the leadership/chairmanship of regional bodies do not represent that region in international fora, political dynamics open gaps between the regional mechanism and its projection internationally. The EU has begun to bridge this gap through the presidency, but others such as the AU have not yet done so. Regionalism is not, however, an alternative to an overarching frame-work for political and economic cooperation at the international level. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="130.59" top="353.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="353.65" x1="130.59" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 65.12; y0: 353.65; y1: 363.65; width: 8.02; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Governance reform</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.66" top="325.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="325.65" x1="337.66" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">There is no real doubt that restoring public and political confidence in the major international institutions will require reform of their gover-nance mechanisms. But there is great debate over the specifics of those reforms and the principles that should guide them. In the past few years those debates have been clouded by loose ter- minology and confused terms. Frequent recourse is made to the con-cept of &#8220;democratizing&#8221; governance but without a shared concept of democracy or its application to international institutions. The term &#8220;ef-ficiency&#8221; is also used, but in widely differing ways by states seeking to further their national claims. So is the concept of &#8220;changed distribution of power&#8221;, used to argue both for broadening the participation of ris-ing powers and for narrowing it to the hyper-powerful. And all of these terms have been used at times to promote reforms that do little more than reward stature, rather than encourage commitment. Still there is no getting around the great deal of disquiet within a wide range of constituencies about current governance arrangements&#8212;dis- quiet that impedes reform agendas and the core work of the major in-ternational institutions, whether it is widespread skepticism of Security Council decision-making surrounding questions of terrorism and nuclear </span></div></body></html>
