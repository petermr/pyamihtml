They are tools for consolidation more than for setting new agendas, and, as a result, often do not enable catalytic action. International summits also tend to reinforce rather than transcend the regional and political groupings for business-as-usual in international institutions. And they operate within the sector-by-sector architecture of the existing system, ignoring or underplaying the intersections and interconnections between issues. Institutional summits will undoubtedly remain a part of the inter-national landscape and will under some circumstances be able to reach agreements on well developed topics. But for catalytic action to jump-start the more effective, more reliable supply of global public goods, more nimble and more political mechanisms are needed. </span><span x0="147.66" y0="423.65" x1="289.2" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 153.29; y0: 423.65; y1: 433.65; width: 5.63; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Political summits: the G-8 and others. </span><span x0="288.82" y0="423.65" x1="413.18" style="x0: 288.82; x1: 298.82; y0: 423.65; y1: 433.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">When formal institutions have been unable to act, international political fora that bring together clusters of national leaders outside formal frameworks have at times filled gaps on an interim basis or catalysed action by taking steps critical to attract the willingness of others to engage and cooperate or to commit resources. There are a myriad of regional and subregional summit fora, as well as summits of political or religious groupings. The best known, and prob-ably the most significant example, is the G-8. Over its history, the G-8 has shown at least an episodic capacity to move issues forward that have been otherwise immobilized within formal institutions. Recent examples include the political agreement on Kosovo (1999),</span><span x0="335.87" y0="287.96" x1="341.54" style="x0: 335.87; x1: 338.72; y0: 287.96; y1: 293.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">96</span><span x0="345.46" y0="283.65" x1="413.31" style="x0: 345.46; x1: 352.86; y0: 283.65; y1: 293.65; width: 7.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">which had been blocked in the UN and in the Organization for Security and Co-opera-tion in Europe (OSCE), and debt relief for Africa (2005), which had been stuck in the international financial institutions. The G-8 has also launched initiatives that would have been com-plicated to negotiate in a wider institutional framework, required more than a bilateral political framework, and yet benefited far more coun-tries than participated in the launch of the initiative&#8212;such as the G-8&#8217;s Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction in 2002. Through this mechanism the G-8 countries used their considerable financial capacity to pay for the clean-up of the former Soviet Union&#8217;s nuclear stockpiles&#8212;a global good, surely. Another example is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria that was initiated by the G-8 in 2001.Regional groupings most often affect regional action; while the regional level is important, it does not suffice for global action.
