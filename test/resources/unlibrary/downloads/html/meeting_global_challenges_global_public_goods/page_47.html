Historically the easiest global pub-lic goods to produce are &#8220;best-shot&#8221; public goods&#8212;goods that simply have to be supplied once for them to be available to all. The discovery of a vaccine is such a good; once discovered it potentially can be avail-able to all in perpetuity. Similarly, it has been argued that the United States, acting in its own right and in its own interest, created important best-shot global public goods by securing international air and sea lanes, maintaining a strong currency used widely as a standard, acting as the basic financial regulator and serving as the lender of last resort.</span><span x0="323.46" y0="455.96" x1="329.18" style="x0: 323.46; x1: 326.32; y0: 455.96; y1: 461.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">20</span><span x0="332.16" y0="451.65" x1="413.26" style="x0: 332.16; x1: 335.49; y0: 451.65; y1: 461.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">It is worth stressing, however, that the United States played this role in the context of a broad international consensus that it helped to forge, a consensus embedded in the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank&#8212;institutions within which the United States also agreed to constrain its own power. Consensus and constraint were important conditions for leadership. In most cases action by a single government will not suffice for the provision of global public goods, and broad regional or international cooperation is the only recourse. In these cases overcoming political and value differences forms a second kind of obstacle. Achieving some form of international agreement or consensus is an important part of providing global public goods. Thus we can by and large describe global public goods both in their economic sense and with the understanding that, for the most part, the large majority of states&#8212;as well as national private and civic actors&#8212;will see positive value in their production and consumption. But it is im-portant not to neglect the reality that some of these are contested. The question of how states and populations participate in decision-making or consensus building around the provision of global public goods is critical. The perceived value of a good will depend substantially on the quality and character of states&#8217; participation in the decision to supply it. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="315.23" top="115.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="115.8" x1="315.23" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.44; y0: 115.8; y1: 125.8; width: 7.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Overcoming obstacles to cooperation </span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.25" top="87.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="87.65" x1="413.25" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.43; y0: 87.65; y1: 97.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The difficulties in providing global public goods point to one of the major obstacles to their provision: cooperation at the international level </span></div></body></html>
