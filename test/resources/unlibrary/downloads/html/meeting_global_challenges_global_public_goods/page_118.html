The Security Council&#8217;s ability to maintain international peace and security would be strengthened by reforms to its membership and to the veto. The ability of any one of the Permanent 5 to veto UN action has from the outset been a source of contention, has undermined po-litical support for the organization and has in any case largely failed to forestall the use of force outside the framework of the Charter.</span><span x0="309.44" y0="497.96" x1="318.01" style="x0: 309.44; x1: 312.3; y0: 497.96; y1: 503.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">108</span><span x0="321.28" y0="493.65" x1="337.71" style="x0: 321.28; x1: 326.59; y0: 493.65; y1: 503.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">For the veto two alternatives can be considered. One is replacing the veto by a system of weighted voting, which would still provide reassurance to the most powerful but would broaden real participation by elected members in the Security Council&#8217;s decision-making. Somewhat more realistically (since it does not involve having a permanent member agree to give up their veto per se), a second option is instituting a system of double vetoes&#8212;a system that would require at least two veto-holding members to vote negatively to block a Security Council decision&#8212;for instances when the Security Council faces issues most damaging to international peace and security, especially crimes against humanity.It is worth noting that had such a mechanism been in place, the Secu-rity Council would likely have voted in a timely way to take action in Kosovo and Darfur.  If such reform to the veto is not possible, which regrettably seems to be the case at this time, membership reform should not add to the problem by bringing in new veto-wielding members; this would only further limit the Security Council&#8217;s ability to act. An interim option is to add elected, but renewable, seats to the Security Council, open primar- ily to the states within regional groupings that make the largest finan-cial, military and political commitments to the UN&#8212;the &#8220;Option B&#8221; proposed by the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Efforts to promote &#8220;Option A&#8221;&#8212;new permanent seats&#8212;ran aground at the UN in 2005 and generated significant political divisions within the membership. Option B has two advantages. First, it links representation within institutional governance structures to the engagement and commit-ment of states&#8212;a point that can assist in making the case to domestic constituencies for sustaining engagement at the global level. It can fur-ther aid the legitimacy of the Security Council by making it evident that the body reflects action by states that have taken responsibility and </span></div></body></html>
