In total, augmentation of the membership should bring it to a maxi-mum of 25 actors, hence, a Global 25.

First, there is a broad &#8220;summit fatigue&#8221; in the international system, which adds to resistance to proposals for a new one. Second, countries are typically reluctant to give up any existing summit forum in which they participate. Adding another summit forum would be unpopular for both reasons. A further political obstacle to a Global 25 forum lies in potential resistance from those who will not participate. While those who do not participate stand to gain from agreements and commitments made by a Global 25, the mere fact of non-inclusion tends to rankle national pride and create suspicion. But states that would resist the notion must answer the question, What is the alternative? Formal international institutions have repeatedly proven themselves too cumbersome, too narrowly bound to specific sec- tors, to solve global problems. And while the G-8 has performed impor-tant functions, its narrow membership sharply limits its potential. Without a grouping that marries inclusion with agility, it will be extremely hard to achieve the necessary reforms to international poli-cies, institutions and financing to achieve common goals. The best response to these concerns is to stress that the Global 25 would start as an informal forum. Only once it had proved its value should the questions be addressed of solidifying its forum (including such questions as whether it should have a Secretariat and the like) and resolving its relationship to the G-8 and G-20. A Global 25 forum, if established according to the criteria set here, could have a catalytic effect in the provision of global public goods. But a Global 25 forum can only be catalytic; it cannot be decisive. The broader community of states must have the ability to participate in nego-tiations about global public goods and to react to ideas and proposals from </span></div></body></html>
