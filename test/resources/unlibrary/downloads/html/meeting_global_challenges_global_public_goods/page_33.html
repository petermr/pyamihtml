We are convinced that only through the application of effective, ambitious international cooperation is it possible to reduce the risks in the global world and to realize its potential. Such solutions must also create the right incentives for private sector engagement. Civil society can sometimes lead the way, through innovation and through advo-cacy. But the primary responsibility remains with governments, both to take the necessary steps to ensure effective international coopera-tion, and to recognize the national interest&#8212;indeed, the vital national interest&#8212;to do so. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="327.07" top="423.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="423.8" x1="327.07" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 138.77; y0: 423.8; y1: 433.8; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">The benefits of international cooperation</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.23" top="395.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="395.65" x1="413.23" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.43; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">All is not unmitigated gloom&#8212;far from it. Even in this troubled period, important achievements have been attained. In the sphere of development, there has been some good news, including the unprecedented outpour-ing of contributions to the victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami. Also, in 2005 European Union (EU) member states made real moves to imple-ment the Monterrey consensus and reach the 0.7% target for development assistance.</span><span x0="169.76" y0="315.96" x1="172.61" style="x0: 169.76; x1: 172.61; y0: 315.96; y1: 321.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">4</span><span x0="174.83" y0="311.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 174.83; x1: 181.6; y0: 311.65; y1: 321.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">This was done in recognition of the fact that many govern-ments have taken the hard decisions and critical policy steps to enable the productive use of aid.</span><span x0="214.21" y0="287.96" x1="217.07" style="x0: 214.21; x1: 217.07; y0: 287.96; y1: 293.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">5</span></div><div left="147.66" right="239.07" top="269.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="269.65" x1="239.07" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.64; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 6.98; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">At the international level </span><span x0="239.03" y0="269.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 239.03; x1: 241.95; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 2.92; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">there are important areas of positive perfor-mance. The World Health Organization&#8217;s (WHO) impressive response to the outbreak of SARS in 2002&#8211;03 proved its capability and high- lighted the benefits of cooperation.

And when UN reform seemed most strained, the General Assembly came together to adopt a treaty against nuclear terrorism and to agree on establishing a Peacebuilding Commission.These recent positive accomplishments stand on the backs of the significant achievements of international cooperation in the postwar era.
