It may now be common-place (as the UN High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change  argued) to say that &#8220;development is the indispensable foundation for a collective security system&#8221;, and that there is growing recognition (in the words of the European Security Strategy) that &#8220;security is a precondition of development&#8221;. However, in practice, international negotiations all too often focus on specific problems rather than the links and the priorities among them. Even where economic, security and environmental issues are ad-dressed, they still tend to be treated as separate. There is often a sense that some issues have been included in international agreements to placate different audiences. Clauses on terrorism matter to the West, for example; those on development to the South. They are brought together not because they are interrelated, but as a trade-off between irreconcilable parties, highlighting rather than reducing diverging in- ternational interests.This can be counter-productive, for today&#8217;s challenges cannot be neatly categorized. Economic and environmental concerns foster a ris- ing demand for civilian nuclear power, but given the state of interna-tional controls this brings with it a growing risk of nuclear proliferation. Freer trade increases global prosperity, but the twentieth century dem- onstrated that the alternative of protectionism and unregulated com-petition for resources can undermine security structures. Combating infectious disease is warranted in its own right, but will also have posi-tive side-effects for security and trade. The idea of global public goods reflects such interdependence as a necessary factor in effectively addressing global challenges. In the do- mestic sphere, a competent government inevitably responds to differ-ing interests; farmers and city-dwellers inevitably have separate needs. </span></div></body></html>
