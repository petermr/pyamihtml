It is a tool for altruistic purposes, importantly so; and it serves geopolitical interests, certainly. But it is also a tool for states to align their long-term, enlightened national interests to achieve common goals. Some of these goals are &#8220;global public goods&#8221;. Technically, public goods are those that share two rare quali-ties&#8212;non-excludability and non-rivalry, in economists&#8217; jargon. This means, respectively, that when provided to one party, the public good is available to all, and consumption of the public good by one party does not reduce the amount available to the others to consume. Tra-ditional examples of national public goods include traffic control systems and national security&#8212;goods that benefit all citizens and na-tional private actors but that none could manage or supply on their own initiative. Public goods can be regional or global in character, as well as na-tional. There are many cross-border challenges that are more effectively dealt with at the regional or global rather than the national level. Clear examples of regional public goods are the provision of tsunami early-warning systems, the management of river basins and measures to deal with region-specific vulnerabilities created by regional openness&#8212;for example, cross-border transmission of human and animal diseases. The sphere of global public goods we are concerned with is delineated by issues that are broadly conceived as important to the international com-munity, that for the most part cannot or will not be adequately addressed by individual countries acting alone and that are defined through a broad international consensus or a legitimate process of decision-making.Global public goods are those whose benefits could in principle be consumed by the governments and peoples of all states. Examples include mechanisms for ensuring financial stability, the scientific knowledge in-volved in the discovery of a vaccine and international regulations for civil aviation and telecommunications. Once such global standards and systems are established, they are available to all states, and consumption of the good by one state or its people in no way reduces its availability to others. If all states and people can benefit from the provision of global pub-lic goods, it seems logical that they should be easy to supply and should be available in abundance. But the opposite is true. In fact the very na-ture of global public goods means that demand will tend to outweigh </span></div></body></html>
