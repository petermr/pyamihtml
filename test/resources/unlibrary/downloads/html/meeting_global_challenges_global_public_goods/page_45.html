Work on global public goods also takes us beyond the state, helpfully pointing to the private sector, including civil society, who are increas-ingly involved in shaping transborder interactions and to the positive benefits these actors can provide. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="374.84" top="409.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="409.8" x1="374.84" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 142.1; y0: 409.8; y1: 419.8; width: 9.44; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Why are many global public goods in short supply?</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.23" top="381.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="381.65" x1="413.23" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 135.99; y0: 381.65; y1: 391.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">If all states and peoples can benefit from the provision of global public goods, it seems logical that they should be easy to supply and should be available in abundance. But the opposite is true. In fact the very nature of global public goods means that demand will tend to outweigh supply. There are a number of reasons for this: </span><span x0="147.66" y0="310.72" x1="157.14" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 310.72; y1: 324.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="311.65" x1="212.56" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 173.97; y0: 311.65; y1: 321.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Sovereignty. </span><span x0="212.64" y0="311.65" x1="413.25" style="x0: 212.64; x1: 220.04; y0: 311.65; y1: 321.65; width: 7.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Governments (or their citizens) are often unwilling to limit or constrain sovereign decision-making, for example by accepting binding rules or international monitoring of their own compliance with agreements. This weakens the prospects for cooperation by adding a high degree of uncertainty to most international agreements, where reliability would be more pro- ductive. This basic problem underlies all the others.</span><span x0="147.66" y0="212.72" x1="157.35" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 212.72; y1: 226.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="213.65" x1="296.53" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 176.26; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 7.6; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Differing preferences and priorities. </span><span x0="296.91" y0="213.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 296.91; x1: 304.31; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 7.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Governments often have di-vergent short-term interests in specific solutions even where they share common long-term goals; and since more and more governments are elected for time-bound periods, short-term politics tend to outweigh long-term perspectives. Moreover even the long-term goals themselves may resonate differently for different governments. Climate change impacts differently on different countries, and in the short term some may even profit from changes to local climate. Similarly, to describe the trade regime as a global public good is correct in economic terms, but countries have different economic stakes in the sys-</span></div></body></html>
