See Andersson (2006).19. Martin Wolf (2004b) makes a similar point in his book when he says that &#8220;it is in the national interest of both states and their citizens to participate in international treaty-based regimes and institutions that deliver global public goods, including open markets, environmental protection, health and international security.&#8221; 20. See Mandelbaum (2005).21. Japan made a significant financial contribution to Interfet, as the Australian-led operation was known, and it is important to acknowl- edge also that the United States flexed its diplomatic and financial mus-cle to generate Indonesian acquiescence to the Australian and later the UN presence.22. Smaller states have also played such roles&#8212;as did, for example, Costa Rica in respect of biodiversity, setting aside nearly a third of its land mass as national parks and conservation areas and initiating public-private partnerships with bioprospecting industries to finance conservation, efforts which stood as examples and helped to shape the eventual conclusion of the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity. See Arce (2004). 23. See www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/.24. Some of the growing literature about global public goods refers to the &#8220;production path&#8221; for generating the supply of global public goods (see Kaul and others 2003). However, because the interaction between levels and actors involved in the supply of global public goods can occur in multiple different sequences, it is clarifying simply to set out the neces- sary factors whose presence is critical rather than attempting to over spec- ify the kinds of relationships between them that can generate supply.25. For example, some estimates show that when Thailand&#8217;s troubles with the bird flu became known, the resulting collapse in poultry ex-ports cost was well over $1 billion. </span><span x0="271.08" y0="171.65" x1="324.8" style="x0: 271.08; x1: 277.64; y0: 171.65; y1: 181.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">The Economist</span><span x0="324.8" y0="171.65" x1="393.76" style="x0: 324.8; x1: 327.4; y0: 171.65; y1: 181.65; width: 2.6; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">, 12 August 2006. 26.
