Others are concerned that so-called &#8220;global taxes&#8221; are a first step towards &#8220;world government&#8221;. Despite such critiques, the international instruments through which any global charge is levied remains under the supervi-sion of sovereign states. The international community has examined a whole range of ideas. Among them are a tax on foreign currency transactions (or Tobin Tax), collected on a national or market basis, covering a range of transactions to be defined (such as futures, swaps and other derivatives); the cre-ation of additional special drawing rights by the IMF for development purposes, with donor countries making their Special Drawing Right allocation available to developing countries; creation of a global lot-tery, operated through national state-operated and state-licensed lotteries with proceeds shared between national participants and an independent foundation established in conjunction with the UN; and global devel-opment bonds, a new asset class of debt security that mobilizes capital in a systematic manner on capital markets for the purpose of financing environmentally sustainable projects in developing countries. While many of these approaches offer interesting economic and po-litical benefits, we have chosen to focus on three alternative approaches, two of which have already reached some early stage of implementation. The airline ticket solidarity contribution and the International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFim) are the furthest developed of the new and innovative sources, while carbon taxes would probably deliver the highest return as it would have both a carbon-emission-reducing effect and raise new international finance.</span><span x0="147.66" y0="227.65" x1="299.81" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.22; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">The airline ticket solidarity contribution. </span><span x0="300.22" y0="227.65" x1="413.26" style="x0: 300.22; x1: 306.99; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Among the most advanced in this range of new ideas is the airline ticket solidarity contribution.

At the 60th Anniversary of the United Nations in New York in 2005, France proposed to create a financing scheme which would be based on a solidarity contribution levied on airline tickets.
