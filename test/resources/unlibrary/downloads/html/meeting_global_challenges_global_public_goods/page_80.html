Needless to say, the Doha Round fiasco does not stem from a fail- ure of the trade negotiators to do their job. These negotiators&#8217; capaci-ties can never exceed the mandate received from the governments they represent. It will be up to the highest levels of political leadership in those governments to do what it takes to complete adequately the Doha agenda. It makes little sense to go back to the negotiating table if the ac- tors with the biggest responsibility do not first address seriously their re-spective domestic political economy issues which have precluded them from playing coherently their role at the multilateral talks.    The cost of failure in the Doha Round is not only the income op-portunities forgone for both developed and developing countries that its successful conclusion would provide, but more importantly the losses that all will incur if the system is allowed to deteriorate and eventually proves incapable of preventing countries from back-pedaling into pro-tectionism&#8212;as has happened before in history. Despite its achievements, the multilateral trading system is not yet a consolidated global public good. It remains vulnerable to serious erosion by episodes of protec-tionism. It also has limited capacity to support the integration into the world economy of many countries that have been left on the sidelines of globalization despite formally belonging to the WTO.</span></div><div left="57.1" right="204.28" top="269.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="269.65" x1="204.28" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.29; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 7.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">A strategy to resume the Doha Round</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.75" top="241.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="241.65" x1="337.75" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 241.65; y1: 251.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">This Task Force endorses the full resumption of the Doha Round as soon as possible.
