The most effective institutions create incentives for states to participate and sanctions for non-participation. For example, when states negotiated the Montreal Protocol governing the reduction of substances that deplete the ozone layer, its framers were aware that they would face tough challenges in generating state compliance with vol-untary controls. Recognizing the likelihood of significant free-rider problems down the road, the group of states that led negotiations agreed a package of incentives for compliance and disincentives against free riding (trade sanctions). This was accompanied by monitoring compli-ance, essential for supplying incentives and for applying sanctions. Similarly the binding dispute resolution system of the World Trade Organization is critical to the effectiveness of the international trade regime. One can only imagine the chaos in international trade if states could cheat on the rules without consequence. As a general rule, the harder a global public good is to produce, the more contested are the preferences that surround it and the stronger will need to be the international mechanisms involved in its production. In a world of 200 states with sharply divergent preferences, global problems will likely be solved only by effective international mechanisms&#8212;ones with teeth, the legitimacy to act and the necessary governance and ac-countability reforms to make their action credible. International mechanisms currently operate under a growing cloud of public and political skepticism based on a combination of uncertainty about effectiveness and results and concerns about corruption. This is eroding the willingness of national constituencies to free up the resources to pay for international activities or goods. Even the most prosperous and traditionally most generous countries face strains on their finances and important domestic constraints in devoting adequate resources to in-ternational programmes and institutions widely seen as unreliable and unaccountable. The demand for accountability is further fuelled by the growing engagement of private sector actors, including civil society. In most instances global public goods will not be agreed and will not be provided in the absence of decision-making within and imple-mentation by international institutions. And in most instances, currently, the decision-making mechanisms of those institutions are widely per-ceived as illegitimate. There is thus an acute need for reform to the governing mechanisms of the major international institutions, as well as </span></div></body></html>
