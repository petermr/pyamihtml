Similarly, appar-ent links between environmental degradation and conflict are not met with joined responses.Confidence in international cooperation has also been shaken by research that suggests that aid sometimes has been ineffective in com- bating poverty and by revelations of isolated cases of financial impropri-ety by international officials. More generally, insufficient accountability for money and activities within international mechanisms is eroding both public and political support for international aid and international institutions, precisely when they are needed most. And overlaying all of this, the international arena is still struggling to overcome the loss of trust that arose from radically different interpretations of the course of events that led to the war in Iraq. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="260.96" top="367.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="367.8" x1="260.96" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 138.77; y0: 367.8; y1: 377.8; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">The responsibility of states</span></div><div left="132.66" right="410.5" top="339.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="339.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 135.99; y0: 339.65; y1: 349.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">In assessing the prospects for international cooperation, it is indispens-able to be aware of three phenomena that have occurred since the end of the cold war. First, there has been a change in the nature and distribu- tion of economic power and influence at the international level. Mili-tary and political power have become more heavily concentrated. At the same time, more than a dozen developing countries, with combined populations of half of humanity, have gained considerable influence in the global market. Second, the spread of democracy and information technology have brought hundreds of millions of voices into debates about international policy, many of them the voices of people who do not profit from the global economy, residing in countries that do not participate meaningfully in international decision-making. And third, a growing portion of economic activity is being conducted by companies with global reach and massive resources creating circumstances that can limit states&#8217; abilities to shape action beyond their borders.Yet the governance mechanisms of international institutions have not been adapted to these developments. Instead some developed and developing powers have neglected and at times abused international institutions as a vehicle for cooperation, failing to lead efforts at reform, and choosing to work through ad hoc, bilateral and regional mecha-</span></div></body></html>
