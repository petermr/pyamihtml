It is not known whether climate change will be abrupt, or how abrupt climate change, should it occur, would materialize (weak-ening in the thermohaline circulation and disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are two possibilities). The second is that current strategies do too little to respond to the needs of communities most vulnerable to climate change&#8212;most of them in developing countries. Evidence suggests that agriculture in the tropical zones of Africa will be particularly hard hit. Countries there are already among the poorest in the world, and small changes in climate could impose substantial changes in human well-being, undermining efforts to promote development. The most efficient way to address climate change would be to broaden the use of carbon taxes. Effective use of such a tax would generate a double dividend.</span><span x0="170.32" y0="357.96" x1="176.09" style="x0: 170.32; x1: 173.17; y0: 357.96; y1: 363.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">52</span><span x0="179.34" y0="353.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 179.34; x1: 184.65; y0: 353.65; y1: 363.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">First, the tax would help reduce emis-sions of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas. Several countries have adopted national carbon taxes,</span><span x0="240.69" y0="329.96" x1="246.46" style="x0: 240.69; x1: 243.54; y0: 329.96; y1: 335.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">53</span><span x0="249.43" y0="325.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 249.43; x1: 256.83; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 7.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">while others have re-sisted&#8212;notwithstanding rising oil and fuel prices.

The carbon tax has been promoted by several, including the High-Level Panel on Financing for Development. The Panel concluded that to impose a minimum level of taxation on consumption of fossil fuels was better than other policy options to combat global warming. </span></div><div left="59.88" right="172.63" top="129.8"><span x0="59.88" y0="129.8" x1="172.63" style="x0: 59.88; x1: 66.73; y0: 129.8; y1: 139.8; width: 6.85; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">A multi-track approach </span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="101.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="101.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 101.65; y1: 111.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">There currently is a reluctance to consider the international adop-tion of carbon taxes, despite the economic and environmental benefits.
