Thus the &#8220;good&#8221; in global public good is often con-tested. What might be a highly desirable public good for one country or group of people might not be so for another.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="548.72" x1="81.71" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.05; y0: 548.72; y1: 562.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="93.1" y0="549.65" x1="186.69" style="x0: 93.1; x1: 99.66; y0: 549.65; y1: 559.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">The &#8220;free rider&#8221; problem. </span><span x0="187.29" y0="549.65" x1="337.73" style="x0: 187.29; x1: 195.52; y0: 549.65; y1: 559.65; width: 8.23; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Once a public good is produced and made available to one, in principle it becomes available to all, and it is hard to exclude others from its consumption. Conse- quently there is an incentive for every party to wait until an- other provides that public good, then enjoy its consumption.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="478.72" x1="81.64" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.05; y0: 478.72; y1: 492.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="93.1" y0="479.65" x1="197.35" style="x0: 93.1; x1: 99.66; y0: 479.65; y1: 489.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">The &#8220;weakest link&#8221; problem. </span><span x0="197.44" y0="479.65" x1="337.7" style="x0: 197.44; x1: 202.34; y0: 479.65; y1: 489.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Some global public goods can only be produced when every government fully complies with a common approach, such as in efforts to eradicate an infectious disease. Success can be eroded by a single act of non-compli- ance. This makes for arduous and long-term problems of coop-eration. And the risk of failure is such that it is hard to convince governments to make the necessary investments.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="380.72" x1="81.71" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.05; y0: 380.72; y1: 394.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="93.1" y0="381.65" x1="194.18" style="x0: 93.1; x1: 99.66; y0: 381.65; y1: 391.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">The &#8220;summation&#8221; problem. </span><span x0="193.36" y0="381.65" x1="337.69" style="x0: 193.36; x1: 203.36; y0: 381.65; y1: 391.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Where the successful production of a particular global public good is literally the result or sum of the individual efforts of all the separate participants, such as mitigating global climate change, there are hard challenges in ensuring compliance and sustaining momentum with long-term global initiatives. The major barriers to solving global problems, then, do not lie with institutional strain&#8212;a symptom of a problem, not its cause. Instead, the major obstacles emerge from the fact that the international sphere is characterized principally by voluntary interaction between sovereign states&#8212;all with ideas and values and interests of their own. While social, political and economic interactions draw peoples together, as does an increasingly globalized private sector, separate na-tional governments remain responsible for balancing and legitimizing the policies to structure their interactions. While organizations such as the European Union are altering our conceptions of sovereignty, democratically elected governments remain the most consistently  legitimate form of authority yet devised, and electorates are often less keen than politicians to accept multilateral restrictions on domestic sovereignty. Sovereignty, often declared to be in rapid retreat, perse- veres nonetheless.Thus voluntary cooperation between independent, sovereign states remains the hallmark of the international system and its essen-</span></div></body></html>
