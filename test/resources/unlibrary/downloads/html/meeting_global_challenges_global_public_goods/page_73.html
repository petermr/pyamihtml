There is broad agreement among policy-makers on the causes of financial instability: unsustainable macroeconomic policies, fragile fi- nancial systems, institutional weaknesses and structural flaws in inter- national financial markets.</span><span x0="236.0" y0="539.96" x1="241.72" style="x0: 236.0; x1: 238.86; y0: 539.96; y1: 545.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">63</span><span x0="243.87" y0="535.65" x1="413.25" style="x0: 243.87; x1: 250.64; y0: 535.65; y1: 545.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">And much has been done to address these causes. There have been significant improvements in conceptualizing and implementing macroeconomic policies. Financial markets and in-stitutions are better regulated. And the multilateral framework is better prepared, starting with the IMF, to facilitate cooperation in regulating financial markets and conducting macroeconomic policies.</span><span x0="363.01" y0="469.96" x1="370.34" style="x0: 363.01; x1: 365.86; y0: 469.96; y1: 475.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">64 </span><span x0="370.2" y0="465.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 370.2; x1: 376.97; y0: 465.65; y1: 475.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The prob- lem is that few of the institutions created for these purposes have the po-litical independence or power to sanction a country that breaches agreed policies. For example, the IMF conducts surveillance, including for global financial issues, and twice yearly it publishes simulations and makes policy recommendations on such matters.</span><span x0="268.04" y0="399.96" x1="273.69" style="x0: 268.04; x1: 270.89; y0: 399.96; y1: 405.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">65</span><span x0="275.23" y0="395.65" x1="413.25" style="x0: 275.23; x1: 282.0; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The problem, however, is that IMF management cannot issue blunt warnings of global risks, either publicly or privately,</span><span x0="177.98" y0="371.96" x1="183.63" style="x0: 177.98; x1: 180.83; y0: 371.96; y1: 377.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">66</span><span x0="186.12" y0="367.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 186.12; x1: 191.12; y0: 367.65; y1: 377.65; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">due to the fear of being punished by its shareholders, espe-cially major ones. In an optimal world, organizations such as the IMF should be given the independence, perhaps by changing their governance structures, to speak out clearly and bluntly on issues that threaten financial stability.</span><span x0="404.84" y0="315.96" x1="410.5" style="x0: 404.84; x1: 407.7; y0: 315.96; y1: 321.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">67</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.25" top="297.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="297.65" x1="413.25" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.43; y0: 297.65; y1: 307.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">And the policy recommendations should be equally strong whether they concern policy adjustments for small countries or large. The governor of the Bank of England recently suggested that &#8220;serious consideration should be given to a non-resident board&#8221;, arguing that such a structure would avoid unnecessary political interference on issues of surveillance.</span><span x0="379.22" y0="245.96" x1="384.87" style="x0: 379.22; x1: 382.07; y0: 245.96; y1: 251.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">68</span></div><div left="147.66" right="413.29" top="227.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="227.65" x1="413.29" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.43; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The IMF Managing Director has recently suggested strengthening the Fund&#8217;s role in global surveillance. If the large shareholders of the IMF were to recognize that it is in their own interests to strengthen the multilateralization of surveillance, and as a consequence award IMF management greater independence to speak out, such an instrument would be particularly effective.</span></div><div left="132.66" right="290.84" top="129.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="129.65" x1="290.84" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 136.41; y0: 129.65; y1: 139.65; width: 3.75; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Incremental improvements to the system </span></div><div left="132.66" right="410.5" top="101.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="101.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 142.66; y0: 101.65; y1: 111.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">We currently see limited scope for delegating more authority to inter- national regulatory and supervisory bodies.
