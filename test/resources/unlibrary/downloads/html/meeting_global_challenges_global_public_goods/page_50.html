Catalytic leadership is not enough, however. The catalytic action of responsible leadership is always required, but so too is a process that </span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.73" top="507.66"><span x0="57.1" y0="507.66" x1="337.73" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 61.79; y0: 507.66; y1: 517.66; width: 4.69; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">generates broad support for action, either through formal, institutional decision-making or through participatory negotiations to build consen-sus. For this reason, and because supplying global public goods almost always requires long-term, reliable commitments, catalytic leadership must normally be matched to effective institutions for delivery. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="139.66" top="423.66"><span x0="57.1" y0="423.66" x1="139.66" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.66; y0: 423.66; y1: 433.66; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Effective institutions </span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="395.66"><span x0="57.1" y0="395.66" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 67.1; y0: 395.66; y1: 405.66; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">With some exceptions, global public goods are produced over sus- tained periods of engagement by all or many states. Whereas respon-sible leadership and catalytic action can be critical in overcoming obstacles, it is rarely the case that global public goods can be achieved without sustained and reliable engagement within institutions, often over decades. For example, once the Soviet Union had initiated ac-tion against smallpox in 1959, it took over 20 years of sustained engagement by almost all states, coordinated and supported by the WHO, to eradicate it.</span><span x0="146.39" y0="287.96" x1="152.19" style="x0: 146.39; x1: 149.24; y0: 287.96; y1: 293.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">23</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.73" top="269.66"><span x0="72.1" y0="269.66" x1="337.73" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.87; y0: 269.66; y1: 279.66; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">There are two facets to the role of institutions in providing global public goods: they are the main venue for states to negotiate and agree on preferences and priorities for global issues; and they are tools for implementation. Most important, regional and international institutions are the pri-mary place for states to come together to shape common preferences or agree on priorities. It is here that the &#8220;good&#8221; in global public good is contested and agreed (or not). And it is in the governance mechanisms of regional and international institutions that state preferences are most actively debated and the direction and strategies for supplying global public goods ultimately decided. Some of these mechanisms entail negotiations by all states, such as in the World Health Assembly. And while negotiations of the whole are cumbersome, in the case of infectious disease they are appropriate because all states must implement the solutions.
