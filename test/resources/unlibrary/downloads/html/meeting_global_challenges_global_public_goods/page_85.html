Nevertheless, there lacks any clear consensus on all the necessary el-ements of a strategy to combat international terrorism and their relative weighting. There has been an over-supply of rhetoric and an under-sup-ply of thoughtful analysis, with a lot more attention paid to responding to surface manifestations than to understanding and addressing underly-ing causes and currents. The UN Secretary-General made an important attempt to redress that balance in Madrid in March 2005, arguing that five distinct goals had to be pursued simultaneously: dissuade disaffected groups from choosing terrorism as a tactic; deny terrorists the means to carry out attacks; deter states from supporting terrorists; develop state capacity to prevent terrorism; and defend human rights in the struggle against terrorism.</span><span x0="201.26" y0="427.96" x1="208.6" style="x0: 201.26; x1: 204.12; y0: 427.96; y1: 433.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">84 </span><span x0="208.76" y0="423.65" x1="413.27" style="x0: 208.76; x1: 216.99; y0: 423.65; y1: 433.65; width: 8.23; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Operationally, these may be seen as translating into a five-part strategy: </span><span x0="147.66" y0="394.72" x1="157.49" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 394.72; y1: 408.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="395.65" x1="247.84" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 175.64; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 6.98; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">A protection strategy </span><span x0="248.54" y0="395.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 248.54; x1: 251.25; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 2.71; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">focused on preventive national security in all its forms, the guarding of trade and transport routes and ensuring in particular that potential terrorists have no access to fissile nuclear material.
