First, there has been an enormous increase in the creation of knowledge. Second, there is huge growth in the role of the private sector in gen-erating knowledge, which has become more important economically. Third, the greater openness of borders to products and people and the development of transportation and communications (particularly digital information technologies) have created new global opportunities for accessing and disseminating knowledge. Fourth, the use of intellectual property rights to protect knowledge has restricted access to informa- tion and technologies. Knowledge is increasingly privatized and com- mercialized&#8212;even knowledge developed with public funding.</span><span x0="378.34" y0="427.96" x1="384.05" style="x0: 378.34; x1: 381.19; y0: 427.96; y1: 433.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">89</span></div><div left="132.66" right="286.65" top="395.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="395.65" x1="286.65" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 136.41; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 3.75; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">International cooperation for knowledge</span></div><div left="132.66" right="410.5" top="367.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="367.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.43; y0: 367.65; y1: 377.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Two issues have especially significant cross-border implications: intel-lectual property and common knowledge. </span><span x0="147.66" y0="339.65" x1="224.23" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 150.89; y0: 339.65; y1: 349.65; width: 3.23; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Intellectual property. </span><span x0="226.14" y0="339.65" x1="413.35" style="x0: 226.14; x1: 232.91; y0: 339.65; y1: 349.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">At the international level, the long-standing focus has been on cross-border reciprocity in honouring patents, copy-rights and trademarks protected under national laws through treaties administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization, and most significantly by the WTO&#8217;s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of In-tellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) that came into effect as a result of the Uruguay Round.</span><span x0="216.94" y0="259.96" x1="222.66" style="x0: 216.94; x1: 219.8; y0: 259.96; y1: 265.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">90</span></div><div left="147.66" right="225.42" top="241.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="241.65" x1="225.42" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.95; y0: 241.65; y1: 251.65; width: 7.29; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Common knowledge. </span><span x0="226.42" y0="241.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 226.42; x1: 233.19; y0: 241.65; y1: 251.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The common knowledge system includes the vast stock of knowledge in the public domain reflecting centuries of human endeavour. It includes knowledge that is &#8220;graduating&#8221; from intel-lectual property protection with the expiration of patents and copyrights. It includes new scientific findings from basic research for which intel-lectual property protection is not sought (such as the Human Genome Project). And it includes open source software (such as Linux), research tools and databases for which protection is also voluntarily not sought. The issue of intellectual property versus common knowledge is par- ticularly important given the critical role of the private sector in knowl-edge generation. For the most part private companies invest in knowledge generation on the basis of expected returns from intellectual property rights. The very mechanism of intellectual property rights, however, also </span></div></body></html>
