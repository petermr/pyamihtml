The Interna-tional Atomic Energy Agency&#8217;s (IAEA) annual report is another good example, closely monitoring country implementation of agreed proto- cols in all countries where it is deployed. But the lack of credible, inde-pendent monitoring of all countries&#8217; compliance with broader features of the non-proliferation regime diminishes the overall political value of IAEA reporting. Moreover, the fact that three countries in the past five years have been able to misreport and evade IAEA inspections</span><span x0="326.36" y0="497.96" x1="334.93" style="x0: 326.36; x1: 329.22; y0: 497.96; y1: 503.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">111</span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="479.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="479.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 62.31; y0: 479.65; y1: 489.65; width: 5.21; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">highlights the need for more stringent monitoring and verification pro-cedures and mechanisms. Other institutions do less. Partly to fill the void, other actors&#8212;both in the official sector and in the policy research community&#8212;have launched monitoring initiatives, such as the Security Council Report, which tracks the decisions and actions of members of the UN Security Council, and the Canadian Centre for Treaty Compliance.</span><span x0="230.6" y0="399.96" x1="239.11" style="x0: 230.6; x1: 233.46; y0: 399.96; y1: 405.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">112</span><span x0="240.42" y0="395.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 240.42; x1: 250.42; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">While many of these ef-forts are excellent, they do not add up to a coherent information base for policy-makers and private citizens to gauge progress, assess comparative country performance and determine priorities for action. Nor is there an agreed basis for evaluating international organizations&#8217; performance and results or a baseline for tracking progress over time. Most regional and international organizations, as part of their re-form programmes, need to upgrade their monitoring and surveillance functions. To this end a concerted investment programme by interna- tional agencies is needed to develop and analyse data sources on coun-try compliance with their obligations, which will also contribute to strengthening their surveillance functions. The best approach is to build stringent reporting requirements into regional and international agreements. A strong example is the Mon- treal Protocol, which built effective monitoring and reporting require-ments into the basic agreement, with carrots and sticks attached to the outcome of that reporting. There is also value in additional, voluntary reporting standards. For natural resource revenue management in fragile states, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) was launched at the Johan- nesburg Summit of September 2002 and endorsed by the G-8 Meet-ing of 2004, building on a non-governmental organization (NGO) campaign, &#8220;Publish What You Pay&#8221;. Its purpose is to encourage, on a voluntary basis, greater transparency in the revenues that compa-</span></div></body></html>
