We concur with the UN Secretary-General that in fighting this scourge, five distinct goals have to be pursued simultaneously: dissuade disaffected groups from choos-ing terrorism as a tactic; deny terrorists the means to carry out attacks; deter states from supporting terrorists; develop state capacity to prevent terrorism; and defend human rights in the struggle against terrorism. The pursuit of these goals requires the following operational ele-ments: a protection strategy focused on preventive national security; safeguarding trade and transport routes and ensuring that potential ter-rorists have no access to fissile nuclear material; a strategy for enhancing cooperation among police, intelligence services and, in very extreme cases, military forces; a political strategy to tackle grievances that mani-festly increase domestic support for terrorist actions; a capacity-building strategy to help states develop their own ability to combat terrorism; and a psychological strategy, including the universal adoption, by a vote at the General Assembly, of the definition of terrorism proposed by the UN High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Among other elements, that definition describes terrorism as any action that is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants when the purpose of such an act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population or to compel a government or an interna- tional organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="213.65" x1="251.69" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.73; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 5.63; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Preventing the spread and use of nuclear weapons. </span><span x0="252.15" y0="213.65" x1="337.71" style="x0: 252.15; x1: 258.92; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The establishment of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its related agencies, protocols and control mechanisms constitutes one of the most important accomplishments of the multilateral system. Yet, appallingly, several events have eroded the viability of the NPT, and successive opportunities to reverse that trend have been lost. Political attention to the disarmament agenda has receded, but the threat these weapons pose is growing. These developments are a recipe for mounting risk, possibly disaster. To address this crucial issue we fully endorse the four sets of recom-mendations on nuclear weapons of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission (otherwise known as the Blix Commission): agreeing on </span></div></body></html>
