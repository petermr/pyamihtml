In the area of financial stabil-ity, for example, the consequences of the globalizing market are seen in strains at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF&#8217;s manage-ment of the financial crisis in East Asia in 1997&#8211;98 is illustrative. It has been recognized by many, including the Fund&#8217;s Independent Evalua-tion Office, that the Fund did not adequately recognize or analyse the risks associated with its own policies of capital account liberalization. The financial crisis that erupted at the end of the 1990s eroded the fi-nancial health of the rising East Asian economies, and in some instances challenged internal political stability. Similar problems were apparent in Argentina&#8217;s financial crisis. The postwar institutions are also struggling to adapt to technologi-cal change. Perhaps the most acute example is the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose mechanisms are too weak to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons. As access to nuclear technology ad-vances, countries&#8217; ability to move from civilian nuclear energy to a nuclear weapons programme becomes far easier. The result is that it is more difficult for the IAEA to gather reliable information about the nuclear capacities and intentions of its member countries.Nor are strains limited to security. Similar stresses confront responses to the growing threat of infectious diseases. Infectious disease control is an area that has attracted investment and leadership, sometimes by private actors, sometimes by governments. And the WHO is perhaps the one international institution whose reputation has improved in the post 9/11 era. Yet senior WHO officials have warned that their ability to cope with large-scale outbreaks of new infectious diseases may be severely limited. Moreover, growing awareness of the interconnections between these issue areas has not been met by adequate cooperation among respon-sible institutions. Although it is more widely understood that there are important security dimensions to international health, and vice versa, security and health matters are treated as separate and distinct institu-tional spheres. International terrorism has caused new concerns about the security of trade and transport systems, but no international body has the breadth of mandate to ensure that new security approaches do not interfere with international trade rules and commitments.
