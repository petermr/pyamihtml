See Barrett (2006b). Pioneering research by William Nordhaus suggests that an &#8220;optimal&#8221; mitigation policy initiated in 2005 would yield a benefit equal to $283 billion in present value terms at a present value cost of $92 billion. The net benefit would thus be $192 billion in present value, and the benefit-cost ratio 3:1. Nordhaus&#8217; supporting calculations indicate that the marginal benefit of mitigation is just over $9 per ton car-bon, which would be the optimal carbon tax, and that the corresponding optimal reduction in carbon emissions would be roughly 5%. 127.

The World Bank&#8217;s International Development Association, the Global Environment Facility, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the African Development Fund and the Asian Devel-opment Fund all have regular replenishment mechanisms. In October 2003 the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria also decided to establish a similar funding model.141.
