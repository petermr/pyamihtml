Five countries have implemented a national carbon tax: Finland, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. New Zealand will intro- duce such a tax in 2007. 54. See Barrett (2007). 55. Based on El-Ashry (2005). 56. See http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/climat/emission.Important are also the World Bank&#8217;s Prototype Carbon Fund, launched in 1999, and its more recent series of carbon funds, which aim to en-hance confidence in the carbon market, reduce entry risks and address market failures. 57.

While difficult to quantify, attempts at costing financial crises point to the magnitudes; a study by Steffany Griffith-Jones and Ricardo Gottschalk, Institute of Development Studies (2004), estimates that the emerging market countries suffered an output loss during the 1995&#8211; 2002 period of $1,250 billion, mainly as a direct result of major cur- rency crises. That is equal to an annual average of around $150 billion.Another study&#8212;see Dobson and Hufbauer (2001)&#8212;estimates that the average annual output loss from currency and banking crises amounted to 2.2% in Latin America in the 1980s and 1.4% in Asia in the 1990s.63.

During the financial crises of the 1980s, lead banks brought credi- tor banks to the table to hammer out agreements, aided by moral sua-sion exercised by governments and central banks to participate in the deal. But by the late 1990s, as the structure of sovereign finance had shifted from syndicated bank loans to short-term deposits and bonds, such approaches clearly were no longer possible.</span></div></body></html>
