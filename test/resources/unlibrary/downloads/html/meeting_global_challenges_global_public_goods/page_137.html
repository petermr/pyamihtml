Such estimates&#8212;al-though often difficult to establish&#8212;are helpful for policy-makers when examining the total package of contributions for global public goods made by countries. The International Maritime Organization represents this principle the best; membership costs are in proportion to the rela-tive size of a country&#8217;s merchant fleet. Third, it is important that all countries with sufficient capacity par-ticipate and contribute financially in replenishments. This is increasingly the case today with emerging economies participating and contributing in all major replenishments. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="308.88" top="451.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="451.65" x1="308.88" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 136.41; y0: 451.65; y1: 461.65; width: 3.75; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Improve national systems for global financing</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.03" top="423.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="423.65" x1="413.03" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 135.99; y0: 423.65; y1: 433.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">If funding for global public goods is to be additional to ODA, as it should be, states will have to adapt their national spending systems in four ways: </span><span x0="147.66" y0="380.72" x1="156.51" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 380.72; y1: 394.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="381.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 176.68; y0: 381.65; y1: 391.65; width: 8.02; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Revise national budget mechanisms to allow for greater flex-ibility in spending abroad, including by the creation of new mechanisms for more flexible use of domestic, sectoral budgets to pay for international activities and capacity building within those sectors. </span><span x0="147.66" y0="310.72" x1="156.44" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 310.72; y1: 324.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="311.65" x1="413.22" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 175.43; y0: 311.65; y1: 321.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Adopt dual-track national budgeting systems to ensure that global sectoral spending is properly allocated in national budgets and not incorrectly allocated against development budgets.</span><span x0="147.66" y0="268.72" x1="157.28" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 268.72; y1: 282.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="269.65" x1="413.29" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 175.43; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Track expenditure on global public goods by introducing a line item for them in the OECD statistics (see below).</span><span x0="147.66" y0="240.72" x1="157.28" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 240.72; y1: 254.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="241.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 173.97; y0: 241.65; y1: 251.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Fulfil pledges for increased allocations for development assis- tance, ensuring that sufficient resources are provided for de-velopment activities that are also critical for the provision of global public goods (such as health sector capacity building).One way to capture additional spending would be to introduce a line item for global public goods in the OECD statistics.</span><span x0="365.53" y0="175.96" x1="374.14" style="x0: 365.53; x1: 368.39; y0: 175.96; y1: 181.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">141</span><span x0="377.87" y0="171.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 377.87; x1: 382.77; y0: 171.65; y1: 181.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Such an item would only include contributions for the purposes of global public goods that are not considered official development assistance.
