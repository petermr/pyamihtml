And a government must balance them; an ad-ministration that concentrated on policing but ignored public finances and health would create not only a powerful gendarmerie, but also an anarchic failed state. At the global level, it is also important to balance policy priori- ties. To focus solely on economic growth without considering its en-vironmental impact will create resource shortages and raise the risk of resource wars. States that combine high security with economic pro-tectionism increase the threats they aim to defend against. If we do not see the generation of global public goods as a process of balancing in-terrelated demands and needs, we may progress in some areas, but the international system will remain fragile, and the risks of crisis escalate. In short, the potential gains from a positive interplay between im-proved peace and security, an expanding sphere of prosperity and the protection of the health of peoples and the environment are substantial indeed. And the consequences of a potential negative spiral of protec-tionism, isolationism, deepening international divisions and an erosion of both security and stability are severe. Urgent action is needed to forestall the former and realize the promise of the latter.The provision of these priorities will require energetic action to reform both the political decision-making and financing mechanisms for national and international action.In Part I we showed that historically catalytic efforts&#8212;often by the most powerful&#8212;were required to provide global public goods. Events of recent years have shown that the prospects for realizing such leader-ship do not lie primarily in formal international institutions. They are vital tools, and their health must be assured. But they are also cumber-some, unable to respond quickly to emerging challenges, unable to act nimbly across different issue areas and unable to generate critical break-throughs on policy and institutional reforms to seize the opportunities available to meet common goals or to avoid shared risks. We conclude, as others have before us, that the best hope for gen-erating the kind of catalytic leadership necessary for the provision of global public goods lies with the establishment of a new, informal forum. We propose, accordingly, a Global 25 forum that brings together the heads of state and government from the developed and developing countries that are the most responsible, capable and representative, as well as relevant representatives of other groups and regions. With ap-propriate links to the formal institutions, such a forum could do much </span></div></body></html>
