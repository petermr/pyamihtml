In fact three dimensions of that relationship can be characterized. First, whereas cooperation for development relies on the traditional divisions between donor states with advanced financial capacities and recipient states with limited resources, the provision of global public goods transcends such divisions; global public goods affect almost all states, and many or all states must be involved in their provision. Second, global public goods can propel development (see box 2.2). For example, financial stability (which results in part from the global public good of the international financial regulation system) is critical to achieving broader economic development. There is also evidence that development assistance is more effective in countries where gov-ernments have sound fiscal and economic policy. A country&#8217;s policy environment, however, depends on more than the policies it adopts unilaterally. It depends also on the international policy environment, including such areas as international trade. Improve these systems, and the returns on development should increase. Third, because limited state capacity serves as a barrier to the provision of many important global public goods, development is fundamental to their supply, including goods for health, security and the environment.</span><span x0="327.04" y0="203.96" x1="332.69" style="x0: 327.04; x1: 329.9; y0: 203.96; y1: 209.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">17</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.7" top="185.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="185.65" x1="337.7" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 82.1; y0: 185.65; y1: 195.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">With good reason, some are concerned that financing for global public goods may crowd out traditional development assistance. There is of course a relationship between the two. For example, money spent on building national public health capacity in devel-oping countries will have important development results, but also contribute to global efforts to combat infectious disease. But given the different character of global public goods, including the fact that those who finance their supply also profit from their consumption, financing for development and for global public goods should be dis-</span></div></body></html>
