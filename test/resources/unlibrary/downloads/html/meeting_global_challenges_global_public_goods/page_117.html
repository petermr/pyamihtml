While the executive board seeks to operate on a consensus basis, the fact that many countries, particularly rapidly growing emerg-ing-market nations, are significantly underrepresented in quota shares undermines the sense of equity and balance on which true consensus must rest.</span><span x0="170.29" y0="553.96" x1="178.86" style="x0: 170.29; x1: 173.14; y0: 553.96; y1: 559.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">105</span><span x0="181.51" y0="549.65" x1="413.3" style="x0: 181.51; x1: 187.86; y0: 549.65; y1: 559.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Biasing the policy debate and the resulting decisions, these distortions contribute to the perception that the institution unfairly fa-vours developed country interests&#8212;although there are also distortions within developed country shares. The quota reformulation is exceed-ingly complex and has thus far not produced a consensus. At this stage, in line with the Managing Director&#8217;s strategy, more weight should be given to the most underrepresented countries.</span><span x0="389.9" y0="469.96" x1="398.42" style="x0: 389.9; x1: 392.76; y0: 469.96; y1: 475.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">106</span><span x0="402.01" y0="465.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 402.01; x1: 405.34; y0: 465.65; y1: 475.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">In the longer run, the distribution of board chairs should also be revised to better reflect the changing structure of the world economy.

The almost identical composition of the IMF and World Bank boards is outdated and should be replaced by boards whose composition better represents the interests of the key stakeholders in, and the mandates of, the respective organizations. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="243.48" top="297.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="297.65" x1="243.48" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.16; y0: 297.65; y1: 307.65; width: 7.5; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">UN Security Council reform</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.42" top="269.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="269.65" x1="413.42" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.43; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The Security Council was designed by the UN Charter to balance extra responsibility for the powerful, ensuring engagement and regional representation, ensuring commitment. The veto was introduced to en-sure that the most powerful states felt able to bring issues of direct importance to them to the Council chamber; this privilege was bal-anced by the concept that the most powerful should also accept extra responsibility. What the UN Charter did not do, however, was include a mecha-nism for changes in power distribution and regional composition to be reflected in a changing composition of the Security Council. Despite significant changes in function of the UN, in the kinds of power and capabilities needed to support it, and in the quadrupling of its mem- bership, the Security Council has been reformed only once. Its cur-rent composition, the continued availability of the veto to the postwar powers and the disparity in influence between the Permanent 5 and </span></div></body></html>
