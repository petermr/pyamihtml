This does not negate recognition that the national level is critical in the provision of global public goods. In-deed we stress the principle of subsidiarity&#8212;solving problems closest to where they occur. But the most enduring difficulties in providing global public goods are found at the international level, and it is at this level that we have been mandated to focus our analysis.That analysis shows there are fundamental differences between leadership at the national level and the kind of leadership required for international cooperation. At the national level governments act with authority or mandate. At the local and national level the provision of public goods is typi-cally organized by the state, with authority to tax, regulate and even coerce to ensure such provision. At the global level there is no institution with equivalent powers. For good reasons, there is no world government with the authority to tax, to conscript, to regulate or to quarantine. Therefore, at the international level, action to initiate the provision of a public good must be voluntary. But, given the natural reluctance of nation states to constrain their sovereignty, as well as the free-rider problem, voluntarism to trigger the provision of a global public good does not occur easily.  Historically it has proven necessary for one or several countries with an enlightened vision and clear sense of responsibility to ignite the processes conducive to the solution of problems that may affect all of humanity.The question is: it is up to whom to play this role in our time? We submit that it is up to the countries that are relatively richer, with larger populations, bigger defence and security capabilities that have been his-torically influential and that, typically, have benefited the most from the rule-based multilateral system. These countries have a special respon-sibility to catalyse action for improving the provision of global public goods. These countries have the responsibility to move first towards goals for the good of everyone, putting forward initiatives for enhanc- ing cooperation and committing resources for their effective realiza-</span></div></body></html>
