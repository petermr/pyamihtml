The revelations of the A.Q. Khan smuggling network highlighted the limitations of the NSG&#8217;s approach, though the circumstances under which A.Q. Khan operated were highly specific and difficult to replicate. Nevertheless the threat of smuggling of materials and weapons is a real one. It has been met in small part first by the Nunn-Lugar Initiative (the cre-ation of a private foundation to buy back nuclear materials) and more recently by the promulgation first by the United States and then the G-8 of the Proliferation Security Initiative. In short, political attention to the disarmament agenda has receded, but the threat these weapons pose is growing&#8212;a recipe for mounting risk, possibly disaster. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="142.44" top="395.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="395.65" x1="142.44" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.66; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Elements of a strategy</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.75" top="367.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="367.65" x1="337.75" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 367.65; y1: 377.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">As our report was being finalized, the Blix Commission issued its final report.
