The main case rests on the critical needs that are met, and the global ills avoided and global peace and prosper-ity promoted, by the supply of global public goods. But cost-benefit analysis of this type&#8212;especially if refined by evidence-based research, as argued in chapter 9&#8212;can certainly be helpful in establishing priori-ties and in mobilizing domestic support for financing, both in terms of shoring up support for existing commitments and for necessary addi-tional commitments. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="328.73" top="423.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="423.8" x1="328.73" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 66.54; y0: 423.8; y1: 433.8; width: 9.44; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Who?

It is in states&#8217; interest to do so, as it is their citizens and their private sectors that benefit. This case needs to be made more consistently and more effectively to national parliaments and political constituencies. The financially strong states have particular responsibilities here, though not exclusive ones. If the supply of global public goods is to be addressed, these states will have to accept their responsibilities and make additional and increasing financial commitments. But states can also do much more to mobilize the market and harness its power, as they increasingly do in the sphere of traditional national public policy. With the correct incentives and disincentives in place, the market can be a powerful tool through which to provide global public goods. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="120.89" top="199.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="199.65" x1="120.89" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.81; y0: 199.65; y1: 209.65; width: 7.71; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">National action </span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="171.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="171.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 171.65; y1: 181.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The national level is critical in the supply of global public goods.
