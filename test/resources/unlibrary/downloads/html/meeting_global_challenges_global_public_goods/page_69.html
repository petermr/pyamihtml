Developed countries would commit to reducing their emissions by adopting a specific target. Developing countries would adopt differentiated targets; they can first increase emissions to meet their immediate economic development needs, but then agree to sta-bilize emissions and eventually begin to reduce emissions by a set date. They would also commit to increase their energy efficiency as they pursue economic development.This scheme would build on the mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, such as allowing countries to trade their obligations to limit emissions. Carbon trading mobilizes financial resources, contributes to systematic emissions reduction and provides a long-term incentive to invest in climate friendly technologies. The most ambitious pilot project thus far is the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, which could help European countries reduce their compliance costs by half com-pared with meeting their Kyoto commitments through domestic means only.</span><span x0="151.58" y0="315.96" x1="157.29" style="x0: 151.58; x1: 154.43; y0: 315.96; y1: 321.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">56</span><span x0="159.75" y0="311.65" x1="413.26" style="x0: 159.75; x1: 166.52; y0: 311.65; y1: 321.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Though the scheme has not yet been an unqualified success, it is still in its infancy and holds the prospect to achieve more as states more fully comply with its provisions. </span><span x0="147.66" y0="269.65" x1="246.24" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.95; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 7.29; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Clean energy technologies. </span><span x0="247.37" y0="269.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 247.37; x1: 252.27; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Substantial emissions reductions will re- quire a technological revolution through a combination of private sec-tor innovation and multilateral research and development.
