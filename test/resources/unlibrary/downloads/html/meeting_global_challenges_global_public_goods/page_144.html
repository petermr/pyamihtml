The first step is to enhance the prospects for catalytic action and re-sponsible leadership by creating a forum in which those states with the greatest capabilities can make the necessary commitments and generate the necessary political momentum towards both the implementation of specific strategies and the adoption of systemic reforms. Specifically we call for the establishment of an informal forum, the Global 25, bringing together those states and relevant representatives of other groups and regions in a group small enough to allow substantive discussion and fo- cused initiative, yet sufficiently inclusive to be legitimate and effective. The second step involves reform of both regional and interna-tional institutions to ensure that their governing mechanisms are widely viewed as legitimate. We call for reforms to the governing mechanisms of the IMF and the World Bank, and to the UN Security Council, as well as for broader UN system reform. In the absence of such reforms, the &#8220;good&#8221; in global public goods will be contested, and implementa-tion will suffer. Both sets of reforms would be enhanced by states and institutions adopting a broad strategy of accountability, starting with measures to enhance transparency through evidence-based research, monitoring of state compliance and evaluation of institutional performance. Over time these measures should be complemented by reforms that add heft to assessments of results. These reforms taken together require adequate and appropriate financing and ultimately will help ensure the provision of global public goods.Transcending current international political divisions&#8212;recovering from failed reforms and missed opportunities and overcoming mount-</span></div></body></html>
