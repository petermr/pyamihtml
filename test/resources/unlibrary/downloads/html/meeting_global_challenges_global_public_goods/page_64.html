The facilities proposed for surveillance and R&amp;D could be integrated to enlist funding by industrialized countries. This should be coupled with a commitment to purchase new prod-ucts such as vaccines. </span><span x0="72.1" y0="492.72" x1="81.64" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.05; y0: 492.72; y1: 506.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="93.1" y0="493.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 93.1; x1: 99.04; y0: 493.65; y1: 503.65; width: 5.94; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Endorse and adopt the proposal to use &#8220;advance market com- mitments&#8221; to supply the &#8220;pull&#8221; incentive for innovation.</span><span x0="311.45" y0="483.96" x1="317.13" style="x0: 311.45; x1: 314.3; y0: 483.96; y1: 489.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">46</span><span x0="318.67" y0="479.65" x1="337.71" style="x0: 318.67; x1: 325.44; y0: 479.65; y1: 489.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The World Bank should lead in making credible the promise to pay and raising the needed finance. An advance market commit- ment offers an incentive to stimulate the commercial develop-ment and rapid introduction of new vaccines. As new medical products are developed, qualifying global funds would help de-veloping countries purchase and distribute them. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="117.08" top="353.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="353.8" x1="117.08" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.59; y0: 353.8; y1: 363.8; width: 6.49; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Summing up</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.78" top="325.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="325.65" x1="337.78" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">A multi-pronged strategy of this type would reduce over time the number of infectious diseases confronting global health systems and the deaths they would cause. All states and populations would benefit. Indeed, given the additional benefits from investing in national and global health systems&#8212;direct health benefits and significant de-velopmental benefits&#8212;battling infectious disease perfectly highlights both the necessity of global action to combat common ills and the common global benefit from cooperation to do so. Cooperation to build public health capacity in the developing world is a clear win-win strategy, while failing to cooperate exposes both rich and poor to a growing threat of pandemic disease.Governments, the private sector and civic actors will all have to contribute to expanding the financing available for action in this realm. In the private/civic sector the compelling example provided by Bill &amp; Melinda Gates and Warren Buffet warrants emulation. Gov-ernments, too, will have to address the long-term financial challenges here (issues we address in more depth in chapter 10), highlighting both the achievability and the benefits to be realized from spending the necessary resources.</span></div></body></html>
