But this sense of purpose was short-lived. Since its launch, the round&#8217;s story has been one of key deadlines missed, one WTO Min-isterial Conference (Canc&#250;n, September 2003) collapsed, another one (Hong Kong, December 2005) with meaningless results and, finally, a total suspension of the negotiations for lack of agreement on any of the important issues (July 2006). It is unlikely that the talks can be restored with any chance of success in the near future. The main reason for the Doha breakdown is to be found in the agriculture negotiations. The majority of developed countries has re- sisted effective liberalization in farm trade all along. Years of negotia-tions could not make these countries agree on formulas that would effectively open their farm markets to imports and significantly reduce their most distorting farm subsidies. In fact what was brought to the table even up to the very collapse of the talks would have accomplished little to open up agricultural markets and to temper the huge distortions caused in those markets by the high subsidies granted by OECD coun- tries to their farmers.</span><span x0="218.16" y0="385.96" x1="225.49" style="x0: 218.16; x1: 221.01; y0: 385.96; y1: 391.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">80 </span><span x0="225.83" y0="381.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 225.83; x1: 234.06; y0: 381.65; y1: 391.65; width: 8.23; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Of course more than real farm reform in rich countries was needed to have concluded the Doha Round successfully. Developing countries would have had to undertake at least a modi-cum of agricultural liberalization as well as be more forthcoming about dismantling remaining barriers in industrial goods. More ambition to open up trade in services, including some modest steps in the temporary movement of workers, was also indispensable. The question of how to compensate the poorest countries for their loss of preferences, which a good agreement would have brought about, also needed to be seriously considered along with the issue of how to support the same group of countries to improve their infrastructure and develop their export ca-pacity. An &#8220;aid for trade fund&#8221; commensurate with these endeavours is indispensable for making a large number of developing countries equal members of the multilateral trading system. As argued above, the system is also in great need of stronger provisions to prevent backdoor protec-tionism through regional trade agreements and through the artifices of standards, anti-dumping and safeguards. All parties have contributed to the disappointment produced by the Doha Round. There has been a lack of ambitious trade reformers, among both the developed and the developing countries, capable of producing liberalizing initiatives to break the numerous impasses en-dured throughout the negotiations.
