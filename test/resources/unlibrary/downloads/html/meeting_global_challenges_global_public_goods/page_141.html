A car-bon tax produces a double dividend: reduced carbon emissions and increased revenues. Five countries have implemented a national carbon tax: Finland, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden. New Zealand will soon also introduce a national carbon tax. Substantial benefits could be realized by the use of carbon taxes in all states at agreed levels based on the principle of common but dif-ferentiated responsibility, and we urge governments to consider their adoption. They could contribute towards the financing of critically im-portant global public goods. And they could do much to mitigate global warming by reducing emissions and redirecting resources towards the development of alternative energy sources. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="195.42" top="297.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="297.8" x1="195.42" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.15; y0: 297.8; y1: 307.8; width: 6.49; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Summing up </span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.3" top="269.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="269.65" x1="413.3" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 135.99; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">If the sphere of inter-state cooperation is currently rather gloomy, it is inspiring to see the level of energy and innovation emanating from the growing engagement of private and civil society actors&#8212;actors, more-over, who do not cleave to regional and political divisions that erode the prospects for cooperation among states. Innovative partnerships be- tween such actors and governments are likely to be an ever more im-portant part of the process by which global public goods are financed. Indeed, this innovation and energy is an uplifting note on which to wrap up our analysis. Of course highlighting this innovation does not mean that the fun- damental responsibility of states is to be neglected. States remain re-sponsible to their citizens and to one another for the global effects of national policy and for mutual cooperation to solve global problems. One way for states to act on that responsibility is to embrace in-novative and ambitious efforts to generate new sources of financing for </span></div></body></html>
