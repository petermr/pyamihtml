One is that companies have not been subject to adequate scrutiny and so have evaded payments to which governments were entitled. The other is that public officials have diverted payments that should have gone into the budget into improper uses. For both, trans-parency in reporting payments makes scrutiny more feasible. The EITI is a modest start, but could usefully be strengthened and extended to other natural resource sectors, such as forestry and fisheries.</span><span x0="372.88" y0="525.96" x1="381.57" style="x0: 372.88; x1: 375.74; y0: 525.96; y1: 531.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">113</span></div><div left="147.66" right="410.5" top="507.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="507.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.43; y0: 507.65; y1: 517.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Another mechanism warranting deeper use is peer review. Pio-neered (at the international level) by the OECD and recently adopted by the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) and the new UN Human Rights Council, peer-review processes have the ad-vantages of being equitable, by definition, and of reinforcing a sense of partnership and cooperation. A disadvantage is that peer-review mecha-nisms can create mutual interest among parties in each having the other down-play reports of violations, non-compliance and so on. Another alternative is independent national mechanisms reporting on their own states&#8217; performance. The US General Accounting Office has access to both open-source and confidential government docu-mentation, as well as powers to subpoena information. Its reports are highly credible and provide a solid, independent base of information to judge government performance. The advantage of national mechanisms is political: national constituencies are more likely to mobilize around independent national reporting than international reporting. National reports can be cumulated at the regional or international level to pro- vide an overview of state performance.All four mechanisms can usefully be complemented by academic and NGO-based monitoring. Human rights organizations have set a high benchmark here, providing across-the-board monitoring of states&#8217; human rights performance on an independent basis. Increasing use of similar reporting in the peace and security area&#8212;for example, by the International Crisis Group&#8212;is already proving beneficial in stimulating national accountability for states&#8217; performance. In international negotiations, governments should adopt formal monitoring mechanisms to accompany international agreements.</span></div><div left="132.66" right="224.87" top="115.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="115.65" x1="224.87" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.22; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Evaluating performance</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.26" top="87.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="87.65" x1="413.26" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.58; y0: 87.65; y1: 97.65; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Using evidence-based research for policy-making and monitoring state compliance will provide important benchmarks for conducting proper </span></div></body></html>
