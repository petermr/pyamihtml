The goal of ABST would be to facilitate the transfer of scien-tific knowledge and technological information to developing countries. Through ABST developed countries would be committed to support poor countries in enhancing their capacity to assimilate, diffuse and generate knowledge. With the necessary safeguards ABST would adopt regimes to allow researchers from all countries to compete for local research grants and for increasing global access to research outcomes. These regimes should be built on the most-favoured-nation and national treatment principles.</span></div></body></html>
