There is a generalized sense in political discourse that only the post-war powers meaningfully participate in governance decisions. Yet Asia has growing financial, political and mili-tary clout. Africa is creating new opportunities for itself. And several states, including in East Asia and Latin America, have grown so much in size and regional reach that weaknesses in their formal decision-making roles im-pedes the implementation of international programmes and mandates. We believe that an approach based on the requirements of produc-ing global public goods can be useful in providing pathways to reform. What our report shows is that the very nature of global public goods requires a combination of responsible leadership by those states that have extensive financial and political capacity to contribute, as well as a wider process of legitimization, reflecting state preferences and coor-dinating interests. Unless those with financial and political power are willing to shoul-der their responsibilities, no international institution is able to perform its basic mandate. From the outset of our current system, the notion that powerful states should have extra responsibilities has been embedded in institutional governance. But the current architecture lacks mechanisms to modify the nature of representation in governance mechanisms as power and capability shift. Across the board we believe that international institutions would be strengthened with integrated mechanisms to modify their gover-nance arrangements as state capabilities shifted, including, for example, weighted voting (linked to contributions and population) or linking membership to specific contributions. With respect to the core mandate of the institution in question, different measurements could be adopted, encompassing percentage of world GDP, scale of financial transactions, share of peacekeeping contributions and so on. Obviously if such measures are adopted, great debate will be ex-pended over precisely which measures of capacity to contribute to use. We believe that approaches that involve flexible participation based on specific capacity are preferable, because they create incentives for ac-tion and rewards for contributions, encouraging national commitments rather than simply rewarding status. Weighted voting is one such mecha-nism. Another, adopted by the World Bank&#8217;s International Development Association and the UN in creating the Peacebuilding Commission, is having seats at the table that reflect sustained contributions as well as the more traditional standard of regional representation.</span></div></body></html>
