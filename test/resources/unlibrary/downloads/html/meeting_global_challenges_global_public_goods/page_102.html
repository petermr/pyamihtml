But we cannot stress enough that such a catalytic forum must be matched to&#8212;indeed it must strengthen and make more effective&#8212;for- mal institutions and the wider process of negotiation and decision-mak-ing they allow. This process is necessary to ensure that all states have a chance to express their preferences and participate in the authoriza-tion, or rejection, of action, even if the direction is initially set by the Global 25. That the legitimacy of the decision-making mechanisms of the major international institutions is in doubt poses a major obstacle to this process, one requiring structural reform.
