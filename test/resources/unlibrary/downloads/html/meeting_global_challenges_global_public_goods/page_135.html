More recently with the entry into force of the Kyoto Pro-tocol and the creation of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, a market for carbon dioxide emissions permits has emerged and several trading exchanges across Europe have been created. The Kyoto Protocol fur-thermore allows for mechanisms that permit richer countries to offset their carbon dioxide emissions against the emissions prevented when technology that reduces greenhouse gas emissions is deployed in poor countries.Another example is the use of advance market commitments, which have been under discussion in the G-8 since Gleneagles in 2005&#8212;namely the use of official and charitable funds to guarantee a minimum price and volume for the purchase of a vaccine. This mecha- nism creates incentives for the private sector to invest in medical re-search. By limiting the risks associated with an uncertain market, this helps to motivate significant R&amp;D investments necessary in producing certain vaccines, especially those required to tackle infectious diseases in the developing world. The growing depth and breadth of financial markets have led to market actors offering instruments that governments can use to manage their risks. Such instruments include growth-indexed sovereignty bonds, which provide issuing countries with an insurance policy to reduce debt service obligations to bond holders if economic performance stalls. An-other example is futures and options, which help mitigate the challenges of commodity price volatility. Market-based approaches could be expanded to address global issues, in particular in the areas of health, environmental services and knowl-edge. This requires the involvement of public sector actors to provide the necessary regulatory framework.</span></div><div left="132.66" right="270.98" top="157.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="157.8" x1="270.98" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.07; y0: 157.8; y1: 167.8; width: 7.41; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">How?
