For example, 90% of the world economy is held by 20 states, whose common action is necessary for financial stability. When the governing mechanisms of institutions engage the states necessary for solutions, institutional decision-making can be efficient, but in the absence of governance reforms to match evolving realities, this is now seldom the case. Moreover, there is a broader issue in that however few states are in-volved in producing a global public good, by definition all will consume it, often in ways that are at odds with national economic and political interests. This creates a need for all (or most) states to have some voice in the articulation and decision-making around global public goods.Most global public goods fall between two extremes: one requiring all states&#8217; involvement, and the other requiring action only by a few. In such circumstances decision-making through the governing mechanisms of international institutions should be an efficient way to reach decisions. However the perceived legitimacy of the governing mechanisms of insti-tutions is crucial. Where legitimacy is present, many states will accept the good; where not, it will generate resistance and non-compliance. Gov-erning mechanisms that engage responsible states and are broadly seen as legitimate are thus crucial in the provision of global public goods.A second feature of institutions is that they can serve as repositories of analytical and operational capacity. This is particularly so for the IMF and the World Bank and the UN specialized agencies, such as the WHO, the IAEA and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organiza-tion (UNESCO), all of which have substantial repositories of specialized  capacity. The quality of that capacity is highly variable, of course, partially because of a lack of clear accountability for many of these institutions. It is important to improve this specialized capacity. Measured against the option of each state involved maintaining its own separate capacity to tackle problems with transnational reach, regional and international institutions can have significant efficiencies. Imagine the inefficiencies if every state sought to maintain a global natural disaster response capacity or a global infectious disease surveillance system. Moreover, interna-tional institutions, because of their global reach, end up engaged in far more cases than their national counterparts, enabling deeper learning and the development of core skills.But there are significant weaknesses to these institutions as well. Centralization of activity among international organizations will work well only if they are made more accountable to their members and for </span></div></body></html>
