Other countries that have agreed to participate are Brazil, Congo, C&#710;ote d&#8217;Ivoire, Cyprus, Gabon, Jordan, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Mauritius, Nicaragua, Norway and the United Kingdom. According to early estimates, the contribution from this mechanism in France alone will generate up to 200 million Euros annually. All other countries of the initiative will raise approximately the same amount as a group. The United Kingdom, which already raises $1.8 billion a year from the taxation of commercial flights, has committed to allocate a percentage of this revenue to the initiative. The introduction of airline ticket contributions is expected to pro- vide stable and predictable resources to, inter alia, help cover the recur-rent costs of health programmes in developing countries. Some of the revenue will be used to fund purchases of medical products, mainly antiretroviral treatment of HIV/AIDS. The levy would be collected by airlines, established nationally through voluntary coordination between nations and monitored and enforced nationally&#8212;a rare example of an internationally coordinated, long-term fund-raising mechanism.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="353.65" x1="263.62" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.66; y0: 353.65; y1: 363.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">The International Finance Facility for Immunization. </span><span x0="262.38" y0="353.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 262.38; x1: 269.15; y0: 353.65; y1: 363.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The other innova-tive financing mechanism currently being introduced is the IFFim. It is a pilot version of the International Finance Facility (IFF) which was proposed by the British government. Essentially participants in the IFF would be required to make a legally binding long-term commitment. With this commitment the IFF can raise money immediately on the international capital markets by issuing bonds, which the participants are obliged to pay as they mature some 8&#8211;15 years into the future. Basi-cally the IFF would &#8220;frontload&#8221; the flow of aid and thereby make more resources available today for development, including measures needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.</span><span x0="231.7" y0="217.96" x1="241.8" style="x0: 231.7; x1: 234.56; y0: 217.96; y1: 223.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">144 </span><span x0="241.66" y0="213.65" x1="337.7" style="x0: 241.66; x1: 248.43; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">To pilot this scheme the UK and France launched the IFFim in November 2004.</span><span x0="283.7" y0="203.96" x1="292.21" style="x0: 283.7; x1: 286.55; y0: 203.96; y1: 209.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">145</span><span x0="295.7" y0="199.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 295.7; x1: 302.05; y0: 199.65; y1: 209.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">By apply-ing the IFF principles on a small scale for a specific effort&#8212;improving access to immunization&#8212;the sponsors want to demonstrate how the facility could be a suitable instrument to help finance critical health pro-grammes. The IFFim will borrow nearly $4 billion on the international capital markets for immediate disbursement, using the donors&#8217; commit-ment of future payment as a way to generate more money upfront. The money will be used to support new and underused vaccines and to strengthen immunization services to combat diseases that cause a signifi- cant proportion of child mortality (starting with DTP-Hepatitis B).</span></div></body></html>
