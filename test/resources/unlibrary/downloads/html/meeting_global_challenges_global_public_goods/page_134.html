A response to coordinating the many ca-pacity-building initiatives in the area of trade, it aims to share information, monitor the implementation of agreed commitments and identify critical gaps. A similar capacity database or clearing house should be encouraged in each global public good area.</span></div><div left="57.1" right="221.63" top="493.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="493.65" x1="221.63" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.08; y0: 493.65; y1: 503.65; width: 6.98; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">The energy of the market and civil society </span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.75" top="465.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="465.65" x1="337.75" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.5; y0: 465.65; y1: 475.65; width: 7.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Governments can also do more to tap into the energy of the market and civil society.  Civil society and the private sector are playing an ever more im-portant role in providing international finance. While the traditional multilateral organizations are still the major channels for cross-border cooperation, the number of international financing mechanisms has increased dramatically. By one estimate the number of international financing mechanisms that contribute to meeting global challenges, in-cluding investment funds and philanthropic contributions, amount to some 900&#8211;1,000.</span><span x0="124.88" y0="343.96" x1="133.45" style="x0: 124.88; x1: 127.74; y0: 343.96; y1: 349.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">136</span><span x0="136.21" y0="339.65" x1="337.72" style="x0: 136.21; x1: 141.84; y0: 339.65; y1: 349.65; width: 5.63; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Perhaps most prominent among these is the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in the area of communicable diseases, with grant payments in 2005 totalling $1.4 billion,</span><span x0="237.96" y0="315.96" x1="246.53" style="x0: 237.96; x1: 240.82; y0: 315.96; y1: 321.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">137</span><span x0="249.69" y0="311.65" x1="337.71" style="x0: 249.69; x1: 253.02; y0: 311.65; y1: 321.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">roughly equivalent to the WHO&#8217;s annual budget</span><span x0="158.74" y0="301.96" x1="167.31" style="x0: 158.74; x1: 161.59; y0: 301.96; y1: 307.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">138</span><span x0="167.31" y0="297.65" x1="337.69" style="x0: 167.31; x1: 177.31; y0: 297.65; y1: 307.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">&#8212;now likely to increase substantially given the major donation to the foundation from Warren Buffet. And just as individual governments are entering public-private part- nerships at the national level, non-state actors are joining up with inter-national organizations. By one estimate the number of public-private partnerships contributing to global public goods provision and foreign aid has increased from 35 in 1990 to at least 400 in 2005.</span><span x0="282.64" y0="217.96" x1="291.21" style="x0: 282.64; x1: 285.49; y0: 217.96; y1: 223.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">139</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.67" top="199.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="199.65" x1="337.67" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 81.27; y0: 199.65; y1: 209.65; width: 9.17; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Markets are central to generating the scale of resources required to meet the global challenges identified in this report. And they offer the double dividend of enhanced efficiency and freeing up government re-sources. Public policy has a key role to play in ensuring that markets are created and that they are used to their full potential. Governments es- tablish regulatory frameworks&#8212;by setting standards and assigning prop-erty rights&#8212;and create incentives. Existing market instruments offer governments tools to redress market failures in the provision of global public goods. One example of the emerging use of market mechanisms is in the </span></div></body></html>
