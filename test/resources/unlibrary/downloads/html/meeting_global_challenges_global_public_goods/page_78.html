For one thing, the GATT itself (Article XXIV) allows for preferen-tial trade agreements, which in recent years have mushroomed to almost 200, and in many instances can impede global trade rather than promote it. The system also lacks the proper means to discipline instruments such as standards, anti-dumping and safeguards that are frequently used for outright, arbitrary and discriminatory protectionism.</span><span x0="275.88" y0="511.96" x1="281.6" style="x0: 275.88; x1: 278.74; y0: 511.96; y1: 517.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">79</span><span x0="283.9" y0="507.65" x1="337.71" style="x0: 283.9; x1: 289.21; y0: 507.65; y1: 517.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Furthermore important sectors remain outside the general principles and disciplines of the system. For more than 50 years under various derogations from GATT rules&#8212;most recently under the Multifibre Agreement (MFA) phased out only on 1 January 2005&#8212;trade in textiles and clothing was subject to quotas. To this day in many countries, trade in these products continues to be restricted by high tariffs and even quantitative restric-tions allowed by some transitory WTO provisions. Even more anomalous than the textiles and clothing case has been the treatment of agriculture. This sector was brought into the legal framework of the multilateral trading system only in 1994 as a result of the Uruguay Round. This long-overdue step happened, however, with-out any meaningful liberalization of farm trade, which has continued to be affected by massive subsidies for farm production in rich countries and enormous market access barriers (tariffs and others) applied by both developed and developing countries.Interestingly in the Uruguay Round, in order to get the agreement to phase out the MFA and to bring agriculture into the WTO system, developing countries had to accept bringing intellectual property pro- tection&#8212;clearly a non-trade issue&#8212;into the WTO&#8217;s jurisdiction.The system has thus permitted greater protectionism in products of significant export interest for developing countries. The provisions allowing for special and differential treatment for these countries, and the trade preferences granted by developed countries, do not compen-sate in any meaningful way for the trading opportunities missed as a consequence of the remaining protectionism. Objectively, the system is unbalanced against the interests of developing countries.</span></div><div left="57.1" right="195.28" top="115.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="115.65" x1="195.28" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.08; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 6.98; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">The breakdown of the Doha Round</span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="87.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="87.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.45; y0: 87.65; y1: 97.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Balancing the system to make it more supportive of developing coun-tries&#8217; development was a core objective of the Doha Round&#8212;dubbed </span></div></body></html>
