At the international level significant investments have been made in the free exchange of scientific research findings and results, in some cases supported by public funding, including such international research part- nerships as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Re-search (CGIAR) and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. Another example is the European Organization for Nuclear Research (known as CERN).</span><span x0="101.41" y0="497.96" x1="107.09" style="x0: 101.41; x1: 104.26; y0: 497.96; y1: 503.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">91</span></div><div left="73.26" right="334.93" top="479.65"><span x0="73.26" y0="479.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 73.26; x1: 80.03; y0: 479.65; y1: 489.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">All these initiatives produce scientific breakthroughs and new knowl-edge available to all. Similarly, we emphasize the importance of further efforts to ensure that statistics delivered by governments and compiled or collected by international institutions are openly available. Both systems&#8212;intellectual property and common knowledge&#8212;are needed, but there is no neat formula indicating how much of one rela-tive to the other is desirable. During the past 20 years, the balance between the two kinds of systems has been tilting towards private intel-lectual property. The European Union has adopted a highly restrictive directive on the protection of databases. The United States has ex- panded the scope of patentable research findings, including what oth-erwise would be considered discoveries of nature rather than inventions. And other developed nations have moved to protect business software, plant and animal varieties, genetic sequences and biotechnological re- search tools.</span><span x0="105.16" y0="287.96" x1="110.87" style="x0: 105.16; x1: 108.02; y0: 287.96; y1: 293.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">92</span><span x0="113.6" y0="283.65" x1="337.69" style="x0: 113.6; x1: 119.95; y0: 283.65; y1: 293.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">By far, and somewhat ironically, the most important step to protect intellectual property rights has taken place on the multilateral front with the adoption of the TRIPS agreement. These and other changes in the intellectual property system have resulted in a relative contraction of the common knowledge platform. The knowledge gap between the rich countries and the majority of poor countries is widening and with it the possibilities are reduced of closing the development gap between them. Furthermore the role of knowledge as an input for the production of other global public goods is also being limited by the protection of intellectual property as clearly exemplified by the cases of R&amp;D for disease control and climate change.</span><span x0="87.12" y0="133.96" x1="92.83" style="x0: 87.12; x1: 89.97; y0: 133.96; y1: 139.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">93</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.56" top="115.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="115.65" x1="337.56" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.87; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The Task Force strongly endorses two types of initiatives. First, those aimed to enhance the common knowledge platform through interna-tional partnerships. Specifically donor countries should expand their financial commitments to enhance the global research and informa-</span></div></body></html>
