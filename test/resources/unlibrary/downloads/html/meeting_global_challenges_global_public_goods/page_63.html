National health systems of many developing coun-tries need injections not only of financing, but also of human resources for medical practitioners, administrators and outreach. If the national health systems of poor or fragile countries are not strengthened, all efforts to combat infectious disease will be in vain. The WHO reported recently that, despite the growth of the global population, numbers of health workers are falling or static in the most critical countries. It estimates that more than four million addi-tional doctors, nurses, midwives, managers and public health workers are needed to provide essential services and fill the knowledge gap.</span><span x0="404.7" y0="399.96" x1="410.5" style="x0: 404.7; x1: 407.55; y0: 399.96; y1: 405.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">41</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.25" top="381.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="381.65" x1="413.25" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.43; y0: 381.65; y1: 391.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">A recent study also estimated that Sub-Saharan Africa, to reach the MDG target of 2.5 health workers per 1,000 population, would need to add one million health workers by 2015.</span><span x0="310.54" y0="357.96" x1="316.35" style="x0: 310.54; x1: 313.4; y0: 357.96; y1: 363.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">42</span></div><div left="147.66" right="413.24" top="339.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="339.65" x1="413.24" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 150.99; y0: 339.65; y1: 349.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">In recent years, international programmes have been established to raise funds to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, includ- ing the International Finance Facility for Immunization, Global Alli-ance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. But these disease-specific vertical programmes can drain public health systems of needed human resources in basic services. And the coordination among them and with such international organizations as the WHO and the World Bank remains weak. This strains develop- ing countries&#8217; already limited capabilities.</span><span x0="300.75" y0="217.96" x1="306.52" style="x0: 300.75; x1: 303.6; y0: 217.96; y1: 223.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">43</span><span x0="308.51" y0="213.65" x1="413.27" style="x0: 308.51; x1: 315.28; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The shift to such vertical programmes has also meant that attention and resources have been di-verted away from horizontal (or sector-wide) capacity building. More support for horizontal capacity building, or greater attention to na-tional capacity building within vertical programmes, is needed. This should be pursued under the joint leadership of the WHO and the World Bank.</span><span x0="184.35" y0="133.96" x1="190.13" style="x0: 184.35; x1: 187.21; y0: 133.96; y1: 139.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">44</span></div><div left="147.66" right="226.53" top="115.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="115.65" x1="226.53" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 150.89; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 3.23; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Increasing knowledge. </span><span x0="224.8" y0="115.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 224.8; x1: 231.57; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The dearth of research for preventing infectious disease and containing epidemics in tropical countries is astounding.
