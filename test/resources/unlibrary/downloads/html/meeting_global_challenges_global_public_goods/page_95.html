It is essential to ensure additional funding for the institutions already conducting research in these areas, particularly the CGIAR and the various partnerships in the medical sectors. On health, serious con- sideration should be given to the creation of new partnerships, pref-erably a network of research facilities specializing in tropical diseases, guided and financed through an International Consultative Group, as suggested in chapter 3. Second, the Task Force endorses initiatives aimed to balance the ef-fects of TRIPS on developing countries. As mentioned above, accepting TRIPS was the cost paid by developing countries to have the Multifibre Agreement phased out and agriculture brought into the WTO frame-work. It has been estimated that developing countries eventually will be paying close to $60 billion per year in royalties because of the enforce- ment of TRIPS.</span><span x0="197.16" y0="413.96" x1="202.87" style="x0: 197.16; x1: 200.01; y0: 413.96; y1: 419.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">94</span><span x0="206.14" y0="409.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 206.14; x1: 211.04; y0: 409.65; y1: 419.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Some of this cost was supposed to be compensated by the expected benefits stemming from the protection of intellectual property rights, benefits such as increased trade, additional technology transfers and bigger foreign investment flows including the flows di- rected to address specific needs of developing countries&#8212;like combat-ing tropical diseases. The problem is that TRIPS is a bound obligation, whereas the supposed compensating benefits are not. Thus, as is found in other parts of the multilateral trading system, TRIPS is unbalanced against the interests of developing countries. One measure to balance the consequences of TRIPS, albeit only partially, would be the establishment of a multilateral agreement on open access to basic science and technology (ABST).</span><span x0="341.54" y0="259.96" x1="347.26" style="x0: 341.54; x1: 344.4; y0: 259.96; y1: 265.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">95</span></div><div left="147.66" right="413.26" top="241.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="241.65" x1="413.26" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.43; y0: 241.65; y1: 251.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The ABST could have at least five globally beneficial impacts. First, it would help resolve the free-rider problems that reduce investments in science and technology relative to a global optimum. Second, it could restrain the tendency of governments to restrict access and to encourage privatization of basic knowledge. This rebalancing of technology develop-ment norms in favour of expanding the public domain could help vitalize scientific research in many countries while promoting applied innovation. Third, the agreement could provide an important plank for the construc- tion of modern technological capabilities in poor countries while sustain-ing access to information for educational purposes. Fourth, it should not unduly restrict the rights of firms to exploit intellectual property in ap-plied technologies and products. Finally, it could help restore confidence on the part of developing countries that TRIPS and the WTO are institu-</span></div></body></html>
