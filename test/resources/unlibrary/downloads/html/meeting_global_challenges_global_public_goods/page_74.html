Stronger macroeconomic, fi-nancial and exchange rate policies are critical for both developing and developed countries. For example, the sustainability of the US current account and fiscal imbalances&#8212;and the capital inflows that finance them&#8212;pose major risks of a disorderly adjustment that would rever-berate throughout global financial markets. It is essential that the IMF ensures even-handed treatment on exchange-rate monitoring and other surveillance issues of all member countries, including very large ones.</span><span x0="326.88" y0="441.96" x1="332.57" style="x0: 326.88; x1: 329.74; y0: 441.96; y1: 447.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">69</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.66" top="423.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="423.65" x1="337.66" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.41; y0: 423.65; y1: 433.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">For developed countries the priority is to promote strong and stable growth through sound, sustainable and appropriately coordinated mon-etary, fiscal and exchange rate policies. For emerging-market economies the priorities are to adhere to sustainable debt and fiscal management and exchange rate policies to reduce the risk of crisis, avoid the buildup of excessive net foreign liabilities (especially short term, whether in official or private accounts), ensure transparency and adhere to agreed standards and codes. These economies must also pursue adequate social policies to make growth more inclusive. Long-run stability requires so-cial and political sustainability. The IMF Managing Director&#8217;s proposal to introduce a new pro-cedure for multilateral surveillance at the IMF and to promote debate on issues of systemic importance should be supported. He argues that there is not enough substantive debate to resolve global macroeco- nomic problems.</span><span x0="124.02" y0="231.96" x1="129.73" style="x0: 124.02; x1: 126.88; y0: 231.96; y1: 237.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">70</span><span x0="131.78" y0="227.65" x1="337.69" style="x0: 131.78; x1: 138.55; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The Fund&#8217;s special procedure for bringing pressing problems to the fore outside the regular Article IV consultations with member countries is rarely used, partly for the stigma of being singled out. The new procedure would allow the Fund to take up issues with important members and even with entities, such as regional group-ings, that are not members. An enhanced focus on regional surveillance within the Fund would complement this initiative.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="129.65" x1="147.16" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 79.39; y0: 129.65; y1: 139.65; width: 7.29; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Crisis management. </span><span x0="148.75" y0="129.65" x1="337.57" style="x0: 148.75; x1: 155.52; y0: 129.65; y1: 139.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Three mechanisms have dominated the crisis management debate in recent years; progress is needed on each front. First is sovereign debt rescheduling and restructuring among bond- holders. The challenge here is to secure an agreement among independ-ent creditors who may benefit collectively from an agreement but suffer </span></div></body></html>
