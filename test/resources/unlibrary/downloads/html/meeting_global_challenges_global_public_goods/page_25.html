Similarly, national governments bear the primary respon-sibility for ensuring that financing needs for global public goods are met through direct public funding and appropriate incentives and regulatory frameworks that stimulate private funding and the use of market mechanisms. Nations will gain major benefits by increasing their expenditure on global public goods. Initial cost-benefit analyses of various global public goods confirm that money spent on providing them can produce sig-nificant savings compared to the cost of dealing with the ills that arise when such goods are not provided, including financial shocks, spread of new diseases, nuclear proliferation crises and so on. Indeed past experi-ence demonstrates very high benefit-cost ratios for global public goods. This suggests that significant additional expenditures on global public goods are well justified.We are, however, concerned that increased financing for global public goods could crowd out traditional development assistance. Most donor countries have few funding sources to pay for global public goods activities in developing countries, except for those that can be consid-ered to fall within official development assistance (ODA). For instance, money spent on building public health capacity in developing coun-tries will have development results and will also contribute to global </span></div></body></html>
