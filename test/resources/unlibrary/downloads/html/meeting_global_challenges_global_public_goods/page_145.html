Rather, it will take patient, sustained efforts over time. Moving forward in this direction requires action from all sectors: government and private, including civil society, and national, regional and international. The net result would be an international system more able to supply global public goods&#8212;an international system, in other words, less divided and more concerted in its action, more capable of joint, global action and less vulnerable to global ills. A good, surely, to be desired by all. </span></div></body></html>
