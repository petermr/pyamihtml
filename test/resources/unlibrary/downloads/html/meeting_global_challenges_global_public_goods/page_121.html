Even here, however, we should be aware of bias. International institutions tend to engage in research that takes as an assumption the relevance of that institutions&#8217; policy tools and instruments. As a result institutional research should be supplemented by inde- pendent scholarly research and assessment.</span><span x0="305.7" y0="539.96" x1="315.96" style="x0: 305.7; x1: 308.56; y0: 539.96; y1: 545.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">110 </span><span x0="316.66" y0="535.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 316.66; x1: 325.83; y0: 535.65; y1: 545.65; width: 9.17; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">More generally the es-tablishment of a research network across a range of issues to promote independent research into global public goods would add value.

Governments often agree to international solutions that contain no provision for monitoring their compliance with obligations. Without monitoring it is impossible to design incentives for performance or sanctions. Here again we stress that if governments are not willing to relinquish some sovereign controls and provide institutions with the relevant authority to monitor their own compliance, they will seldom succeed in solving critical global challenges. When international agreements contain provisions for mon-itoring compliance, the odds of success rise significantly. Any systems of monitoring compliance have to be both indepen- dent and equitable. Any that are selective are doomed to political fail-ure. All states have responsibility for the production of global public goods and an interest in their achievements. Thus all states&#8217; performance should be monitored on an equal basis. Transparent monitoring and reporting are critical for mobilizing public opinion and for accountability&#8212;both before agreements are reached and during implementation. They are particularly useful in identifying free riders. At present, monitoring of country performance is decidedly limited and uneven. Among international organizations, only the IMF systematically monitors country performance through its Article IV Consultations, reflecting its findings in the </span><span x0="368.04" y0="115.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 368.04; x1: 377.62; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 9.58; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">World Eco-nomic Outlook </span><span x0="190.02" y0="101.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 190.02; x1: 193.98; y0: 101.65; y1: 111.65; width: 3.96; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">and other publications.
