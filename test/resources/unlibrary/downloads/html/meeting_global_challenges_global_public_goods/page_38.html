The basic result is a negative cycle of underinvest-ment in, and underperformance by, international mechanisms. Efforts to tackle the institutional symptoms of these changes without address- ing the underlying causes have unsurprisingly met with underwhelm-ing results. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="117.08" top="465.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="465.8" x1="117.08" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.59; y0: 465.8; y1: 475.8; width: 6.49; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Summing up</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.75" top="437.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="437.65" x1="337.75" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 437.65; y1: 447.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The hard reality is that the current political climate is inauspicious for improving the quality and quantity of international cooperation. However no one can afford to sit idly by and wait for change. Fail-ure to revitalize international cooperation, particularly during troubled periods, will at the very least cause the loss of important opportuni-ties to galvanize efforts towards tackling climate change, to deepen the battle against disease, to advance knowledge in ways that can reap as yet unforeseen benefits and to prevent old and new manifestations of vio-lent conflict. Every year that passes with reforms unattained increases their difficulty and their cost. Left unattended, the current erosion in support for international cooperation risks generating a negative spiral of protectionism, iso-lationism and deepening international divisions, eroding both global prosperity and stability. </span></div></body></html>
