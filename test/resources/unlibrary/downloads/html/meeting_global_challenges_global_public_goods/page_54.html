Similarly, in UN peacekeeping, states that contribute troops are provided with a financial incentive tied to the scale of participation. This is inadequate to fully compensate for the costs of troops from the wealthiest states, but adequate to compensate and create incentives for less developed countries. Without such incentives, successes in combat-ing erosion of the ozone layer or in reducing the level of civil war could not have been accomplished. But just as international institutions currently operate under a shroud of scepticism, so national governments increasingly have dif- ficulty in persuading domestic constituencies of the value of spend-ing national resources on international action. If adequate financing for global public goods is to be realized, governments will have to convince sceptical publics that they have made reforms to ensure bet-ter use of existing resources; will have to innovate; and will have to create the right set of incentives to mobilize and harness the private sector, which has much to gain from and much to contribute to well-organized international cooperation. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="110.79" top="311.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="311.8" x1="110.79" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.51; y0: 311.8; y1: 321.8; width: 7.41; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Conclusion</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.65" top="283.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="283.65" x1="337.65" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 67.1; y0: 283.65; y1: 293.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">We define global public goods as ones available for all to consume and ones whose benefits in principle can be enjoyed by the governments and people of each state without impinging on the enjoyment of oth-ers. The sphere of global public goods with which we are concerned is delineated by issues that are broadly conceived as important to the international community; that, for the most part, cannot or will not be adequately addressed by individual countries acting alone; and that are defined through a broad international consensus or a legitimate process of decision-making. We recognize that much of the action required to provide global public goods takes place at the national level. But the most intransigent obstacles arise at the international level, in the very structure of inter-national cooperation between independent, sovereign states. Historically the supply of global public goods has required three critical factors. It requires the catalytic action that responsible leadership can provide, as the outcome of advance commitments by influential </span></div></body></html>
