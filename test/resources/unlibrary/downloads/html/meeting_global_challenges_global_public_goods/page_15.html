Its long-term consequences will likely be severe. The most efficient response is to broaden the use of carbon taxes, which would both re-duce emissions of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas, and generate revenues to pay for global public goods. There currently is a reluctance to consider the international adoption of carbon taxes. Hopefully this reluctance will be overcome in the future. In the mean-time the international community should not settle for less than the following four priority strategies:</span><span x0="147.79" y0="100.72" x1="157.41" style="x0: 147.79; x1: 152.74; y0: 100.72; y1: 114.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.79" y0="101.65" x1="413.23" style="x0: 168.79; x1: 174.73; y0: 101.65; y1: 111.65; width: 5.94; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Emissions caps and trade&#8212;Governments should agree on technology-forcing targets and timetables as well as a cap-and-trade scheme to control emissions.
