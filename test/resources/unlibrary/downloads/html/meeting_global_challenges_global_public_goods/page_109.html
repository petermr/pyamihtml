The mandate of such a grouping should be limited to political debate and agreement and not extended to formal decision-making. Any political agreements reached by the Global 25 that relate to the mandate of a formal multilateral insti-tution should be taken back to it for formal debate within its governing mechanisms and for acceptance or rejection by the wider membership. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="227.25" top="493.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="493.65" x1="227.25" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.89; y0: 493.65; y1: 503.65; width: 8.23; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Options for composition</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.29" top="465.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="465.65" x1="413.29" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 137.56; y0: 465.65; y1: 475.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Since the idea of a heads of state and government meeting of the G-20, or a variant,</span><span x0="180.52" y0="455.96" x1="189.09" style="x0: 180.52; x1: 183.38; y0: 455.96; y1: 461.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">100</span><span x0="192.01" y0="451.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 192.01; x1: 199.41; y0: 451.65; y1: 461.65; width: 7.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">was first floated, there has been a debate over composi-tion. Is the Finance G-20 suited to take on a broader role? Might not alternative models be better? Is it more feasible to start with a narrower grouping, through expanding the G-8 to the G-10 or G-12? Is it more effective to elect a different 20 based on different criteria or to modify the existing 20 based on broader criteria? We see most merit in an approach based on augmenting the exist- ing G-20&#8212;a cross-regional grouping of states that has significant rep-resentation from emerging powers and all continents and regions and that collectively represent around 90% of global gross national product, 80% of world trade and two-thirds of the world&#8217;s population.</span><span x0="376.58" y0="315.96" x1="385.21" style="x0: 376.58; x1: 379.44; y0: 315.96; y1: 321.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">101</span></div><div left="147.66" right="410.5" top="297.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="297.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 153.6; y0: 297.65; y1: 307.65; width: 5.94; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Even then, two sets of actors would be underrepresented, or not repre-sented at all. First are African states, represented in the G-20 only by South Africa. Second are the poorest countries, which have no representation at all in the Finance G-20. Finally while in the Finance G-20 some impor-tant economic institutions are represented (the IMF, the World Bank and the European Central Bank), the UN is not represented. Ideally the composition of a Global 25 would reflect the greatest contributions to global public goods. Given that measurement of such contributions is insufficiently developed, proxy measures for contribu-tion have to be used. Modifications to correct the imbalances in the existing G-20 would improve the representativeness, and thus the likelihood of support for its political agreements. Options for addressing these imbalances include: </span><span x0="147.66" y0="114.72" x1="157.07" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 114.72; y1: 128.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="115.65" x1="413.26" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 175.43; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Add representatives from regional groupings, beginning with the African Union (the European Union is already a member).
