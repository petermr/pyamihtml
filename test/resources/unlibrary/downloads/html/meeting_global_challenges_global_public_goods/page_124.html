Note, for example, that opinion polling finds that the two most important reasons why Americans are sceptical about money spent on international cooperation are that the money does not end up with the needy and there is no monitoring of how money is spent.</span><span x0="321.64" y0="539.96" x1="330.21" style="x0: 321.64; x1: 324.5; y0: 539.96; y1: 545.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">114</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.62" top="521.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="521.65" x1="337.62" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 81.27; y0: 521.65; y1: 531.65; width: 9.17; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Most organizations have established some kind of an evaluation system, such as the World Intellectual Property Organization&#8217;s Internal Audit and Oversight Division, UN&#8217;s Office of the Under-Secretary for Internal Oversight Services, UN Environment Programme&#8217;s (UNEP&#8217;s) internal Evaluation and Oversight Unit and the WHO&#8217;s evaluation of- fice.</span><span x0="73.57" y0="455.96" x1="82.14" style="x0: 73.57; x1: 76.42; y0: 455.96; y1: 461.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">115</span><span x0="83.89" y0="451.65" x1="337.73" style="x0: 83.89; x1: 90.66; y0: 451.65; y1: 461.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">There have been recent attempts to strengthen these evaluation systems, but so far only the IMF and the World Bank have evaluation systems that are independent of management and report directly to their boards. IMF&#8217;s Independent Evaluation Office is perhaps the most independent. Among UN funds, programmes and agencies, and among bilateral agencies, independent evaluation is episodic at best. In the realm of peace and security there is very little evaluation of either policies or initiatives, independent or otherwise. The UN Depart-ment of Peacekeeping Operations has a best-practices section, which now routinely conducts after-action reviews and makes these available publicly. But it is under the managerial responsibility of the department and cannot be seen as independent of the operations it evaluates. Oc-casional use of outside evaluators helps but is inconsistent. And in other areas&#8212;preventive diplomacy, mediation, counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation and disarmament&#8212;there is no culture of evaluation, little empirical research bases and less political will to open up to scrutiny.</span><span x0="323.97" y0="245.96" x1="332.48" style="x0: 323.97; x1: 326.82; y0: 245.96; y1: 251.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">116</span></div><div left="72.1" right="334.93" top="227.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="227.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.87; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The standard for evaluation is set by the public health sector. Al-most all developed country public health systems have strong cultures of policy and intervention evaluation, rigorous independent methodolo-gies for conducting evaluations and a policy culture that looks to the outcome of evaluation when deciding about policy interventions. Cost-benefit analysis is a well established feature of the political and policy process. Even for tough ethical questions, cost-benefit analysis is part of the equation. This clearly strengthens the sector&#8217;s performance and its ability to attract sustained political support and public investment. As part of their reform programmes, international institutions need to set up or upgrade their monitoring and evaluation capacities, includ-ing those for independent evaluation of their own performance on a </span></div></body></html>
