This should be done by a vote at the General Assembly designed to make clear once and for all that attacks on civilians, whatever the context in terms of resistance to foreign occupation or anything else, are absolutely indefensible and comprehensively prohibited. In this content, as in others, the consensus rules of the General Assembly have served not to enhance interna-tional agreement, but to bury accountability. Implementation of this strategy would be aided by independent, evidence-based research into the types, sources and causes of terror-ism. Continued debates about the causes of terrorism, particularly in terms of its relationship to poverty and occupation, impede interna- tional agreement on how to tackle the phenomenon.</span></div><div left="57.1" right="248.49" top="297.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="297.65" x1="248.49" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.45; y0: 297.65; y1: 307.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Preventing the spread and use of nuclear weapons</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.8" top="269.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="269.65" x1="337.8" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 60.43; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">If the international regime for disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons stands as one of the most important accomplish-ments of the multilateral system in the post-Second World War era, its ongoing erosion is the most worrying and most dangerous of contemporary developments (see figure 6.1). The establishment of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its related agen-cies, protocols and control mechanisms helped to deter the spread and thus the risk of use of nuclear weapons for more than 40 years. Alone among weapons, they have the potential to destroy humanity in its entirety. While some of the nuclear weapons states have reduced their stockpiles, others are building them, and remaining stockpiles are more than adequate for the repeated destruction of mankind. No state or person is immune from the risk of use of nuclear weapons or from the potential effects of use. So long as nuclear stockpiles are retained&#8212;both nuclear war-</span></div></body></html>
