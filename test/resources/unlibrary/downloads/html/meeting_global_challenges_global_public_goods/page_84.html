Countries and peoples in every region have been the subject of terrorist attacks just in the years since 11 September 2001. Moreover terrorism directly attacks the separation between civilian and combatant, a concept at the core of international law and norms of war and conflict. Although data about terrorism is notoriously poor, evidence sug-gests that there is a steady increase in &#8220;significant&#8221; terrorist attacks, from 17 in 1987 to more than 170 in 2003.</span><span x0="207.33" y0="483.96" x1="213.04" style="x0: 207.33; x1: 210.18; y0: 483.96; y1: 489.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">83</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.66" top="465.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="465.65" x1="337.66" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.04; y0: 465.65; y1: 475.65; width: 5.94; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Even relatively small-scale terrorist attacks have significant direct and indirect social and economic costs, not only in the country of at-tack. Among them is the rising economic cost associated with enhanced security of trade and transport systems. Trade security systems are rising in cost and complexity&#8212;for example, in ever-more elaborate mecha-nisms for container security. Were a terrorist organization to smuggle a nuclear or biological device into a major port using a container, it is likely that the biggest trading nations would feel compelled to adopt even more stringent container security measures, affecting trade glob-ally. And were a terrorist organization to detonate such a device in a major city, the direct and indirect economic, social and political costs would be both enormous and global. The international regime to combat terrorism has, as it has evolved so far, a number of major elements: </span><span x0="72.1" y0="268.72" x1="81.71" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.05; y0: 268.72; y1: 282.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="93.1" y0="269.65" x1="337.51" style="x0: 93.1; x1: 99.45; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Binding requirements on all states, articulated through UN Security Council Resolutions 1373 and 1540, to combat ter- rorism and proliferation on their own soil.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="226.72" x1="81.71" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.05; y0: 226.72; y1: 240.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="93.1" y0="227.65" x1="337.68" style="x0: 93.1; x1: 99.87; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">An encompassing set of 12 treaties covering specific terrorist action, such as hijacking aeroplanes. </span><span x0="72.1" y0="198.72" x1="81.71" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.05; y0: 198.72; y1: 212.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="93.1" y0="199.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 93.1; x1: 99.87; y0: 199.65; y1: 209.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">A framework for tackling international terrorist financing, ini- tiated by the G-8 and institutionalized at the OECD (Finan-cial Action Task Force on Money Laundering). </span><span x0="72.1" y0="156.72" x1="81.78" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.05; y0: 156.72; y1: 170.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="93.1" y0="157.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 93.1; x1: 98.0; y0: 157.65; y1: 167.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Some international police, intelligence and operational co-ordination, through Interpol and the European Union and through issue-specific collaboration among Interpol, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and the International Atomic Energy Agency.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="86.72" x1="81.71" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.05; y0: 86.72; y1: 100.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="93.1" y0="87.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 93.1; x1: 98.0; y0: 87.65; y1: 97.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Some technical assistance to states to develop counter-terror-ism legislation, organized through a voluntary fund at the UN </span></div></body></html>
