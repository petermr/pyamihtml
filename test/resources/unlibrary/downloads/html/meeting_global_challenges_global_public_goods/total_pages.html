Yet, more and more, those lives are shaped by events, decisions and politics beyond national borders. People pay taxes for local and national healthcare, but some of the gravest threats to health arise from infectious diseases that respect no borders. Among other reasons, people vote for governments on the basis of their economic and fiscal policy, but those policies are heavily constrained by international fi-nancial, trade and investment circumstances. And both people and governments recognize that their &#8220;national&#8221; security is determined in large part by the actions and attitudes of groups and governments far afield.Indeed, the world&#8217;s promise can be realized and its perils restrained only through extensive and ambitious cooperation across borders. Ours is a world of shared risks and common opportunities, grounded in the realities of mutual de- pendence and growing interconnection. All peoples&#8217; health, security and prosper-ity depend in part on the quality of their international cooperation, as does the health of the environment. Because this is so, international cooperation has evolved from being a sphere of interstate negotiations on foreign policy matters to a central part of how gov-ernments and people manage their day-to-day lives. And it has been a powerful and tangible force for progress. Past successes provide solid evidence for what can be achieved in the future. With shared vision and collective action, major accom-plishments can be realized. The spread of infectious diseases can be halted, their effects cured. Climate change can be slowed, its effects mitigated. International terrorism can be deterred, and the use of weapons of mass destruction prevented. These goals are difficult, but achievable. So too is the goal of expanding the prosperity that arises from a combination of peace and security, financial stability and international trade. These global issues pose special challenges. In broad terms the goals are widely shared, and all states have national interests in achieving them; but in most instances no state and no private actor, however rich and powerful, can achieve them alone. Only by acting together, by cooperating across borders, can problems like these be effectively and efficiently addressed.

It is a tool for altruistic purposes, importantly so; and it serves geopolitical interests, certainly. But it is also a tool for states to align their long-term, enlightened national interests to achieve common goals. Some of these goals are &#8220;global public goods&#8221;. Technically, public goods are those that share two rare quali-ties&#8212;non-excludability and non-rivalry, in economists&#8217; jargon. This means, respectively, that when provided to one party, the public good is available to all, and consumption of the public good by one party does not reduce the amount available to the others to consume. Tra-ditional examples of national public goods include traffic control systems and national security&#8212;goods that benefit all citizens and na-tional private actors but that none could manage or supply on their own initiative. Public goods can be regional or global in character, as well as na-tional. There are many cross-border challenges that are more effectively dealt with at the regional or global rather than the national level. Clear examples of regional public goods are the provision of tsunami early-warning systems, the management of river basins and measures to deal with region-specific vulnerabilities created by regional openness&#8212;for example, cross-border transmission of human and animal diseases. The sphere of global public goods we are concerned with is delineated by issues that are broadly conceived as important to the international com-munity, that for the most part cannot or will not be adequately addressed by individual countries acting alone and that are defined through a broad international consensus or a legitimate process of decision-making.Global public goods are those whose benefits could in principle be consumed by the governments and peoples of all states. Examples include mechanisms for ensuring financial stability, the scientific knowledge in-volved in the discovery of a vaccine and international regulations for civil aviation and telecommunications. Once such global standards and systems are established, they are available to all states, and consumption of the good by one state or its people in no way reduces its availability to others. If all states and people can benefit from the provision of global pub-lic goods, it seems logical that they should be easy to supply and should be available in abundance. But the opposite is true. In fact the very na-ture of global public goods means that demand will tend to outweigh </span></div><div left="72.1" right="121.8" top="605.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="605.65" x1="121.8" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.31; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 5.21; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Sovereignty. </span><span x0="121.87" y0="605.65" x1="337.73" style="x0: 121.87; x1: 129.27; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 7.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Governments (or their citizens) are often unwilling to limit or constrain sovereign decision-making, for example by accept-ing binding rules or international monitoring of their own compliance with agreements.

Climate change, for example, impacts differently on different countries, and in the short-term some may even profit from changes to the local climate. Thus the &#8220;good&#8221; in global public goods is often contested.

Although states and their private sectors have different interests and stakes in the international financial system, only the most obstinate of governments fail to recognize that financial shocks are deleterious to all. In the absence of the international trade regime the global economy would sharply contract, and most economies and most people&#8217;s livelihoods would suffer as a result. Perhaps most importantly, all states and populations will lose if there is a further erosion of international peace and security. More positively, investment in global public goods can propel efforts to achieve key development goals. As an example, financial stability is critical to achieving broader economic development. Similarly, improv- ing the international trading system to bring it closer to an actual most-favoured-nation mechanism, eliminating harmful tariffs and subsidies including on agricultural products, will bring substantial development benefits. Of course the achievement of peace and security underlies de-velopment just as development underlies international security. It was for the purpose of elucidating the concept of global public goods, and proposing ways to improve their provision, that this Task Force was created. Our report explains the concept of global public goods using historical evidence; illustrates their importance by high- lighting six priority global issues where their provision is critical; sug-gests broad strategies in those areas for more effectively providing the good in question; and makes more specific recommendations for the kind of structural changes needed at national and international levels. Our report concentrates on the specific challenges posed by the need for international cooperation. This does not negate a recognition that the national level is critical in the provision of global public goods. Indeed we stress the principle of subsidiarity&#8212;solving problems closest to where they occur. But the most enduring difficulties in providing global public goods are found at the international level, and it is at this level that we have been mandated to focus our analysis. At the local and national level the provision of public goods is typi-cally organized by the state, with authority to tax, regulate and even coerce to ensure such provision. At the global level there is no institution with equivalent powers. For good reasons, there is no world government with the authority to tax, to conscript, to regulate or to quarantine. Therefore, at the international level, action to initiate the provision of a public good </span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.69" top="605.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="605.65" x1="337.69" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 61.37; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 4.27; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">constrain their sovereignty, as well as the free-rider problem, voluntarism to trigger the provision of a global public good does not occur easily. Historically it has proven necessary for one or several countries with an enlightened vision and clear sense of responsibility to ignite the processes conducive to the solution of problems that may affect all of humanity.The question is: it is up to whom to play this role in our time? We submit that it is up to the countries that are relatively more prosperous, with larger populations, bigger defence and security capabilities, that have been historically influential and that, typically, have benefited the most from the rule-based multilateral system. These countries have a special responsibility to catalyse action for improving the provision of global public goods. These countries have the responsibility to move first towards goals for the good of everyone, putting forward initiatives for enhancing cooperation and committing resources for their effective realization.

The system has permitted greater protectionism in products of sig- nificant export interest for developing countries. The provisions allow-ing for special and differential treatment for these countries, and the trade preferences granted by developed countries do not compensate in any meaningful way for the trading opportunities missed as a conse- quence of the remaining protectionism. Objectively, the system is un- balanced against the interests of developing countries.Balancing the system to make it more supportive of developing countries&#8217; development was a core objective of the Doha Round&#8212; dubbed for this reason the development agenda&#8212;launched in Novem-ber of 2001. But this sense of purpose was short-lived. In fact, a total suspension of the negotiations for lack of agreement on any of the im-portant issues occurred in July 2006. The main reason for the Doha breakdown is to be found in the agriculture negotiations. The majority of developed countries have re- sisted effective liberalization in farm trade all along. Years of negotia-tions could not make these countries agree on formulas that would effectively open their farm markets to imports and significantly reduce their most distorting farm subsidies. In fact what was brought to the table even up to the very collapse of the talks would have accomplished little to open up agricultural markets and to temper the huge distor-tions caused in those markets by the high subsidies granted by OECD countries to their farmers. The cost of failure in the Doha Round is not only the income op-portunities forgone for both developed and developing countries that its successful conclusion would provide, but more importantly the losses that all will incur if the system is allowed to deteriorate and eventually proves incapable of preventing countries from back-pedaling into protection-ism, as has happened before in history. Despite its achievements, the multilateral trading system is not yet a consolidated global public good. It remains vulnerable to serious erosion by episodes of protectionism. It also has limited capacity to support the integration into the world economy of many countries which have been left on the sidelines of globalization despite formally belonging to the World Trade Organiza- tion (WTO).This Task Force endorses the full resumption of the Doha Round </span></div><div left="132.79" right="413.35" top="605.65"><span x0="132.79" y0="605.65" x1="413.35" style="x0: 132.79; x1: 137.79; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">quo which existed before the suspension of the talks would be a futile and frustrating exercise.

The Quad would not need to grant unilaterally an offer of agricul-tural reform and aid for trade; the Quad could make it conditional upon satisfactory completion of the other key issues included in the Doha Development Agenda. An agreement of this kind among the Quad members most likely would have a powerful catalytic effect on the rest of the WTO membership. Other developed countries resistant until now to remove agricultural barriers would have to reconsider their po-sitions. Large developing countries, that have had in rich countries&#8217; farm protectionism a good reason (or the perfect excuse) for not moving in the negotiations, would also find compromise towards a good agree-ment to be inescapable. Finally, a solvent aid for trade fund would help in bringing other developing countries on board.But the WTO trade negotiators&#8217; capacities can never exceed the mandate received from the governments they represent.

We concur with the UN Secretary-General that in fighting this scourge, five distinct goals have to be pursued simultaneously: dissuade disaffected groups from choos-ing terrorism as a tactic; deny terrorists the means to carry out attacks; deter states from supporting terrorists; develop state capacity to prevent terrorism; and defend human rights in the struggle against terrorism. The pursuit of these goals requires the following operational ele-ments: a protection strategy focused on preventive national security; safeguarding trade and transport routes and ensuring that potential ter-rorists have no access to fissile nuclear material; a strategy for enhancing cooperation among police, intelligence services and, in very extreme cases, military forces; a political strategy to tackle grievances that mani-festly increase domestic support for terrorist actions; a capacity-building strategy to help states develop their own ability to combat terrorism; and a psychological strategy, including the universal adoption, by a vote at the General Assembly, of the definition of terrorism proposed by the UN High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Among other elements, that definition describes terrorism as any action that is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants when the purpose of such an act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population or to compel a government or an interna- tional organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="213.65" x1="251.69" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.73; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 5.63; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Preventing the spread and use of nuclear weapons. </span><span x0="252.15" y0="213.65" x1="337.71" style="x0: 252.15; x1: 258.92; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The establishment of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its related agencies, protocols and control mechanisms constitutes one of the most important accomplishments of the multilateral system.

Political attention to the disarmament agenda has receded, but the threat these weapons pose is growing. These developments are a recipe for mounting risk, possibly disaster.

Once knowledge is generated it can be shared, in principle, by many people at the same time and it is hard for creators of knowledge to maintain exclusive property of it. Hence, if left to market forces alone, there would always be a tendency to underinvest in the generation of knowledge. Knowledge is not only a national public good but a global public good as well, because its diffusion is not stopped by borders. People in any nation could in principle benefit from scientific or technological knowledge produced in other nations. Knowledge is by itself critical for development, at the same time as it serves as an input to the provision of other global public goods. The spontaneous globalization of knowledge does not occur, however, largely because many countries, due to deficiencies in their educational systems, have limited capacity to assimilate existing and new knowledge. Another important barrier to spontaneous globalization is that knowledge has been made to some degree excludable by the adoption of intellectual property rights. The most important step taken recently to protect intel-lectual property rights has occurred on the multilateral front with the </span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="605.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="605.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 61.06; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 3.96; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">adoption of the World Trade Organization&#8217;s Agreement on Trade-Re-lated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). This and other changes in the intellectual property system have resulted in a relative contraction of the common knowledge platform. The knowledge gap between the rich countries and the majority of poor countries is widening and with it the possibilities of closing the development gap between them. Furthermore, the role of knowledge as an input for the production of other global public goods is also being limited by the protection of intellectual property as clearly exemplified by the cases of R&amp;D for disease control and climate change. The Task Force strongly endorses two types of initiatives. First, those aimed to enhance the common knowledge platform through interna-tional partnerships. Specifically, donor countries should expand their financial commitments to enhance the global research and information capabilities necessary to overcome some crucial problems in the areas of rural development, environment and health in the poorest developing countries. It is essential to ensure additional funding for the institutions already conducting research in these areas, particularly the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research and the various partner-ships in the medical sectors. On health, serious consideration should be given to the creation of new partnerships, preferably a network of research facilities specializing in tropical diseases.Second, the Task Force endorses initiatives aimed to balance the effects of TRIPS on developing countries. Specifically we call for the establishment of a multilateral agreement for access to basic science and technology (ABST) to facilitate the transfer of scientific knowledge and technological information to developing countries. Through ABST, developed countries would be committed to support poor countries in enhancing their capacity to assimilate, diffuse and generate knowledge. With the necessary safeguards, ABST would adopt regimes to allow re-searchers from all countries to compete for local research grants and for increasing global access to research outcomes. These regimes should be built on the most-favoured-nation and national treatment principles.  </span></div><div left="57.1" right="277.96" top="115.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="115.8" x1="277.96" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 60.05; y0: 115.8; y1: 125.8; width: 2.95; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Improving the provision of global public goods</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.69" top="87.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="87.65" x1="337.69" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 67.1; y0: 87.65; y1: 97.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">We conclude, as others have before us, that the best hope for generating the kind of catalytic leadership necessary for the provision of global public </span></div><div left="132.79" right="413.37" top="605.65"><span x0="132.79" y0="605.65" x1="413.37" style="x0: 132.79; x1: 136.75; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 3.96; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">accordingly, a Global 25 forum that brings together the heads of state and government from the developed and developing countries that are the most responsible, capable and representative, as well as relevant representa-tives of other groups and regions. With appropriate links to existing formal institutions, such a forum could do much to spur action towards shared goals. And without such a forum&#8212;that marries inclusion and agility&#8212;it will be extremely hard to achieve the reforms to international policies, institutions and financing necessary to achieve common goals. But we cannot stress enough that such a catalytic forum must be matched to&#8212;indeed it must strengthen and make more effective&#8212;formal institutions and the wider process of negotiation and decision-making. This process is necessary to ensure that all states have a chance to ex-press their preferences and participate in the authorization, or rejection, of action, even if the direction is initially set by the Global 25. That the legitimacy of the decision-making mechanisms of the major international institutions is in doubt poses a major obstacle to this process, one requiring structural reform. We thus add our voices to those who have called for re-forming the mechanisms and representation of the UN Security Council and the governing bodies of the IMF and the World Bank, as well as the broader UN system&#8212;reflecting its dual roles in promoting development and managing global issues.The effectiveness of international mechanisms needs also to be enhanced through improved accountability, starting with greater transparency. Such reforms will also aid national mobilization and resource commitments. </span></div><div left="132.79" right="336.0" top="241.65"><span x0="132.79" y0="241.65" x1="336.0" style="x0: 132.79; x1: 139.35; y0: 241.65; y1: 251.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Effective institutions: governance and accountability </span></div><div left="132.79" right="413.32" top="213.65"><span x0="132.79" y0="213.65" x1="413.32" style="x0: 132.79; x1: 136.12; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">In most cases, producing a global public good will require action by international institutions, including building on, reinforcing and often coordinating national action; channelling funds to national programs; monitoring and reporting on progress; and, in a growing number of issue areas, considering and implementing decisions taken at a global level. Thus the quality and the management of international institu-tional capacity are vital for the provision of global public goods. The greater concern is with the question of whether or not, systemically, international institutions have been suitably adapted to play an appro-priate role in the provision of global public goods.

With regard to the IMF, and in line with the IMF Managing Director&#8217;s strategy, more weight should be given to the most underrepresented countries in the governance of the IMF to better reflect the changing struc-ture of the world economy. In the World Bank, developing countries should be more fully represented on its board. The almost identical composition of the IMF and World Bank boards is outdated and should be replaced by boards whose composition better represents the interests of the key stakeholders and the mandates of the respec-tive organizations. The UN Security Council&#8217;s ability to maintain international peace and security would be strengthened by reforms to its membership and abolition of the veto. If this ideal reform cannot be attained, an interim strategy is to add elected, but renewable, seats to the Security Council, open primarily to the states within regional groupings that make the largest financial, military and political commitments to the UN&#8212;the &#8220;Option B&#8221; proposed by the UN High-Level Panel on Threats, Chal-lenges and Change. We also call for three additional reforms to increase the accountabil-ity and effectiveness of international institutions: improved data on the costs and benefits of global public goods, better monitoring of compli-ance with international obligations and independent evaluation of the performance of international institutions. Enhanced support to and use of evidence-based research is an essen-tial step for more effective management of global issues. One important source is the research departments of specialized agencies. The value of their work would be stronger were such agencies to develop a well co-ordinated research programme focused on the costs and benefits&#8212;and distributional impacts&#8212;of global public goods. OECD can play an im-portant role in this regard. Institutional research should be supplemented by independent scholarly research and assessment.Governments and the private sector should sponsor independent research capacity and the de-velopment of research networks on global public goods. More consistent monitoring of state compliance with international obligations is a second necessary reform. In international negotiations gov- ernments should encourage the adoption of formal&#8212;or, if necessary, infor- mal&#8212;monitoring mechanisms to accompany international agreements. Better, more consistent and more independent evaluation of insti- tutional performance would also enhance the accountability of institu-</span></div><div left="132.79" right="413.39" top="605.66"><span x0="132.79" y0="605.66" x1="413.39" style="x0: 132.79; x1: 137.79; y0: 605.66; y1: 615.66; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">part of their reform programmes, international institutions need to set up or upgrade their monitoring and evaluation capacities, including those for independent evaluation of their own performance.

Similarly, national governments bear the primary respon-sibility for ensuring that financing needs for global public goods are met through direct public funding and appropriate incentives and regulatory frameworks that stimulate private funding and the use of market mechanisms. Nations will gain major benefits by increasing their expenditure on global public goods. Initial cost-benefit analyses of various global public goods confirm that money spent on providing them can produce sig-nificant savings compared to the cost of dealing with the ills that arise when such goods are not provided, including financial shocks, spread of new diseases, nuclear proliferation crises and so on. Indeed past experi-ence demonstrates very high benefit-cost ratios for global public goods. This suggests that significant additional expenditures on global public goods are well justified.We are, however, concerned that increased financing for global public goods could crowd out traditional development assistance. Most donor countries have few funding sources to pay for global public goods activities in developing countries, except for those that can be consid-ered to fall within official development assistance (ODA).

Yet, more and more, those lives are shaped by events, decisions and politics beyond national borders. People pay taxes for local and national healthcare, but some of the gravest threats to health arise from infectious diseases that respect no borders. Among other reasons, people vote for governments on the basis of their economic and fiscal policy, but those policies are heavily constrained by international fi-nancial, trade and investment circumstances. And both people and governments recognize that their &#8220;national&#8221; security is determined in large part by the actions and attitudes of groups and governments far afield.Indeed, the world&#8217;s promise can be realized and its perils restrained only through extensive and ambitious cooperation across borders. Ours is a world of shared risks and common opportunities, grounded in the realities of mutual de- pendence and growing interconnection. All peoples&#8217; health, security and prosper-ity depend in part on the quality of their international cooperation, as does the health of the environment. Because this is so, international cooperation has evolved from being a sphere of interstate negotiations on foreign policy matters to a central part of how gov-ernments and people manage their day-to-day lives. And it has been a powerful and tangible force for progress. Past successes provide solid evidence for what can be achieved in the future. With shared vision and collective action, major accom-plishments can be realized. The spread of infectious diseases can be halted, their effects cured. Climate change can be slowed, its effects mitigated. International terrorism can be deterred, and the use of weapons of mass destruction prevented. These goals are difficult, but achievable. So too is the goal of expanding the prosperity that arises from a combination of peace and security, financial stability and international trade. These global issues pose special challenges. In broad terms the goals are widely shared, and all states have national interests in achieving them; but in most instances no state and no private actor, however rich and powerful, can achieve them alone. Only by acting together, by cooperating across borders, can problems like these be effectively and efficiently addressed. International coopera-</span></div><div left="355.27" right="385.29" top="526.16"><span x0="355.27" y0="526.16" x1="385.29" style="x0: 355.27; x1: 385.29; y0: 526.16; y1: 580.16; width: 30.02; font-size: 54.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">1</span></div><div left="147.66" right="410.5" top="605.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="605.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.74; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 7.08; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Yet opportunities to achieve common goals have been missed re-peatedly, and the risks are mounting. New infectious diseases, further changes to the climate, financial instability and a negative spiral of mounting tensions and rising protectionism together threaten to erode international peace and prosperity. Opportunities for collective achievement are lost primarily for two reasons. First, in a world of sovereign, independent states, significant barriers to cooperation remain (from the basic realities of sovereign independence, to the calculations that states make to avoid shouldering their fair share of costs), even when the goals are in the national interests of all. Second, the mechanisms for international cooperation in their current form are weak, or their legitimacy is eroded. The Task Force&#8217;s work was conceived at a time when several initia-tives were under way to bolster international cooperation&#8212;a time of opportunity. It was inspired by the knowledge that past cooperation had achieved impressive results in combating poverty and disease, in promoting security and in protecting the environment. Unfortunately we complete our work at a time when several initia-tives have disappointed&#8212;at a time of rising risk. We conclude our work against the backdrop of growing disquiet among people from all regions about the state of international politics and governance. At a time of concern about the international trading system, occasioned by protec- tionist actions by governments, rising anti-trade sentiment among popu-lations and the failure to complete the Doha trade round. At a time when weekly headlines about avian flu remind us of our vulnerability and sci-entific warnings prompt deep concern about our environment. And at a time of mounting, interlocking crises in the Middle East&#8212;crises that threaten not only that region but also the broader international order.In recent years, successive opportunities to revitalize&#8212;and where necessary, sharply reform&#8212;the structures of international cooperation have been squandered or at best have delivered only partial results. The litany of missed opportunities is impressive only in its length. Since the start of the decade, governments have: failed to bring into force the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty; failed to move forward the Biological Weapons Convention; failed to agree on the necessary actions to give force and meaning to the Kyoto Protocol; failed to avoid war in Iraq; failed to take more than half measures to reform the International Monetary Fund; failed to design a European constitution that could convince voters; failed to break the stalemate in the Doha Round of the </span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.67" top="605.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="605.65" x1="337.67" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 60.02; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 2.92; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">the United Nations (UN) to be shrouded by a squandered opportunity for structural reform and political renewal. The full effect of these missed opportunities may not be felt immedi-ately. Modern history tells us that states allow their systems for cooperation to erode gradually, missing positive opportunities and slowly increasing the odds of a negative spiral of economic reversal and conflict. Nor can we ignore the possibility of worse scenarios. There are alarming warnings about the pace of climate change. The lurch from crisis to crisis in nuclear proliferation brings with it a growing risk of the spread and use of nuclear weapons, especially by terrorist organi-zations. In some regions states appear to be teetering on the edge of internal collapse under the combined weight of poor governance, weak institutions, the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and the regional spillovers from conflict. Health officials warn of the lack of adequate preparation for pandemic disease. And growing imbalances in the international financial system loom over the global economy. The risks of the moment are amplified by the pace of contemporary technological change. Not since the early 1900s has the international system experienced such a rapid rise in the rate of change in commer-cial and communication technology. Then as now, the bedrock system of economic interdependence seems invulnerable. The British thinker Normal Angell observed that &#8220;it is an economic impossibility for one nation to seize or destroy the wealth of another, or for one nation to enrich itself by subjugating another.&#8221;</span><span x0="202.69" y0="287.96" x1="205.55" style="x0: 202.69; x1: 205.55; y0: 287.96; y1: 293.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">2</span><span x0="208.48" y0="283.65" x1="337.73" style="x0: 208.48; x1: 214.83; y0: 283.65; y1: 293.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">But Angell was writing in 1910.

There are unparalleled opportunities to apply modern scientific knowledge and resources to fight disease and protect the environment. Modern technology, much of it developed by the private sector, creates unprecedented access to information by entrepreneurs, civil society and populations as a whole. But the risks are more dire for the sheer de-structive capacity of modern weapons technology, and for the increasing access to that technology. Scientific advance and the ability to rapidly share knowledge have created enormous promise in the ability to solve global problems, but also enormous peril in that these same advances have democratized the power to destroy. </span></div><div left="147.66" right="413.27" top="605.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="605.65" x1="413.27" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.43; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">These developments do not erode the importance of revitalizing the prospects for international cooperation; rather, they make it more urgent. We are convinced that only through the application of effective, ambitious international cooperation is it possible to reduce the risks in the global world and to realize its potential. Such solutions must also create the right incentives for private sector engagement. Civil society can sometimes lead the way, through innovation and through advo-cacy. But the primary responsibility remains with governments, both to take the necessary steps to ensure effective international coopera-tion, and to recognize the national interest&#8212;indeed, the vital national interest&#8212;to do so. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="327.07" top="423.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="423.8" x1="327.07" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 138.77; y0: 423.8; y1: 433.8; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">The benefits of international cooperation</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.23" top="395.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="395.65" x1="413.23" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.43; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">All is not unmitigated gloom&#8212;far from it.

While that same period was far from free of war and conflict, the vi-olence could have been far worse in the absence of multilateral security institutions. The non-proliferation regime did much to slow the spread of nuclear weapons in that dangerous age and to deter their use.

Several of these initiatives have been led, encour-aged or financed by the private sector, recognizing their own interest in effective cooperation. These impressive accomplishments, past and present, inspire our confidence in the future of cooperation. But the current crisis of mul-tilateralism exists not just because of the missed opportunities. Rather there are two sources of the current malaise. First, the institutions set up in 1945 to manage interstate affairs are straining to adapt to the evolu-tion of a global market, to the demands posed by technological change, to the substantial interconnections between their separate spheres of responsibility or to public and political skepticism about their ability to perform. Second, efforts to adapt those institutions have been stymied because governments have failed to address the underlying issue&#8212;the changing distribution of power and the widening sphere of responsi-bility at the international level&#8212;and because the major powers have at </span></div><div left="57.1" right="171.29" top="605.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="605.8" x1="171.29" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.21; y0: 605.8; y1: 615.8; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">The limits of institutions</span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="577.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="577.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.04; y0: 577.65; y1: 587.65; width: 5.94; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Examples of institutional strain abound. In the area of financial stabil-ity, for example, the consequences of the globalizing market are seen in strains at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF&#8217;s manage-ment of the financial crisis in East Asia in 1997&#8211;98 is illustrative. It has been recognized by many, including the Fund&#8217;s Independent Evalua-tion Office, that the Fund did not adequately recognize or analyse the risks associated with its own policies of capital account liberalization. The financial crisis that erupted at the end of the 1990s eroded the fi-nancial health of the rising East Asian economies, and in some instances challenged internal political stability. Similar problems were apparent in Argentina&#8217;s financial crisis. The postwar institutions are also struggling to adapt to technologi-cal change. Perhaps the most acute example is the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose mechanisms are too weak to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons. As access to nuclear technology ad-vances, countries&#8217; ability to move from civilian nuclear energy to a nuclear weapons programme becomes far easier. The result is that it is more difficult for the IAEA to gather reliable information about the nuclear capacities and intentions of its member countries.Nor are strains limited to security. Similar stresses confront responses to the growing threat of infectious diseases. Infectious disease control is an area that has attracted investment and leadership, sometimes by private actors, sometimes by governments. And the WHO is perhaps the one international institution whose reputation has improved in the post 9/11 era. Yet senior WHO officials have warned that their ability to cope with large-scale outbreaks of new infectious diseases may be severely limited. Moreover, growing awareness of the interconnections between these issue areas has not been met by adequate cooperation among respon-sible institutions. Although it is more widely understood that there are important security dimensions to international health, and vice versa, security and health matters are treated as separate and distinct institu-tional spheres. International terrorism has caused new concerns about the security of trade and transport systems, but no international body has the breadth of mandate to ensure that new security approaches do not interfere with international trade rules and commitments.

Similarly, appar-ent links between environmental degradation and conflict are not met with joined responses.Confidence in international cooperation has also been shaken by research that suggests that aid sometimes has been ineffective in com- bating poverty and by revelations of isolated cases of financial impropri-ety by international officials. More generally, insufficient accountability for money and activities within international mechanisms is eroding both public and political support for international aid and international institutions, precisely when they are needed most. And overlaying all of this, the international arena is still struggling to overcome the loss of trust that arose from radically different interpretations of the course of events that led to the war in Iraq. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="260.96" top="367.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="367.8" x1="260.96" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 138.77; y0: 367.8; y1: 377.8; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">The responsibility of states</span></div><div left="132.66" right="410.5" top="339.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="339.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 135.99; y0: 339.65; y1: 349.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">In assessing the prospects for international cooperation, it is indispens-able to be aware of three phenomena that have occurred since the end of the cold war. First, there has been a change in the nature and distribu- tion of economic power and influence at the international level. Mili-tary and political power have become more heavily concentrated. At the same time, more than a dozen developing countries, with combined populations of half of humanity, have gained considerable influence in the global market. Second, the spread of democracy and information technology have brought hundreds of millions of voices into debates about international policy, many of them the voices of people who do not profit from the global economy, residing in countries that do not participate meaningfully in international decision-making. And third, a growing portion of economic activity is being conducted by companies with global reach and massive resources creating circumstances that can limit states&#8217; abilities to shape action beyond their borders.Yet the governance mechanisms of international institutions have not been adapted to these developments. Instead some developed and developing powers have neglected and at times abused international institutions as a vehicle for cooperation, failing to lead efforts at reform, and choosing to work through ad hoc, bilateral and regional mecha-</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.71" top="605.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="605.65" x1="337.71" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 62.31; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 5.21; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">nisms even when those were at odds with the principles of a multilateral order they professed to support.</span><span x0="182.69" y0="595.96" x1="188.4" style="x0: 182.69; x1: 185.55; y0: 595.96; y1: 601.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">11</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.67" top="577.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="577.65" x1="337.67" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 77.73; y0: 577.65; y1: 587.65; width: 5.63; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Power and capacity in global affairs have thus been transformed but not consolidated. The basic result is a negative cycle of underinvest-ment in, and underperformance by, international mechanisms.

However no one can afford to sit idly by and wait for change. Fail-ure to revitalize international cooperation, particularly during troubled periods, will at the very least cause the loss of important opportuni-ties to galvanize efforts towards tackling climate change, to deepen the battle against disease, to advance knowledge in ways that can reap as yet unforeseen benefits and to prevent old and new manifestations of vio-lent conflict. Every year that passes with reforms unattained increases their difficulty and their cost. Left unattended, the current erosion in support for international cooperation risks generating a negative spiral of protectionism, iso-lationism and deepening international divisions, eroding both global prosperity and stability. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.19" top="423.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="423.65" x1="413.19" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 137.87; y0: 423.65; y1: 433.65; width: 5.21; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">of human and animal diseases.

The features that characterize global public goods make them valu-able, but&#8212;as further discussed below&#8212;they are difficult to provide. Precisely because they are available to all once produced, states rou-tinely avoid their own responsibilities, believing others will act and they will benefit (the &#8220;free rider&#8221; problem); but the result is often that too few states act for the good to be produced. And states also resist accepting the restraints on their sovereignty that are often necessary to produce these goods. Indeed much of the difficulty in ensuring the provision of global public goods comes from the international level. It is at this level that our Task Force has chosen to focus its analysis. This does not negate a recognition that the national level is critical for the provision of global public goods.

In fact three dimensions of that relationship can be characterized. First, whereas cooperation for development relies on the traditional divisions between donor states with advanced financial capacities and recipient states with limited resources, the provision of global public goods transcends such divisions; global public goods affect almost all states, and many or all states must be involved in their provision. Second, global public goods can propel development (see box 2.2). For example, financial stability (which results in part from the global public good of the international financial regulation system) is critical to achieving broader economic development. There is also evidence that development assistance is more effective in countries where gov-ernments have sound fiscal and economic policy. A country&#8217;s policy environment, however, depends on more than the policies it adopts unilaterally. It depends also on the international policy environment, including such areas as international trade. Improve these systems, and the returns on development should increase. Third, because limited state capacity serves as a barrier to the provision of many important global public goods, development is fundamental to their supply, including goods for health, security and the environment.</span><span x0="327.04" y0="203.96" x1="332.69" style="x0: 327.04; x1: 329.9; y0: 203.96; y1: 209.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">17</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.7" top="185.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="185.65" x1="337.7" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 82.1; y0: 185.65; y1: 195.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">With good reason, some are concerned that financing for global public goods may crowd out traditional development assistance.

Just as in the national sphere each citizen must make sacrifices&#8212;in the form of taxes, regulations and some restrictions on individual lib- erty&#8212;to realize the benefits of security and freedom, so at the inter-national level all states have national interests in making the necessary short-term sacrifices, and exercising the necessary restraint, to enable the long-term rewards and benefits that only international cooperation can provide. The concept helps us recognize that, with a long-term view and with concerted action, the global interest and the national interest can not only be reconciled but are mutually reinforcing. This provides a compelling framework to use in national settings to persuade domestic audiences and authorities of the value of commit- ting national resources, and restraining national autonomy, in the pur-suit of common international goals.

But the opposite is true. In fact the very nature of global public goods means that demand will tend to outweigh supply.

Moreover even the long-term goals themselves may resonate differently for different governments. Climate change impacts differently on different countries, and in the short term some may even profit from changes to local climate.

The major barriers to solving global problems, then, do not lie with institutional strain&#8212;a symptom of a problem, not its cause. Instead, the major obstacles emerge from the fact that the international sphere is characterized principally by voluntary interaction between sovereign states&#8212;all with ideas and values and interests of their own. While social, political and economic interactions draw peoples together, as does an increasingly globalized private sector, separate na-tional governments remain responsible for balancing and legitimizing the policies to structure their interactions. While organizations such as the European Union are altering our conceptions of sovereignty, democratically elected governments remain the most consistently  legitimate form of authority yet devised, and electorates are often less keen than politicians to accept multilateral restrictions on domestic sovereignty. Sovereignty, often declared to be in rapid retreat, perse- veres nonetheless.Thus voluntary cooperation between independent, sovereign states remains the hallmark of the international system and its essen-</span></div><div left="147.66" right="410.5" top="605.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="605.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.56; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Some global public goods can be supplied without widespread co-operation in their supply, even though there would by definition be global access to them once supplied. Historically the easiest global pub-lic goods to produce are &#8220;best-shot&#8221; public goods&#8212;goods that simply have to be supplied once for them to be available to all. The discovery of a vaccine is such a good; once discovered it potentially can be avail-able to all in perpetuity. Similarly, it has been argued that the United States, acting in its own right and in its own interest, created important best-shot global public goods by securing international air and sea lanes, maintaining a strong currency used widely as a standard, acting as the basic financial regulator and serving as the lender of last resort.</span><span x0="323.46" y0="455.96" x1="329.18" style="x0: 323.46; x1: 326.32; y0: 455.96; y1: 461.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">20</span><span x0="332.16" y0="451.65" x1="413.26" style="x0: 332.16; x1: 335.49; y0: 451.65; y1: 461.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">It is worth stressing, however, that the United States played this role in the context of a broad international consensus that it helped to forge, a consensus embedded in the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank&#8212;institutions within which the United States also agreed to constrain its own power. Consensus and constraint were important conditions for leadership. In most cases action by a single government will not suffice for the provision of global public goods, and broad regional or international cooperation is the only recourse. In these cases overcoming political and value differences forms a second kind of obstacle. Achieving some form of international agreement or consensus is an important part of providing global public goods. Thus we can by and large describe global public goods both in their economic sense and with the understanding that, for the most part, the large majority of states&#8212;as well as national private and civic actors&#8212;will see positive value in their production and consumption. But it is im-portant not to neglect the reality that some of these are contested. The question of how states and populations participate in decision-making or consensus building around the provision of global public goods is critical. The perceived value of a good will depend substantially on the quality and character of states&#8217; participation in the decision to supply it. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="315.23" top="115.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="115.8" x1="315.23" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.44; y0: 115.8; y1: 125.8; width: 7.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Overcoming obstacles to cooperation </span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.25" top="87.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="87.65" x1="413.25" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.43; y0: 87.65; y1: 97.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The difficulties in providing global public goods point to one of the major obstacles to their provision: cooperation at the international level </span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="605.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="605.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 61.37; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 4.27; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">can be overcome when three ingredients are present: catalytic leader- ship and action, effective institutions and adequate and appropriate fi- nancing.

This does not negate recognition that the national level is critical in the provision of global public goods. In-deed we stress the principle of subsidiarity&#8212;solving problems closest to where they occur. But the most enduring difficulties in providing global public goods are found at the international level, and it is at this level that we have been mandated to focus our analysis.That analysis shows there are fundamental differences between leadership at the national level and the kind of leadership required for international cooperation. At the national level governments act with authority or mandate. At the local and national level the provision of public goods is typi-cally organized by the state, with authority to tax, regulate and even coerce to ensure such provision. At the global level there is no institution with equivalent powers. For good reasons, there is no world government with the authority to tax, to conscript, to regulate or to quarantine. Therefore, at the international level, action to initiate the provision of a public good must be voluntary. But, given the natural reluctance of nation states to constrain their sovereignty, as well as the free-rider problem, voluntarism to trigger the provision of a global public good does not occur easily.  Historically it has proven necessary for one or several countries with an enlightened vision and clear sense of responsibility to ignite the processes conducive to the solution of problems that may affect all of humanity.The question is: it is up to whom to play this role in our time? We submit that it is up to the countries that are relatively richer, with larger populations, bigger defence and security capabilities that have been his-torically influential and that, typically, have benefited the most from the rule-based multilateral system.

In addition, as noted above, the United States maintained a stable currency, secured sea and air lanes for trade and transport, acted as a lender of last resort in financial crises and served as the basic regulator of international financial markets, providing the essential underpinnings to the global economy. It was true of the Soviet Union, which in 1959 initiated action at the World Health Organization (WHO) that would lead to the eradication of smallpox&#8212;one of the great achievements of the multilateral system. Other powers, such as France, have acted to create international bodies that regulate critical spheres of international co-operation, including civil aviation. The European Union has become an important source of stability and growth that often lent its support to international cooperative initiatives. It is a role also at times played by smaller states, as it was by Nor-way, which in the 1960s used its political standing to lead the charge towards what would eventually become the Nuclear Non-Prolifera-tion Treaty. Or, when East Timor fell into turmoil and crisis in 1999, and Australia led a multinational force that restored order and cre-ated the necessary space for the eventual establishment of the Timor Leste state, shouldering the military and the financial burden of the peacekeeping operation.</span><span x0="234.21" y0="189.96" x1="240.02" style="x0: 234.21; x1: 237.06; y0: 189.96; y1: 195.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">21</span><span x0="244.24" y0="185.66" x1="410.5" style="x0: 244.24; x1: 252.16; y0: 185.66; y1: 195.66; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Historically, the development of peace-keeping as a tool&#8212;critical to the restoration of collapsed states after war&#8212;owes much to the leadership of Canada, which proposed the tool and for 40 years participated in every UN peacekeeping opera- tion, often in a leading role.</span><span x0="246.37" y0="133.96" x1="252.17" style="x0: 246.37; x1: 249.23; y0: 133.96; y1: 139.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">22</span></div><div left="147.66" right="413.24" top="115.66"><span x0="147.66" y0="115.66" x1="413.24" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.56; y0: 115.66; y1: 125.66; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Such roles can also be played by private actors, as illustrated by the March of Dimes Foundation and Rotary International in devel-oping and supplying polio vaccines and by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in financing efforts to combat malaria, tuberculosis and </span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.66" top="605.66"><span x0="72.1" y0="605.66" x1="337.66" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 75.43; y0: 605.66; y1: 615.66; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">In each case a government or private actor recognized that greater power or financial resources engendered responsibility, provided ad-vance commitments and resources and used the resultant position of leadership to catalyse other states&#8217; action and persuade them to partici-pate in a common solution.

Whereas respon-sible leadership and catalytic action can be critical in overcoming obstacles, it is rarely the case that global public goods can be achieved without sustained and reliable engagement within institutions, often over decades. For example, once the Soviet Union had initiated ac-tion against smallpox in 1959, it took over 20 years of sustained engagement by almost all states, coordinated and supported by the WHO, to eradicate it.</span><span x0="146.39" y0="287.96" x1="152.19" style="x0: 146.39; x1: 149.24; y0: 287.96; y1: 293.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">23</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.73" top="269.66"><span x0="72.1" y0="269.66" x1="337.73" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.87; y0: 269.66; y1: 279.66; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">There are two facets to the role of institutions in providing global public goods: they are the main venue for states to negotiate and agree on preferences and priorities for global issues; and they are tools for implementation. Most important, regional and international institutions are the pri-mary place for states to come together to shape common preferences or agree on priorities. It is here that the &#8220;good&#8221; in global public good is contested and agreed (or not). And it is in the governance mechanisms of regional and international institutions that state preferences are most actively debated and the direction and strategies for supplying global public goods ultimately decided. Some of these mechanisms entail negotiations by all states, such as in the World Health Assembly. And while negotiations of the whole are cumbersome, in the case of infectious disease they are appropriate because all states must implement the solutions. More commonly, how-</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.18" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="413.18" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 137.35; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 4.69; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">good. For example, 90% of the world economy is held by 20 states, whose common action is necessary for financial stability. When the governing mechanisms of institutions engage the states necessary for solutions, institutional decision-making can be efficient, but in the absence of governance reforms to match evolving realities, this is now seldom the case. Moreover, there is a broader issue in that however few states are in-volved in producing a global public good, by definition all will consume it, often in ways that are at odds with national economic and political interests. This creates a need for all (or most) states to have some voice in the articulation and decision-making around global public goods.Most global public goods fall between two extremes: one requiring all states&#8217; involvement, and the other requiring action only by a few. In such circumstances decision-making through the governing mechanisms of international institutions should be an efficient way to reach decisions. However the perceived legitimacy of the governing mechanisms of insti-tutions is crucial. Where legitimacy is present, many states will accept the good; where not, it will generate resistance and non-compliance. Gov-erning mechanisms that engage responsible states and are broadly seen as legitimate are thus crucial in the provision of global public goods.A second feature of institutions is that they can serve as repositories of analytical and operational capacity. This is particularly so for the IMF and the World Bank and the UN specialized agencies, such as the WHO, the IAEA and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organiza-tion (UNESCO), all of which have substantial repositories of specialized  capacity. The quality of that capacity is highly variable, of course, partially because of a lack of clear accountability for many of these institutions. It is important to improve this specialized capacity. Measured against the option of each state involved maintaining its own separate capacity to tackle problems with transnational reach, regional and international institutions can have significant efficiencies. Imagine the inefficiencies if every state sought to maintain a global natural disaster response capacity or a global infectious disease surveillance system. Moreover, interna-tional institutions, because of their global reach, end up engaged in far more cases than their national counterparts, enabling deeper learning and the development of core skills.But there are significant weaknesses to these institutions as well. Centralization of activity among international organizations will work well only if they are made more accountable to their members and for </span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.67" top="605.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="605.65" x1="337.67" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.04; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 5.94; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Even this is not enough; institutions must also be properly designed in relation to the capacity and interests of states and the obstacles out-lined above. The most effective institutions create incentives for states to participate and sanctions for non-participation. For example, when states negotiated the Montreal Protocol governing the reduction of substances that deplete the ozone layer, its framers were aware that they would face tough challenges in generating state compliance with vol-untary controls. Recognizing the likelihood of significant free-rider problems down the road, the group of states that led negotiations agreed a package of incentives for compliance and disincentives against free riding (trade sanctions). This was accompanied by monitoring compli-ance, essential for supplying incentives and for applying sanctions. Similarly the binding dispute resolution system of the World Trade Organization is critical to the effectiveness of the international trade regime. One can only imagine the chaos in international trade if states could cheat on the rules without consequence. As a general rule, the harder a global public good is to produce, the more contested are the preferences that surround it and the stronger will need to be the international mechanisms involved in its production. In a world of 200 states with sharply divergent preferences, global problems will likely be solved only by effective international mechanisms&#8212;ones with teeth, the legitimacy to act and the necessary governance and ac-countability reforms to make their action credible. International mechanisms currently operate under a growing cloud of public and political skepticism based on a combination of uncertainty about effectiveness and results and concerns about corruption. This is eroding the willingness of national constituencies to free up the resources to pay for international activities or goods. Even the most prosperous and traditionally most generous countries face strains on their finances and important domestic constraints in devoting adequate resources to in-ternational programmes and institutions widely seen as unreliable and unaccountable. The demand for accountability is further fuelled by the growing engagement of private sector actors, including civil society. In most instances global public goods will not be agreed and will not be provided in the absence of decision-making within and imple-mentation by international institutions. And in most instances, currently, the decision-making mechanisms of those institutions are widely per-ceived as illegitimate. There is thus an acute need for reform to the governing mechanisms of the major international institutions, as well as </span></div><div left="132.66" right="273.95" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="273.95" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.85; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 7.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Adequate and appropriate financing </span></div><div left="132.66" right="410.5" top="577.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="577.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.06; y0: 577.65; y1: 587.65; width: 7.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Global public goods must also be financed&#8212;an additional challenge. Fi-nancing of global public goods has two main dimensions. First, the good has to be paid for. Whether in the form of reserves for financial crises, the costs of nuclear inspections or the recurrent costs of the institutions that maintain standards and rules for communications and trade, global public goods have costs. Second, it is sometimes necessary to create fi-nancial incentives to persuade a broad band of states and private actors to participate in the necessary action or to take the necessary steps to supply a global public good. Financing solutions were critical in overcoming obstacles to the eradication of smallpox which, accomplished in 1980, serves as one of the great achievements of international cooperation (see figure 2.1). It was crucial that every country be involved in the effort; however, once the WHO action was under way, weakest link problems began to emerge, as countries with limited resources did not always allocate them to smallpox eradication programmes. Despite the good economic return on the investment in eradication, the international response was scant. This challenge was overcome first through mandatory financial contributions at the WHO and then by extensive voluntary contribu-tions, which created incentives for states with the most limited capacity to participate in the eradication effort.</span></div><div left="76.47" right="288.73" top="270.21"><span x0="76.47" y0="270.21" x1="288.73" style="x0: 76.47; x1: 82.4; y0: 270.21; y1: 278.21; width: 5.93; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Number of countries with endemic smallpox, 1967&#8211;1977</span><span style="x0: 39.51; x1: 43.06; y0: 270.24; y1: 278.24; width: 3.55; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: BTYHGU+HelveticaNeue-Condensed;" x0="39.51" y0="270.24" x1="69.4">Figure 2.1</span></div><div left="379.37" right="386.57" top="64.58"><span x0="379.37" y0="64.58" x1="386.57" style="x0: 379.37; x1: 386.57; y0: 64.58; y1: 76.58; width: 7.2; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ZDEVEY+Courier;">(cid:0)</span></div><div left="64.73" right="69.01" top="95.47"><span x0="64.73" y0="95.47" x1="69.01" style="x0: 64.73; x1: 69.01; y0: 95.47; y1: 103.16; width: 4.28; font-size: 7.69; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BTYHGU+HelveticaNeue-Light;">(cid:228)</span></div><div left="64.73" right="69.01" top="116.59"><span x0="64.73" y0="116.59" x1="69.01" style="x0: 64.73; x1: 69.01; y0: 116.59; y1: 124.28; width: 4.28; font-size: 7.69; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BTYHGU+HelveticaNeue-Light;">(cid:120)</span></div><div left="60.17" right="68.74" top="137.47"><span x0="60.17" y0="137.47" x1="68.74" style="x0: 60.17; x1: 64.45; y0: 137.47; y1: 145.16; width: 4.28; font-size: 7.69; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BTYHGU+HelveticaNeue-Light;">(cid:163)(cid:228)</span></div><div left="60.17" right="68.74" top="158.35"><span x0="60.17" y0="158.35" x1="68.74" style="x0: 60.17; x1: 64.45; y0: 158.35; y1: 166.04; width: 4.28; font-size: 7.69; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BTYHGU+HelveticaNeue-Light;">(cid:163)(cid:120)</span></div><div left="60.17" right="68.74" top="179.23"><span x0="60.17" y0="179.23" x1="68.74" style="x0: 60.17; x1: 64.45; y0: 179.23; y1: 186.92; width: 4.28; font-size: 7.69; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BTYHGU+HelveticaNeue-Light;">(cid:211)(cid:228)</span></div><div left="60.17" right="68.74" top="200.11"><span x0="60.17" y0="200.11" x1="68.74" style="x0: 60.17; x1: 64.45; y0: 200.11; y1: 207.8; width: 4.28; font-size: 7.69; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BTYHGU+HelveticaNeue-Light;">(cid:211)(cid:120)</span></div><div left="60.17" right="68.74" top="221.22"><span x0="60.17" y0="221.22" x1="68.74" style="x0: 60.17; x1: 64.45; y0: 221.22; y1: 228.91; width: 4.28; font-size: 7.69; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BTYHGU+HelveticaNeue-Light;">(cid:206)(cid:228)</span></div><div left="60.17" right="68.74" top="242.11"><span x0="60.17" y0="242.11" x1="68.74" style="x0: 60.17; x1: 64.45; y0: 242.11; y1: 249.8; width: 4.28; font-size: 7.69; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BTYHGU+HelveticaNeue-Light;">(cid:206)(cid:120)</span></div><div left="78.89" right="345.86" top="83.71"><span x0="78.89" y0="83.71" x1="345.86" style="x0: 78.89; x1: 83.18; y0: 83.71; y1: 91.4; width: 4.28; font-size: 7.69; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BTYHGU+HelveticaNeue-Light;">(cid:163)(cid:153)(cid:200)(cid:199)(cid:163)(cid:153)(cid:200)(cid:110)(cid:163)(cid:153)(cid:200)(cid:153)(cid:163)(cid:153)(cid:199)(cid:228)(cid:163)(cid:153)(cid:199)(cid:163)(cid:163)(cid:153)(cid:199)(cid:211)(cid:163)(cid:153)(cid:199)(cid:206)(cid:163)(cid:153)(cid:199)(cid:123)(cid:163)(cid:153)(cid:199)(cid:120)(cid:163)(cid:153)(cid:199)(cid:200)(cid:163)(cid:153)(cid:199)(cid:199)</span></div><div left="72.89" right="224.5" top="250.28"><span x0="72.89" y0="250.28" x1="224.5" style="x0: 72.89; x1: 78.45; y0: 250.28; y1: 257.97; width: 5.56; font-size: 7.69; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ZDEVEY+HelveticaNeue-Roman;">(cid:32)(cid:213)(cid:147)(cid:76)(cid:105)(cid:192)(cid:202)(cid:156)(cid:118)(cid:202)(cid:86)(cid:156)(cid:213)(cid:152)(cid:204)(cid:192)(cid:136)(cid:105)(cid:195)(cid:202)(cid:220)(cid:136)(cid:204)(cid:133)(cid:202)(cid:105)(cid:152)(cid:96)(cid:105)(cid:147)(cid:136)(cid:86)(cid:202)(cid:195)(cid:147)(cid:62)(cid:143)(cid:143)(cid:171)(cid:156)(cid:221)</span></div><div left="39.45" right="57.1" top="65.33"><span x0="39.45" y0="65.33" x1="57.1" style="x0: 39.45; x1: 42.33; y0: 65.33; y1: 71.33; width: 2.88; font-size: 6.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ALOBSW+HelveticaNeue-LightCondObl;">Source: </span><span x0="57.1" y0="65.33" x1="199.04" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 59.66; y0: 65.33; y1: 71.33; width: 2.56; font-size: 6.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ALOBSW+HelveticaNeue-LightCond;">Fenner, F., D.A.

Similarly, in UN peacekeeping, states that contribute troops are provided with a financial incentive tied to the scale of participation. This is inadequate to fully compensate for the costs of troops from the wealthiest states, but adequate to compensate and create incentives for less developed countries. Without such incentives, successes in combat-ing erosion of the ozone layer or in reducing the level of civil war could not have been accomplished. But just as international institutions currently operate under a shroud of scepticism, so national governments increasingly have dif- ficulty in persuading domestic constituencies of the value of spend-ing national resources on international action. If adequate financing for global public goods is to be realized, governments will have to convince sceptical publics that they have made reforms to ensure bet-ter use of existing resources; will have to innovate; and will have to create the right set of incentives to mobilize and harness the private sector, which has much to gain from and much to contribute to well-organized international cooperation. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="110.79" top="311.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="311.8" x1="110.79" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.51; y0: 311.8; y1: 321.8; width: 7.41; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Conclusion</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.65" top="283.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="283.65" x1="337.65" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 67.1; y0: 283.65; y1: 293.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">We define global public goods as ones available for all to consume and ones whose benefits in principle can be enjoyed by the governments and people of each state without impinging on the enjoyment of oth-ers. The sphere of global public goods with which we are concerned is delineated by issues that are broadly conceived as important to the international community; that, for the most part, cannot or will not be adequately addressed by individual countries acting alone; and that are defined through a broad international consensus or a legitimate process of decision-making. We recognize that much of the action required to provide global public goods takes place at the national level. But the most intransigent obstacles arise at the international level, in the very structure of inter-national cooperation between independent, sovereign states. Historically the supply of global public goods has required three critical factors.

Effective vaccines against and treatments for diseases affecting people living in developing countries are chronically stalled because pharmaceutical companies lack incentives. Ideally the international community should have a fully function- ing surveillance system, effective treatment and a fluid supply of vac-cines (including development, production and distribution) to prevent the emergence and spread of the most deadly diseases. This would require sharply improved surveillance, prevention and treatment in all countries. Such efforts should also address the conditions that give rise to new diseases, including poor sanitation, hygiene, public health sys-tems, farming practices and communication networks. International standards would be introduced to facilitate coordination and establish benchmarks for investment. Research and development for vaccines would have to be ramped up, both regionally and globally, and then complemented by greater ca- pacity to develop, manufacture and distribute new treatments and vac-cines for emerging diseases. For this purpose, there would be a global preparedness plan that establishes rules for preparedness and provides incentives for distribution of treatment and vaccines to the places where they are needed the most.</span></div><div left="132.66" right="352.03" top="227.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="227.65" x1="352.03" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.85; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 7.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">An immediate strategy for controlling infectious diseases </span></div><div left="132.66" right="410.5" top="199.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="199.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.43; y0: 199.65; y1: 209.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The current situation is far from optimal, but we can begin to move to-ward this goal.

All states and populations would benefit. Indeed, given the additional benefits from investing in national and global health systems&#8212;direct health benefits and significant de-velopmental benefits&#8212;battling infectious disease perfectly highlights both the necessity of global action to combat common ills and the common global benefit from cooperation to do so. Cooperation to build public health capacity in the developing world is a clear win-win strategy, while failing to cooperate exposes both rich and poor to a growing threat of pandemic disease.Governments, the private sector and civic actors will all have to contribute to expanding the financing available for action in this realm. In the private/civic sector the compelling example provided by Bill &amp; Melinda Gates and Warren Buffet warrants emulation. Gov-ernments, too, will have to address the long-term financial challenges here (issues we address in more depth in chapter 10), highlighting both the achievability and the benefits to be realized from spending the necessary resources.</span></div><div left="132.79" right="413.38" top="353.65"><span x0="132.79" y0="353.65" x1="413.38" style="x0: 132.79; x1: 139.77; y0: 353.65; y1: 363.65; width: 6.98; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Kyoto Protocol established an initial target and timetable for reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the UNFCCC: roughly a 5% reduction in the emissions of the industrial countries during the period 2008&#8211;12 (working from a 1990 baseline). In the most recent meeting of Minis-ters on Climate Action (June 2006, South Africa), consensus on how to build a post-2012 climate regime included merging existing strategies, such as packages for national sustainable development, implementation of the Convention and mechanisms for burden-sharing. Kyoto only limits the emissions of certain countries for a short pe-riod of time. It was intended to be a first step of a long process. Kyoto entered into force in February 2005. The United States and Austra-lia have declined to participate in the Protocol, lessening its potential impact on the reduction of emissions. The latest climate change ne- gotiations in Montreal in November 2005 failed to make major break-throughs. There was one positive development, however: the United States and China agreed to be part of informal discussions on a post-2012 regime. This development creates an opening for addressing one of three crucial aspects of global climate change, which have thus far been in-adequately addressed. No effective action on climate change can be achieved without the engagement in a serious catalytic role by the </span></div><div left="76.47" right="202.24" top="612.25"><span x0="76.47" y0="612.25" x1="202.24" style="x0: 76.47;

It is not known whether climate change will be abrupt, or how abrupt climate change, should it occur, would materialize (weak-ening in the thermohaline circulation and disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are two possibilities). The second is that current strategies do too little to respond to the needs of communities most vulnerable to climate change&#8212;most of them in developing countries. Evidence suggests that agriculture in the tropical zones of Africa will be particularly hard hit. Countries there are already among the poorest in the world, and small changes in climate could impose substantial changes in human well-being, undermining efforts to promote development. The most efficient way to address climate change would be to broaden the use of carbon taxes. Effective use of such a tax would generate a double dividend.</span><span x0="170.32" y0="357.96" x1="176.09" style="x0: 170.32; x1: 173.17; y0: 357.96; y1: 363.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">52</span><span x0="179.34" y0="353.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 179.34; x1: 184.65; y0: 353.65; y1: 363.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">First, the tax would help reduce emis-sions of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas.

Developed countries would commit to reducing their emissions by adopting a specific target. Developing countries would adopt differentiated targets; they can first increase emissions to meet their immediate economic development needs, but then agree to sta-bilize emissions and eventually begin to reduce emissions by a set date. They would also commit to increase their energy efficiency as they pursue economic development.This scheme would build on the mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, such as allowing countries to trade their obligations to limit emissions. Carbon trading mobilizes financial resources, contributes to systematic emissions reduction and provides a long-term incentive to invest in climate friendly technologies.

For emerging-market economies the priorities are to adhere to sustainable debt and fiscal management and exchange rate policies to reduce the risk of crisis, avoid the buildup of excessive net foreign liabilities (especially short term, whether in official or private accounts), ensure transparency and adhere to agreed standards and codes. These economies must also pursue adequate social policies to make growth more inclusive. Long-run stability requires so-cial and political sustainability.

These principles could facilitate dia-logue between creditors and debtors (critical to the debt restructuring process), promote corrective policy action to reduce the frequency and severity of crises and improve the prospects for an orderly and expedi-tious resolution of crises. A third mechanism is some insurance-type instrument that would allow countries with strong policies beset by a financial crisis to draw from the IMF and line up significant international financial support very quickly, along the lines of the IMF&#8217;s Contingent Credit Line, which expired in 2004. It has been proposed that the Fund or the World Bank establish a new medium-term stability and growth facility for supporting emerging-market economies that would be sufficiently large, front-loaded and long-lived to facilitate the reduction of large debt burdens while encouraging social policies designed to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</span><span x0="297.72" y0="329.96" x1="303.43" style="x0: 297.72; x1: 300.57; y0: 329.96; y1: 335.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">74</span><span x0="304.4" y0="325.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 304.4; x1: 311.17; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The Fund is currently con-sidering a new instrument that provides a high-access line of credit to emerging markets that have strong macroeconomic policies but which remain vulnerable to shocks.The IMF should consider to a greater extent the impacts of policy options on the most vulnerable sections of society, both in its surveil- lance work (as suggested by the IMF Independent Evaluation Office)</span><span x0="404.78" y0="245.96" x1="410.5" style="x0: 404.78; x1: 407.64; y0: 245.96; y1: 251.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">75</span></div><div left="132.66" right="335.33" top="227.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="227.65" x1="335.33" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 136.62; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 3.96; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">and in designing capital account crisis programmes.</span><span x0="147.66" y0="213.65" x1="255.68" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.95; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 7.29; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Combating money laundering. </span><span x0="255.07" y0="213.65" x1="413.15" style="x0: 255.07; x1: 264.24; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 9.17; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Markedly less visible than financial crises is the often inadvertent assistance provided to criminal elements for the cross-border financing of illegal and terrorist activities.

For one thing, the GATT itself (Article XXIV) allows for preferen-tial trade agreements, which in recent years have mushroomed to almost 200, and in many instances can impede global trade rather than promote it. The system also lacks the proper means to discipline instruments such as standards, anti-dumping and safeguards that are frequently used for outright, arbitrary and discriminatory protectionism.</span><span x0="275.88" y0="511.96" x1="281.6" style="x0: 275.88; x1: 278.74; y0: 511.96; y1: 517.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">79</span><span x0="283.9" y0="507.65" x1="337.71" style="x0: 283.9; x1: 289.21; y0: 507.65; y1: 517.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Furthermore important sectors remain outside the general principles and disciplines of the system. For more than 50 years under various derogations from GATT rules&#8212;most recently under the Multifibre Agreement (MFA) phased out only on 1 January 2005&#8212;trade in textiles and clothing was subject to quotas. To this day in many countries, trade in these products continues to be restricted by high tariffs and even quantitative restric-tions allowed by some transitory WTO provisions. Even more anomalous than the textiles and clothing case has been the treatment of agriculture. This sector was brought into the legal framework of the multilateral trading system only in 1994 as a result of the Uruguay Round. This long-overdue step happened, however, with-out any meaningful liberalization of farm trade, which has continued to be affected by massive subsidies for farm production in rich countries and enormous market access barriers (tariffs and others) applied by both developed and developing countries.Interestingly in the Uruguay Round, in order to get the agreement to phase out the MFA and to bring agriculture into the WTO system, developing countries had to accept bringing intellectual property pro- tection&#8212;clearly a non-trade issue&#8212;into the WTO&#8217;s jurisdiction.The system has thus permitted greater protectionism in products of significant export interest for developing countries. The provisions allowing for special and differential treatment for these countries, and the trade preferences granted by developed countries, do not compen-sate in any meaningful way for the trading opportunities missed as a consequence of the remaining protectionism. Objectively, the system is unbalanced against the interests of developing countries.</span></div><div left="57.1" right="195.28" top="115.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="115.65" x1="195.28" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.08; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 6.98; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">The breakdown of the Doha Round</span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="87.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="87.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.45; y0: 87.65; y1: 97.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Balancing the system to make it more supportive of developing coun-tries&#8217; development was a core objective of the Doha Round&#8212;dubbed </span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.25" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="413.25" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 137.56; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">2001. But this sense of purpose was short-lived. Since its launch, the round&#8217;s story has been one of key deadlines missed, one WTO Min-isterial Conference (Canc&#250;n, September 2003) collapsed, another one (Hong Kong, December 2005) with meaningless results and, finally, a total suspension of the negotiations for lack of agreement on any of the important issues (July 2006). It is unlikely that the talks can be restored with any chance of success in the near future. The main reason for the Doha breakdown is to be found in the agriculture negotiations. The majority of developed countries has re- sisted effective liberalization in farm trade all along. Years of negotia-tions could not make these countries agree on formulas that would effectively open their farm markets to imports and significantly reduce their most distorting farm subsidies. In fact what was brought to the table even up to the very collapse of the talks would have accomplished little to open up agricultural markets and to temper the huge distortions caused in those markets by the high subsidies granted by OECD coun- tries to their farmers.</span><span x0="218.16" y0="385.96" x1="225.49" style="x0: 218.16; x1: 221.01; y0: 385.96; y1: 391.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">80 </span><span x0="225.83" y0="381.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 225.83; x1: 234.06; y0: 381.65; y1: 391.65; width: 8.23; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Of course more than real farm reform in rich countries was needed to have concluded the Doha Round successfully. Developing countries would have had to undertake at least a modi-cum of agricultural liberalization as well as be more forthcoming about dismantling remaining barriers in industrial goods. More ambition to open up trade in services, including some modest steps in the temporary movement of workers, was also indispensable. The question of how to compensate the poorest countries for their loss of preferences, which a good agreement would have brought about, also needed to be seriously considered along with the issue of how to support the same group of countries to improve their infrastructure and develop their export ca-pacity. An &#8220;aid for trade fund&#8221; commensurate with these endeavours is indispensable for making a large number of developing countries equal members of the multilateral trading system. As argued above, the system is also in great need of stronger provisions to prevent backdoor protec-tionism through regional trade agreements and through the artifices of standards, anti-dumping and safeguards. All parties have contributed to the disappointment produced by the Doha Round. There has been a lack of ambitious trade reformers, among both the developed and the developing countries, capable of producing liberalizing initiatives to break the numerous impasses en-dured throughout the negotiations. Considering their relative wealth and the benefits that they have already received from the multilateral </span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="605.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="605.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 62.1; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">pean Union, Japan and the United States) should have a special respon-sibility towards enhancing and strengthening the system, a responsibility which they have not fulfilled during the present round. Needless to say, the Doha Round fiasco does not stem from a fail- ure of the trade negotiators to do their job. These negotiators&#8217; capaci-ties can never exceed the mandate received from the governments they represent. It will be up to the highest levels of political leadership in those governments to do what it takes to complete adequately the Doha agenda. It makes little sense to go back to the negotiating table if the ac- tors with the biggest responsibility do not first address seriously their re-spective domestic political economy issues which have precluded them from playing coherently their role at the multilateral talks.    The cost of failure in the Doha Round is not only the income op-portunities forgone for both developed and developing countries that its successful conclusion would provide, but more importantly the losses that all will incur if the system is allowed to deteriorate and eventually proves incapable of preventing countries from back-pedaling into pro-tectionism&#8212;as has happened before in history. Despite its achievements, the multilateral trading system is not yet a consolidated global public good. It remains vulnerable to serious erosion by episodes of protec-tionism.

The Panel&#8217;s call for a new security consensus was widely embraced by governments and civil society organizations, but unfortunately only minimally adopted by the UN World Summit in 2005. In acting on the Panel&#8217;s recommendations, governments made some progress on some clusters of threats, but failed altogether on other issues. Most progress was made on strengthening the UN&#8217;s role for pre-venting and responding to internal conflict, genocide and large-scale human rights abuses. Against many expectations, the Summit strongly endorsed the concept of the responsibility to protect, recognizing that the international community has the responsibility to take col- lective action where national authorities are manifestly failing to pro-tect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. It also created a new Peacebuilding Commission to coordinate and sustain post-conflict reconstruction and endorsed the concept of a new Human Rights Council, which was brought into being by the General Assembly in April 2006. Less noticed but still significant were agreements at the Summit to strengthen the UN&#8217;s approach to tackling organized crime and re- lated transnational threats.But there were three areas of major disappointment in the World Summit outcomes on peace and security (quite apart from failing to even agree to a starting point for action on reform of the UN Security Council, an issue we address in Part III). First, the Summit failed to offer even a single sentence on the critical issues of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Second, although the Summit did unequivo-cally condemn terrorism&#8212;without any reservations, for the first time in the UN&#8217;s history&#8212;it neither endorsed a widely acclaimed coun-ter-terrorism strategy proposed by the Secretary-General, nor agreed to a definition of terrorism. Third, while the Summit reaffirmed the centrality of the UN Charter on issues relating to the use of force in the international community, it did not accept the Panel&#8217;s recommen-dations for more detailed criteria for the use of force, which had been designed to maximize the chances of reaching consensus when po-tentially highly divisive cases arose in the future as they have in recent years, nowhere more than in the case of Iraq.

And were a terrorist organization to detonate such a device in a major city, the direct and indirect economic, social and political costs would be both enormous and global.

Continued debates about the causes of terrorism, particularly in terms of its relationship to poverty and occupation, impede interna- tional agreement on how to tackle the phenomenon.</span></div><div left="57.1" right="248.49" top="297.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="297.65" x1="248.49" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.45; y0: 297.65; y1: 307.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Preventing the spread and use of nuclear weapons</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.8" top="269.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="269.65" x1="337.8" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 60.43; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">If the international regime for disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons stands as one of the most important accomplish-ments of the multilateral system in the post-Second World War era, its ongoing erosion is the most worrying and most dangerous of contemporary developments (see figure 6.1). The establishment of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its related agen-cies, protocols and control mechanisms helped to deter the spread and thus the risk of use of nuclear weapons for more than 40 years. Alone among weapons, they have the potential to destroy humanity in its entirety. While some of the nuclear weapons states have reduced their stockpiles, others are building them, and remaining stockpiles are more than adequate for the repeated destruction of mankind. No state or person is immune from the risk of use of nuclear weapons or from the potential effects of use. So long as nuclear stockpiles are retained&#8212;both nuclear war-</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.24" top="325.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="325.65" x1="413.24" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 137.35; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 4.69; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">guarded and vulnerable to theft)&#8212;all states and peoples will be more vulnerable.

The withdrawal of North Korea from the NPT signalled an important blow. The collapse of the May 2005 NPT Review Conference was a further reversal. The failure of the UN World Summit to agree a single sen-tence on the issue signalled the scale of the problem. And the building crisis in the Middle East outlines the dangers. The ongoing unwill-ingness of several of the nuclear weapons states to even acknowledge previous commitments to a 12-step disarmament process is as disheart-ening as it is irresponsible. And most recently, the US-India deal (still unratified), while usefully bringing India&#8217;s nuclear programme into some degree of international oversight, did so at the cost of further </span></div><div left="76.47" right="392.87" top="612.21"><span x0="76.47" y0="612.21" x1="392.87" style="x0: 76.47;

The revelations of the A.Q. Khan smuggling network highlighted the limitations of the NSG&#8217;s approach, though the circumstances under which A.Q. Khan operated were highly specific and difficult to replicate. Nevertheless the threat of smuggling of materials and weapons is a real one. It has been met in small part first by the Nunn-Lugar Initiative (the cre-ation of a private foundation to buy back nuclear materials) and more recently by the promulgation first by the United States and then the G-8 of the Proliferation Security Initiative. In short, political attention to the disarmament agenda has receded, but the threat these weapons pose is growing&#8212;a recipe for mounting risk, possibly disaster. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="142.44" top="395.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="395.65" x1="142.44" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.66; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Elements of a strategy</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.75" top="367.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="367.65" x1="337.75" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 367.65; y1: 377.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">As our report was being finalized, the Blix Commission issued its final report.

As the UN High-Level Panel on Threats, Chal-lenges and Change argued, as these issues arise, case by case, the chances of the international community reaching consensus as to whether such force is or is not appropriate would be enhanced if agreement could be reached by the Security Council (and endorsed by the General  Assembly) on the adoption of a set of criteria to guide its delibera-tions over the use of force. Clear criteria cannot guarantee agreement, but their consistent application&#8212;in conformity with the charter of the United Nations&#8212;would go a long way to help the Security Council avoid critical mistakes&#8212;of action or inaction&#8212;and enhance its per- ceived legitimacy as the ultimate decision-making authority on inter- national peace and security.

Debate in the UN in the follow-up to the Secretary-General&#8217;s sub-mission of these principles to the General Assembly and the Security Council revealed significant support for their acceptance, but a division among the permanent members about the desirability of their adop-tion as formal guidelines. In this, as in other matters, enhancing the legitimacy of the Security Council can only contribute to the process of aligning national and global interests. The alternatives are a Security Council unable to act, or one able to act only against the broad sense of members&#8217; values and interests&#8212;equally unpalatable outcomes. But enhancing the legitimacy of the Security Council will require more than just articulating criteria for the use of force. Rather, the mechanism that has repeatedly blocked action in critical cases&#8212;the veto&#8212;requires attention, if only to try to reach consensus about the limited circumstances in which it should be used. So too does the mem- bership of the body, now as outdated and unrepresentative as to struc-turally weaken its legitimacy and perceived authority. Reforms to the veto and composition of the Security Council would significantly en-hance its authority to act and the capacity to succeed. We address the details in chapter 9. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.23" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="413.23" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 135.68; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 3.02; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">sharing to produce grain that responded more favourably to fertilizer and is credited with fostering major reductions in levels of poverty and hunger in the developing world.</span><span x0="226.33" y0="581.96" x1="231.96" style="x0: 226.33; x1: 229.19; y0: 581.96; y1: 587.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">88</span></div><div left="147.66" right="413.27" top="563.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="563.65" x1="413.27" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.43; y0: 563.65; y1: 573.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The past 20 years have witnessed four major trends in knowledge. First, there has been an enormous increase in the creation of knowledge. Second, there is huge growth in the role of the private sector in gen-erating knowledge, which has become more important economically. Third, the greater openness of borders to products and people and the development of transportation and communications (particularly digital information technologies) have created new global opportunities for accessing and disseminating knowledge. Fourth, the use of intellectual property rights to protect knowledge has restricted access to informa- tion and technologies.

It includes knowledge that is &#8220;graduating&#8221; from intel-lectual property protection with the expiration of patents and copyrights. It includes new scientific findings from basic research for which intel-lectual property protection is not sought (such as the Human Genome Project). And it includes open source software (such as Linux), research tools and databases for which protection is also voluntarily not sought. The issue of intellectual property versus common knowledge is par- ticularly important given the critical role of the private sector in knowl-edge generation. For the most part private companies invest in knowledge generation on the basis of expected returns from intellectual property rights. The very mechanism of intellectual property rights, however, also </span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.7" top="605.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="605.65" x1="337.7" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 59.5; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 2.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">limits the availability of knowledge, turning it from a public into a private good. At the international level significant investments have been made in the free exchange of scientific research findings and results, in some cases supported by public funding, including such international research part- nerships as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Re-search (CGIAR) and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. Another example is the European Organization for Nuclear Research (known as CERN).</span><span x0="101.41" y0="497.96" x1="107.09" style="x0: 101.41; x1: 104.26; y0: 497.96; y1: 503.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">91</span></div><div left="73.26" right="334.93" top="479.65"><span x0="73.26" y0="479.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 73.26; x1: 80.03; y0: 479.65; y1: 489.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">All these initiatives produce scientific breakthroughs and new knowl-edge available to all. Similarly, we emphasize the importance of further efforts to ensure that statistics delivered by governments and compiled or collected by international institutions are openly available. Both systems&#8212;intellectual property and common knowledge&#8212;are needed, but there is no neat formula indicating how much of one rela-tive to the other is desirable. During the past 20 years, the balance between the two kinds of systems has been tilting towards private intel-lectual property. The European Union has adopted a highly restrictive directive on the protection of databases. The United States has ex- panded the scope of patentable research findings, including what oth-erwise would be considered discoveries of nature rather than inventions. And other developed nations have moved to protect business software, plant and animal varieties, genetic sequences and biotechnological re- search tools.</span><span x0="105.16" y0="287.96" x1="110.87" style="x0: 105.16; x1: 108.02; y0: 287.96; y1: 293.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">92</span><span x0="113.6" y0="283.65" x1="337.69" style="x0: 113.6; x1: 119.95; y0: 283.65; y1: 293.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">By far, and somewhat ironically, the most important step to protect intellectual property rights has taken place on the multilateral front with the adoption of the TRIPS agreement. These and other changes in the intellectual property system have resulted in a relative contraction of the common knowledge platform. The knowledge gap between the rich countries and the majority of poor countries is widening and with it the possibilities are reduced of closing the development gap between them. Furthermore the role of knowledge as an input for the production of other global public goods is also being limited by the protection of intellectual property as clearly exemplified by the cases of R&amp;D for disease control and climate change.</span><span x0="87.12" y0="133.96" x1="92.83" style="x0: 87.12; x1: 89.97; y0: 133.96; y1: 139.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">93</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.56" top="115.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="115.65" x1="337.56" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.87; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The Task Force strongly endorses two types of initiatives.

It is essential to ensure additional funding for the institutions already conducting research in these areas, particularly the CGIAR and the various partnerships in the medical sectors. On health, serious con- sideration should be given to the creation of new partnerships, pref-erably a network of research facilities specializing in tropical diseases, guided and financed through an International Consultative Group, as suggested in chapter 3. Second, the Task Force endorses initiatives aimed to balance the ef-fects of TRIPS on developing countries. As mentioned above, accepting TRIPS was the cost paid by developing countries to have the Multifibre Agreement phased out and agriculture brought into the WTO frame-work. It has been estimated that developing countries eventually will be paying close to $60 billion per year in royalties because of the enforce- ment of TRIPS.</span><span x0="197.16" y0="413.96" x1="202.87" style="x0: 197.16; x1: 200.01; y0: 413.96; y1: 419.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">94</span><span x0="206.14" y0="409.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 206.14; x1: 211.04; y0: 409.65; y1: 419.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Some of this cost was supposed to be compensated by the expected benefits stemming from the protection of intellectual property rights, benefits such as increased trade, additional technology transfers and bigger foreign investment flows including the flows di- rected to address specific needs of developing countries&#8212;like combat-ing tropical diseases. The problem is that TRIPS is a bound obligation, whereas the supposed compensating benefits are not. Thus, as is found in other parts of the multilateral trading system, TRIPS is unbalanced against the interests of developing countries. One measure to balance the consequences of TRIPS, albeit only partially, would be the establishment of a multilateral agreement on open access to basic science and technology (ABST).</span><span x0="341.54" y0="259.96" x1="347.26" style="x0: 341.54; x1: 344.4; y0: 259.96; y1: 265.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">95</span></div><div left="147.66" right="413.26" top="241.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="241.65" x1="413.26" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.43; y0: 241.65; y1: 251.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The ABST could have at least five globally beneficial impacts. First, it would help resolve the free-rider problems that reduce investments in science and technology relative to a global optimum. Second, it could restrain the tendency of governments to restrict access and to encourage privatization of basic knowledge. This rebalancing of technology develop-ment norms in favour of expanding the public domain could help vitalize scientific research in many countries while promoting applied innovation. Third, the agreement could provide an important plank for the construc- tion of modern technological capabilities in poor countries while sustain-ing access to information for educational purposes. Fourth, it should not unduly restrict the rights of firms to exploit intellectual property in ap-plied technologies and products. Finally, it could help restore confidence on the part of developing countries that TRIPS and the WTO are institu-</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.73" top="605.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="605.65" x1="337.73" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.87; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The idea of establishing an agreement for ABST is endorsed by this Task Force. The goal of ABST would be to facilitate the transfer of scien-tific knowledge and technological information to developing countries.

It may now be common-place (as the UN High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change  argued) to say that &#8220;development is the indispensable foundation for a collective security system&#8221;, and that there is growing recognition (in the words of the European Security Strategy) that &#8220;security is a precondition of development&#8221;. However, in practice, international negotiations all too often focus on specific problems rather than the links and the priorities among them. Even where economic, security and environmental issues are ad-dressed, they still tend to be treated as separate. There is often a sense that some issues have been included in international agreements to placate different audiences. Clauses on terrorism matter to the West, for example; those on development to the South. They are brought together not because they are interrelated, but as a trade-off between irreconcilable parties, highlighting rather than reducing diverging in- ternational interests.This can be counter-productive, for today&#8217;s challenges cannot be neatly categorized. Economic and environmental concerns foster a ris- ing demand for civilian nuclear power, but given the state of interna-tional controls this brings with it a growing risk of nuclear proliferation. Freer trade increases global prosperity, but the twentieth century dem- onstrated that the alternative of protectionism and unregulated com-petition for resources can undermine security structures. Combating infectious disease is warranted in its own right, but will also have posi-tive side-effects for security and trade. The idea of global public goods reflects such interdependence as a necessary factor in effectively addressing global challenges. In the do- mestic sphere, a competent government inevitably responds to differ-ing interests; farmers and city-dwellers inevitably have separate needs. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="410.5" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.58; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">money supply and police. And a government must balance them; an ad-ministration that concentrated on policing but ignored public finances and health would create not only a powerful gendarmerie, but also an anarchic failed state. At the global level, it is also important to balance policy priori- ties. To focus solely on economic growth without considering its en-vironmental impact will create resource shortages and raise the risk of resource wars. States that combine high security with economic pro-tectionism increase the threats they aim to defend against. If we do not see the generation of global public goods as a process of balancing in-terrelated demands and needs, we may progress in some areas, but the international system will remain fragile, and the risks of crisis escalate. In short, the potential gains from a positive interplay between im-proved peace and security, an expanding sphere of prosperity and the protection of the health of peoples and the environment are substantial indeed. And the consequences of a potential negative spiral of protec-tionism, isolationism, deepening international divisions and an erosion of both security and stability are severe. Urgent action is needed to forestall the former and realize the promise of the latter.The provision of these priorities will require energetic action to reform both the political decision-making and financing mechanisms for national and international action.In Part I we showed that historically catalytic efforts&#8212;often by the most powerful&#8212;were required to provide global public goods. Events of recent years have shown that the prospects for realizing such leader-ship do not lie primarily in formal international institutions. They are vital tools, and their health must be assured. But they are also cumber-some, unable to respond quickly to emerging challenges, unable to act nimbly across different issue areas and unable to generate critical break-throughs on policy and institutional reforms to seize the opportunities available to meet common goals or to avoid shared risks. We conclude, as others have before us, that the best hope for gen-erating the kind of catalytic leadership necessary for the provision of global public goods lies with the establishment of a new, informal forum. We propose, accordingly, a Global 25 forum that brings together the heads of state and government from the developed and developing countries that are the most responsible, capable and representative, as well as relevant representatives of other groups and regions. With ap-propriate links to the formal institutions, such a forum could do much </span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.68" top="605.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="605.65" x1="337.68" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 65.02; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">marries inclusion and agility&#8212;it will be extremely hard to achieve the reforms to international policies, institutions and financing necessary to achieve common goals. But we cannot stress enough that such a catalytic forum must be matched to&#8212;indeed it must strengthen and make more effective&#8212;for- mal institutions and the wider process of negotiation and decision-mak-ing they allow. This process is necessary to ensure that all states have a chance to express their preferences and participate in the authoriza-tion, or rejection, of action, even if the direction is initially set by the Global 25. That the legitimacy of the decision-making mechanisms of the major international institutions is in doubt poses a major obstacle to this process, one requiring structural reform. We thus add our voices to those who have called for reforming the mechanisms and representation of the UN Security Council and the governing bodies of the Interna-tional Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as well as the broader UN system&#8212;reflecting its dual roles in promoting development and managing global issues. The effectiveness of international mechanisms needs also to be en- hanced through improved accountability, starting with greater trans-parency. Such reforms will also aid national mobilization and resource commitments. So will the use of both best practice and new, innovative tools for generating the necessary financing for global public goods. We stress that national governments retain the primary responsibility, as it is in their interest, for ensuring that global public goods are paid for. But there is also a need for reform to improve the use of existing resources and to tap the energy and initiative of the private sector. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.26" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="413.26" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 135.26; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 2.6; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">instruments, institutional summits tend to work within existing agendas and existing frameworks. They are tools for consolidation more than for setting new agendas, and, as a result, often do not enable catalytic action. International summits also tend to reinforce rather than transcend the regional and political groupings for business-as-usual in international institutions. And they operate within the sector-by-sector architecture of the existing system, ignoring or underplaying the intersections and interconnections between issues. Institutional summits will undoubtedly remain a part of the inter-national landscape and will under some circumstances be able to reach agreements on well developed topics. But for catalytic action to jump-start the more effective, more reliable supply of global public goods, more nimble and more political mechanisms are needed. </span><span x0="147.66" y0="423.65" x1="289.2" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 153.29; y0: 423.65; y1: 433.65; width: 5.63; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Political summits: the G-8 and others. </span><span x0="288.82" y0="423.65" x1="413.18" style="x0: 288.82; x1: 298.82; y0: 423.65; y1: 433.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">When formal institutions have been unable to act, international political fora that bring together clusters of national leaders outside formal frameworks have at times filled gaps on an interim basis or catalysed action by taking steps critical to attract the willingness of others to engage and cooperate or to commit resources. There are a myriad of regional and subregional summit fora, as well as summits of political or religious groupings. The best known, and prob-ably the most significant example, is the G-8. Over its history, the G-8 has shown at least an episodic capacity to move issues forward that have been otherwise immobilized within formal institutions.

The G-8 has also launched initiatives that would have been com-plicated to negotiate in a wider institutional framework, required more than a bilateral political framework, and yet benefited far more coun-tries than participated in the launch of the initiative&#8212;such as the G-8&#8217;s Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction in 2002. Through this mechanism the G-8 countries used their considerable financial capacity to pay for the clean-up of the former Soviet Union&#8217;s nuclear stockpiles&#8212;a global good, surely. Another example is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria that was initiated by the G-8 in 2001.Regional groupings most often affect regional action; while the regional level is important, it does not suffice for global action.

While the latter are so large as to be unwieldy, the G-8 is too small for its decisions to generate the kind of broad-based support required for acceptance and implementation through formal institutions. Moreover even when the G-8 takes a forward-leaning step on a rapidly evolving issue, as with the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) in the face of evidence of sea-based movement of nuclear and biological materials and related weapons systems, it does not engage in a wider process of negotiations, causing the PSI to be as much resented as embraced. And even within the G-8&#8217;s original field of focus, international finance, its limited membership is increasingly seen as anachronistic in the face of the changing distribution of wealth and financial influ-ence in the global market. Even measured in traditional gross domestic product (GDP) terms, China now has a larger GDP than two current members of the G-8 (Italy and Canada), and six countries not in-cluded in the G-8 have larger GDPs than Russia (Spain, whose GDP is also larger than Canada&#8217;s; India; the Republic of Korea; Mexico; Australia; and Brazil).</span><span x0="146.05" y0="371.96" x1="151.84" style="x0: 146.05; x1: 148.91; y0: 371.96; y1: 377.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">97</span><span x0="155.84" y0="367.65" x1="337.83" style="x0: 155.84; x1: 165.01; y0: 367.65; y1: 377.65; width: 9.17; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Moreover, looked at in terms of the World Bank&#8217;s preferred tool for measuring wealth and well-being, purchasing power parity, the GDP of China and India combined almost equals the GDP of Japan, the UK, France, Italy, Canada and Germany com- bined.</span><span x0="82.61" y0="315.96" x1="88.38" style="x0: 82.61; x1: 85.46; y0: 315.96; y1: 321.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">98</span><span x0="90.98" y0="311.65" x1="337.8" style="x0: 90.98; x1: 100.98; y0: 311.65; y1: 321.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">When looked at in terms of international financial activity, China&#8217;s exclusion from the G-8 is fundamentally at odds with its major role in international finance and trade.

Catalytic action of this type could then be brought to the formal institutions for broader consultation, wider negotiations and ul-timately rejection or endorsement by the broader community of states. This wider process is absolutely necessary. But the composition of a Global 25 would substantially increase the likelihood that its proposals would generate support and acceptance, and thus implementation. With these core functions there could be additional benefits to such a grouping. It could examine, in ways beyond the capacity of the exist-ing institutions, the inter-connections between issues normally treated separately and create a forum for the heads of the major international institutions to regularly meet and generate more effective collaboration. It could also demand and generate evidence-based research, monitoring and evaluation. And it could encourage innovation in public and private sector financing of global public goods. At this divided international moment, the mere composition of such a forum could send a powerful signal about the need for cooperation, about the importance of bridging regional and political divides and about common global responsibilities to tackle common global ills. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="226.3" top="255.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="255.65" x1="226.3" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.39; y0: 255.65; y1: 265.65; width: 7.29; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Conditions for an effective Global 25 forum</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.68" top="227.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="227.65" x1="337.68" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">A Global 25 forum at the level of heads of state and government could achieve these benefits under three conditions: </span><span x0="72.1" y0="199.65" x1="223.01" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 80.64; y0: 199.65; y1: 209.65; width: 8.54; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Membership as a reflection of contributions. </span><span x0="222.42" y0="199.65" x1="337.65" style="x0: 222.42; x1: 231.59; y0: 199.65; y1: 209.65; width: 9.17; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Membership in such a forum should not be based solely on financial size, population size or military power.

Is it more effective to elect a different 20 based on different criteria or to modify the existing 20 based on broader criteria? We see most merit in an approach based on augmenting the exist- ing G-20&#8212;a cross-regional grouping of states that has significant rep-resentation from emerging powers and all continents and regions and that collectively represent around 90% of global gross national product, 80% of world trade and two-thirds of the world&#8217;s population.</span><span x0="376.58" y0="315.96" x1="385.21" style="x0: 376.58; x1: 379.44; y0: 315.96; y1: 321.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">101</span></div><div left="147.66" right="410.5" top="297.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="297.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 153.6; y0: 297.65; y1: 307.65; width: 5.94; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Even then, two sets of actors would be underrepresented, or not repre-sented at all.

Finally while in the Finance G-20 some impor-tant economic institutions are represented (the IMF, the World Bank and the European Central Bank), the UN is not represented. Ideally the composition of a Global 25 would reflect the greatest contributions to global public goods.

First, there is a broad &#8220;summit fatigue&#8221; in the international system, which adds to resistance to proposals for a new one. Second, countries are typically reluctant to give up any existing summit forum in which they participate. Adding another summit forum would be unpopular for both reasons. A further political obstacle to a Global 25 forum lies in potential resistance from those who will not participate. While those who do not participate stand to gain from agreements and commitments made by a Global 25, the mere fact of non-inclusion tends to rankle national pride and create suspicion. But states that would resist the notion must answer the question, What is the alternative? Formal international institutions have repeatedly proven themselves too cumbersome, too narrowly bound to specific sec- tors, to solve global problems. And while the G-8 has performed impor-tant functions, its narrow membership sharply limits its potential. Without a grouping that marries inclusion with agility, it will be extremely hard to achieve the necessary reforms to international poli-cies, institutions and financing to achieve common goals. The best response to these concerns is to stress that the Global 25 would start as an informal forum. Only once it had proved its value should the questions be addressed of solidifying its forum (including such questions as whether it should have a Secretariat and the like) and resolving its relationship to the G-8 and G-20. A Global 25 forum, if established according to the criteria set here, could have a catalytic effect in the provision of global public goods. But a Global 25 forum can only be catalytic; it cannot be decisive. The broader community of states must have the ability to participate in nego-tiations about global public goods and to react to ideas and proposals from </span></div><div left="147.66" right="413.13" top="605.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="605.65" x1="413.13" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.43; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">This takes us, then, to the question of institutions&#8212;their governance structures through which such negotiations occur and their ability to effectively implement agreements to provide global public goods. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="323.86" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="323.86" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.54; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 6.88; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Regional participation in global decision-making</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.24" top="577.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="577.65" x1="413.24" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.43; y0: 577.65; y1: 587.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">A critical reality of global public goods is that they are contested; states have different interests, values and preferences, even where they share long-term goals. Aligning preferences and setting priorities in a world of 200 states is an acute challenge. In some contexts regional mechanisms are effectively used to agree on common preferences and priorities for inputs to international de-cision-making&#8212;for example, in some of the regional and sub-regional groupings that share board seats at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. In other contexts regional groupings in international mechanisms are out of alignment with regional organi-zations&#8212;as, for example, with the African regional grouping at the UN, which has different presidencies (and often substantially different priorities) from the African Union (AU). The value of a regional approach differs from area to area. Asian re-gionalism is fragmented&#8212;hardly surprising given the size of the region and the vast differences in the types of states that it comprises. The result is that most Asian regional bodies are issue-specific and in all likelihood will remain so in the foreseeable future. Greater Asian representation and voice in international institutions is not likely to occur through a regional approach, but through the inclusion of major Asian powers in the governance mechanisms of those institutions. Latin American coun-tries have long pursued regional integration, but their efforts have only begun to tackle the most difficult challenges that confront the region, including social inequality, organized crime and the regional fallout from internal conflict.</span><span x0="219.79" y0="245.96" x1="228.36" style="x0: 219.79; x1: 222.65; y0: 245.96; y1: 251.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">103</span></div><div left="147.66" right="413.41" top="227.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="227.65" x1="413.41" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.43; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">That said, even within the weaker regional frameworks, there are important examples worth building on. The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has played directly and through its hosting of the ASEAN Regional Forum useful roles in mediating regional conflict (for example in Cambodia) and in calming regional tensions (in the South China Seas). A stronger role for regional institutions is particularly salient in Af-rica. Although countries on the African continent vary as widely in cultural and political terms as do the members of Asian groupings, there is a narrower band of difference in state capacity. The New Economic Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) and reform of the  AU have already strengthened African voices in international fora.

We also highlight the value of tightening the link between the governance mechanisms of regional bodies and their representation in international fora. When, as is sometimes the case, the country or coun-tries that sit in the leadership/chairmanship of regional bodies do not represent that region in international fora, political dynamics open gaps between the regional mechanism and its projection internationally. The EU has begun to bridge this gap through the presidency, but others such as the AU have not yet done so. Regionalism is not, however, an alternative to an overarching frame-work for political and economic cooperation at the international level. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="130.59" top="353.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="353.65" x1="130.59" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 65.12; y0: 353.65; y1: 363.65; width: 8.02; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Governance reform</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.66" top="325.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="325.65" x1="337.66" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">There is no real doubt that restoring public and political confidence in the major international institutions will require reform of their gover-nance mechanisms. But there is great debate over the specifics of those reforms and the principles that should guide them. In the past few years those debates have been clouded by loose ter- minology and confused terms. Frequent recourse is made to the con-cept of &#8220;democratizing&#8221; governance but without a shared concept of democracy or its application to international institutions. The term &#8220;ef-ficiency&#8221; is also used, but in widely differing ways by states seeking to further their national claims. So is the concept of &#8220;changed distribution of power&#8221;, used to argue both for broadening the participation of ris-ing powers and for narrowing it to the hyper-powerful. And all of these terms have been used at times to promote reforms that do little more than reward stature, rather than encourage commitment. Still there is no getting around the great deal of disquiet within a wide range of constituencies about current governance arrangements&#8212;dis- quiet that impedes reform agendas and the core work of the major in-ternational institutions, whether it is widespread skepticism of Security Council decision-making surrounding questions of terrorism and nuclear </span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.27" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="413.27" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 136.62; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 3.96; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">attached to IMF and World Bank lending. There is a generalized sense in political discourse that only the post-war powers meaningfully participate in governance decisions. Yet Asia has growing financial, political and mili-tary clout. Africa is creating new opportunities for itself. And several states, including in East Asia and Latin America, have grown so much in size and regional reach that weaknesses in their formal decision-making roles im-pedes the implementation of international programmes and mandates. We believe that an approach based on the requirements of produc-ing global public goods can be useful in providing pathways to reform. What our report shows is that the very nature of global public goods requires a combination of responsible leadership by those states that have extensive financial and political capacity to contribute, as well as a wider process of legitimization, reflecting state preferences and coor-dinating interests. Unless those with financial and political power are willing to shoul-der their responsibilities, no international institution is able to perform its basic mandate. From the outset of our current system, the notion that powerful states should have extra responsibilities has been embedded in institutional governance. But the current architecture lacks mechanisms to modify the nature of representation in governance mechanisms as power and capability shift. Across the board we believe that international institutions would be strengthened with integrated mechanisms to modify their gover-nance arrangements as state capabilities shifted, including, for example, weighted voting (linked to contributions and population) or linking membership to specific contributions. With respect to the core mandate of the institution in question, different measurements could be adopted, encompassing percentage of world GDP, scale of financial transactions, share of peacekeeping contributions and so on. Obviously if such measures are adopted, great debate will be ex-pended over precisely which measures of capacity to contribute to use. We believe that approaches that involve flexible participation based on specific capacity are preferable, because they create incentives for ac-tion and rewards for contributions, encouraging national commitments rather than simply rewarding status. Weighted voting is one such mecha-nism. Another, adopted by the World Bank&#8217;s International Development Association and the UN in creating the Peacebuilding Commission, is having seats at the table that reflect sustained contributions as well as the more traditional standard of regional representation.</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.6" top="605.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="605.65" x1="337.6" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 79.7; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 7.6; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Debating state preference is more difficult but equally important. Global public goods must be perceived to be so, in values or interest terms, by a large majority of states involved in their production. Oth-erwise implementation will be near impossible. However, in a world of 200 states, we can not base our approach on the idea that all states will always meaningfully be able to share their preferences about the value of a given global public good. Even in the UN General Assembly, which comes closest to a forum for all states to express their interests and prefer-ences across a range of global issues, the reality is that regional groupings (slightly odd ones) and political groupings (out of date ones) actually take up most of the negotiating oxygen in the General Assembly&#8217;s chambers. Highly selective groupings&#8212;such as the G-8 and the UN Security Council&#8212;are able to reach agreement on priorities, but are less and less able to persuade non-members of the legitimacy of their decisions. This has been starkly shown in the Security Council, not only around spe-cific crises such as Iraq, but also in efforts to set mandatory international standards for non-proliferation and counter-terrorism. It is also seen in international political reactions to G-8 proposals, though the group has done somewhat more to begin to adapt, including more consultation with non-members. Moving forward, we believe that the international capacity to meet the growing demand and the urgent need for global public goods re-quires institutional reforms that increase the participation of a wider band of states willing to demonstrate responsibility and to sustain com-mitments. They must also reflect the political reality that unless our institutions are able to persuade and to legitimize, they will not be ef-fective. Governance reforms must also bring into the decision-making system states, especially among emerging powers, with a capacity to help legitimize decisions. The perceived legitimacy and production of priority global public goods would be enhanced if the IMF and the World Bank adopted governance reforms giving greater weight to under-represented na-tions and if the UN made reforms to the Security Council, ideally both to its membership and to its veto mechanism, and to the broader UN system as a whole. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="214.7" top="101.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="101.65" x1="214.7" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 60.85; y0: 101.65; y1: 111.65; width: 3.75; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">IMF and World Bank governance reform</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.7" top="73.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="73.65" x1="337.7" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 73.65; y1: 83.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The provision of global public goods would be improved by changes to </span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.21" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="413.21" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 135.58; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 2.92; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">tive board.

The Security Council&#8217;s ability to maintain international peace and security would be strengthened by reforms to its membership and to the veto.

One is replacing the veto by a system of weighted voting, which would still provide reassurance to the most powerful but would broaden real participation by elected members in the Security Council&#8217;s decision-making. Somewhat more realistically (since it does not involve having a permanent member agree to give up their veto per se), a second option is instituting a system of double vetoes&#8212;a system that would require at least two veto-holding members to vote negatively to block a Security Council decision&#8212;for instances when the Security Council faces issues most damaging to international peace and security, especially crimes against humanity.It is worth noting that had such a mechanism been in place, the Secu-rity Council would likely have voted in a timely way to take action in Kosovo and Darfur.  If such reform to the veto is not possible, which regrettably seems to be the case at this time, membership reform should not add to the problem by bringing in new veto-wielding members; this would only further limit the Security Council&#8217;s ability to act. An interim option is to add elected, but renewable, seats to the Security Council, open primar- ily to the states within regional groupings that make the largest finan-cial, military and political commitments to the UN&#8212;the &#8220;Option B&#8221; proposed by the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. Efforts to promote &#8220;Option A&#8221;&#8212;new permanent seats&#8212;ran aground at the UN in 2005 and generated significant political divisions within the membership. Option B has two advantages. First, it links representation within institutional governance structures to the engagement and commit-ment of states&#8212;a point that can assist in making the case to domestic constituencies for sustaining engagement at the global level.

Specifically, we believe that the UN system&#8212;in particular, its specialized agencies&#8212;has a critical role to play in the provision of issue-specific knowledge and coordination of action to negotiate and to implement agreements for the provision of global public goods. And independent evaluation of the performance of UN agencies, funds and programmes would help enhance their credibility. Greater use of evidence-based research and more consistent monitor-ing of state compliance with international obligations would allow UN system entities to report on global developments and serve as centres of specialized knowledge, as hubs of professional networks, of interest to all countries. In short, it would allow them to play a more pro-active role on global issues and in shaping the provision of global public goods. Such reforms are necessary to enhance the accountability of interna-tional institutions both within the UN system and beyond. We now turn to these reforms in greater detail.</span></div><div left="132.66" right="203.56" top="129.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="129.8" x1="203.56" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.51; y0: 129.8; y1: 139.8; width: 6.85; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Accountability </span></div><div left="132.66" right="410.5" top="101.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="101.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.58; y0: 101.65; y1: 111.65; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Here we elaborate a set of reforms that would generate improved trans-parency&#8212;a critical component of accountability.

Too much of the international sphere is taken up with interventions that have at best a tenuous basis for the connection between the intervention and the nature of the problem. And far too little is done to develop and apply cost-benefit analysis to interventions. Evidence of a connection between the problem and the designed solution and cost-benefit analysis are both useful in convincing sceptical publics, parliaments and paymas-ters to provide the necessary investments in global public goods. The lack of adequate research into causal relationships bedevils pol-icy development on terrorism prevention, on post-conflict economic aid and other major spheres of international cooperation. The research that emanates from international institutions in their own issue areas is often methodologically weak or politically shaped; much could be done to im-prove the independence and rigour of research within institutions. The governing boards of international institutions should promote indepen-dent peer review and related tools to enhance the quality of and reliability of in-house research. And foundation and government sponsors of inde-pendent research should encourage deeper work on these questions. One problem is the lack of research and data; the other is sourcing. In the context of national and international debates about whether to support new investments in global public goods, vested interests that stand to lose from the enhanced provision of a particular global public good (such as reduced tariff protection) may exaggerate the costs and minimize the benefits to the country. To counterbalance such sources of misinformation, it is essential that credible independent information and analysis be available to inform public debate. One important source of information can come from the research departments of selected global and regional institutions, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The value and influence of such work would be stronger were such departments to develop a joint or well coordinated research programme </span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.2" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="413.2" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 137.66; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">public goods recommendations.

Governments often agree to international solutions that contain no provision for monitoring their compliance with obligations. Without monitoring it is impossible to design incentives for performance or sanctions. Here again we stress that if governments are not willing to relinquish some sovereign controls and provide institutions with the relevant authority to monitor their own compliance, they will seldom succeed in solving critical global challenges. When international agreements contain provisions for mon-itoring compliance, the odds of success rise significantly. Any systems of monitoring compliance have to be both indepen- dent and equitable. Any that are selective are doomed to political fail-ure. All states have responsibility for the production of global public goods and an interest in their achievements. Thus all states&#8217; performance should be monitored on an equal basis. Transparent monitoring and reporting are critical for mobilizing public opinion and for accountability&#8212;both before agreements are reached and during implementation. They are particularly useful in identifying free riders. At present, monitoring of country performance is decidedly limited and uneven. Among international organizations, only the IMF systematically monitors country performance through its Article IV Consultations, reflecting its findings in the </span><span x0="368.04" y0="115.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 368.04; x1: 377.62; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 9.58; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">World Eco-nomic Outlook </span><span x0="190.02" y0="101.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 190.02; x1: 193.98; y0: 101.65; y1: 111.65; width: 3.96; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">and other publications.

The Interna-tional Atomic Energy Agency&#8217;s (IAEA) annual report is another good example, closely monitoring country implementation of agreed proto- cols in all countries where it is deployed. But the lack of credible, inde-pendent monitoring of all countries&#8217; compliance with broader features of the non-proliferation regime diminishes the overall political value of IAEA reporting.

Other institutions do less. Partly to fill the void, other actors&#8212;both in the official sector and in the policy research community&#8212;have launched monitoring initiatives, such as the Security Council Report, which tracks the decisions and actions of members of the UN Security Council, and the Canadian Centre for Treaty Compliance.</span><span x0="230.6" y0="399.96" x1="239.11" style="x0: 230.6; x1: 233.46; y0: 399.96; y1: 405.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">112</span><span x0="240.42" y0="395.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 240.42; x1: 250.42; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">While many of these ef-forts are excellent, they do not add up to a coherent information base for policy-makers and private citizens to gauge progress, assess comparative country performance and determine priorities for action. Nor is there an agreed basis for evaluating international organizations&#8217; performance and results or a baseline for tracking progress over time. Most regional and international organizations, as part of their re-form programmes, need to upgrade their monitoring and surveillance functions. To this end a concerted investment programme by interna- tional agencies is needed to develop and analyse data sources on coun-try compliance with their obligations, which will also contribute to strengthening their surveillance functions. The best approach is to build stringent reporting requirements into regional and international agreements. A strong example is the Mon- treal Protocol, which built effective monitoring and reporting require-ments into the basic agreement, with carrots and sticks attached to the outcome of that reporting. There is also value in additional, voluntary reporting standards. For natural resource revenue management in fragile states, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) was launched at the Johan- nesburg Summit of September 2002 and endorsed by the G-8 Meet-ing of 2004, building on a non-governmental organization (NGO) campaign, &#8220;Publish What You Pay&#8221;. Its purpose is to encourage, on a voluntary basis, greater transparency in the revenues that compa-</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.25" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="413.25" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 136.93; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 4.27; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">concerns. One is that companies have not been subject to adequate scrutiny and so have evaded payments to which governments were entitled. The other is that public officials have diverted payments that should have gone into the budget into improper uses. For both, trans-parency in reporting payments makes scrutiny more feasible. The EITI is a modest start, but could usefully be strengthened and extended to other natural resource sectors, such as forestry and fisheries.</span><span x0="372.88" y0="525.96" x1="381.57" style="x0: 372.88; x1: 375.74; y0: 525.96; y1: 531.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">113</span></div><div left="147.66" right="410.5" top="507.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="507.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.43; y0: 507.65; y1: 517.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Another mechanism warranting deeper use is peer review. Pio-neered (at the international level) by the OECD and recently adopted by the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) and the new UN Human Rights Council, peer-review processes have the ad-vantages of being equitable, by definition, and of reinforcing a sense of partnership and cooperation. A disadvantage is that peer-review mecha-nisms can create mutual interest among parties in each having the other down-play reports of violations, non-compliance and so on. Another alternative is independent national mechanisms reporting on their own states&#8217; performance. The US General Accounting Office has access to both open-source and confidential government docu-mentation, as well as powers to subpoena information. Its reports are highly credible and provide a solid, independent base of information to judge government performance. The advantage of national mechanisms is political: national constituencies are more likely to mobilize around independent national reporting than international reporting. National reports can be cumulated at the regional or international level to pro- vide an overview of state performance.All four mechanisms can usefully be complemented by academic and NGO-based monitoring. Human rights organizations have set a high benchmark here, providing across-the-board monitoring of states&#8217; human rights performance on an independent basis. Increasing use of similar reporting in the peace and security area&#8212;for example, by the International Crisis Group&#8212;is already proving beneficial in stimulating national accountability for states&#8217; performance. In international negotiations, governments should adopt formal monitoring mechanisms to accompany international agreements.</span></div><div left="132.66" right="224.87" top="115.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="115.65" x1="224.87" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.22; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Evaluating performance</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.26" top="87.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="87.65" x1="413.26" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.58; y0: 87.65; y1: 97.65; width: 7.92; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Using evidence-based research for policy-making and monitoring state compliance will provide important benchmarks for conducting proper </span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.74" top="605.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="605.65" x1="337.74" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 62.1; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">pendent and repeated over time, can significantly enhance the ability of leaders to target investments in global public goods and to mobilize domestic support.

IMF&#8217;s Independent Evaluation Office is perhaps the most independent. Among UN funds, programmes and agencies, and among bilateral agencies, independent evaluation is episodic at best. In the realm of peace and security there is very little evaluation of either policies or initiatives, independent or otherwise. The UN Depart-ment of Peacekeeping Operations has a best-practices section, which now routinely conducts after-action reviews and makes these available publicly. But it is under the managerial responsibility of the department and cannot be seen as independent of the operations it evaluates. Oc-casional use of outside evaluators helps but is inconsistent. And in other areas&#8212;preventive diplomacy, mediation, counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation and disarmament&#8212;there is no culture of evaluation, little empirical research bases and less political will to open up to scrutiny.</span><span x0="323.97" y0="245.96" x1="332.48" style="x0: 323.97; x1: 326.82; y0: 245.96; y1: 251.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">116</span></div><div left="72.1" right="334.93" top="227.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="227.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.87; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The standard for evaluation is set by the public health sector. Al-most all developed country public health systems have strong cultures of policy and intervention evaluation, rigorous independent methodolo-gies for conducting evaluations and a policy culture that looks to the outcome of evaluation when deciding about policy interventions. Cost-benefit analysis is a well established feature of the political and policy process. Even for tough ethical questions, cost-benefit analysis is part of the equation. This clearly strengthens the sector&#8217;s performance and its ability to attract sustained political support and public investment.

A consolidated set of such reports could be provided to the Global 25 forum, providing it with a solid eviden-tiary basis for debate and action. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="252.03" top="465.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="465.65" x1="252.03" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.89; y0: 465.65; y1: 475.65; width: 8.23; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Other aspects of accountability</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.23" top="437.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="437.65" x1="413.23" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 138.6; y0: 437.65; y1: 447.65; width: 5.94; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Evidence, monitoring and evaluation are essential parts of a strategy to enhance transparency. So too are reforms to ensure greater transparency in the selection of the heads of international institutions. We commend the UN Secretary-General for his recent efforts to make the selection of senior officials more transparent and urge other institutions to adopt similar reforms. If greater transparency is to have its desired effect, two changes will be needed. First, regional and international institutions must be adapted to provide penalties for non-compliance; transparency mechanisms will have most effect if linked to mechanisms to enforce international agree-ments. Second, national governments must be held more effectively to account for their fulfilment of international commitments. At the international level, our report in Part II proposed a number of specific measures to strengthen the role of international mechanism in ensuring state compliance. As for the necessary work at the national level, it is beyond the role of this Task Force to propose necessary reforms to domestic system to engender greater accountability for governments&#8217; fulfilment of their in- ternational commitments. Such reforms must of necessity arise from do-mestic action. Here civil society has a critical role to play. In a compelling recent example the Ford Foundation has helped to establish TrustAfrica, an initiative designed to generate from within African countries the de- mand for action against violence, corruption and similar ills. Among in-ternational NGOs, organizations like Oxfam, Transparency International and Amnesty International have been leaders in promoting domestic ac-countability for international action. There is no substitute for domestic, civic action to generate real accountability of this kind. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.7" top="493.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="493.65" x1="337.7" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 62.0; y0: 493.65; y1: 503.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Stronger national engagement and leadership on global issues are critical for determining the appropriate policy and institutional frameworks and setting priorities for the provision of global public goods, thereby also determining financing needs. Similarly, national governments bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that fi-nancing needs for global public goods are met through direct public funding and appropriate incentives and regulatory frameworks that stimulate private funding and the use of market mechanisms. Nations will gain major benefits by increasing their expenditure on global public goods. Initial cost-benefit analyses of various global public goods confirm that money spent on providing them can produce sig-nificant savings compared to the cost of dealing with the ills that arise when such goods are not provided, including financial shocks, spread of new diseases, nuclear proliferation crises and so on. Indeed past experi-ence demonstrates very high benefit-cost ratios for global public goods. This suggests that significant additional expenditures on global public goods are well justified. And with greater provision of global public goods, investments in development will also reap greater returns.Governments can also do more to tap the energy and initiative of the private sector, including civil society, and to take advantage of the specialized knowledge they can bring to bear. Examples include recent developments in emission permit trading and advance mar- ket commitments for new vaccines. We can foresee market-based ap-proaches being expanded to address other global issues, in particular in the areas of health, environmental services and knowledge. Such extensions do, however, require the involvement of governments to provide the necessary regulatory framework. Even then, however, for governments to convince sceptical publics of the value of investing in global public goods they will have to insti-tute reforms to make better use of resources. In short, we recommend in this chapter a five-part strategy for the </span></div><div left="57.1" right="200.76" top="587.87"><span x0="57.1" y0="587.87" x1="200.76" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 70.8; y0: 587.87; y1: 607.87; width: 13.7; font-size: 20.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Adequate and Appropriate Financing: Why?

As governments begin to devote more resources to global public goods, some are concerned that this will draw spending away from tra-ditional development assistance. Official development assistance and the financing of global public goods are not the same, but they interact in several ways.</span><span x0="363.34" y0="301.96" x1="371.91" style="x0: 363.34; x1: 366.19; y0: 301.96; y1: 307.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">118</span><span x0="375.46" y0="297.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 375.46; x1: 380.77; y0: 297.65; y1: 307.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">First, the purposes of the funding often coincide. Second, each can either supple-ment or crowd out the other. Third, providing global public goods can enhance or reduce the effectiveness of aid, and vice versa. The fight against avian flu and other infectious diseases illustrates this particularly well. Surveillance of the disease, research for a vaccine and more effective treatments are global public goods. But the effec-tiveness of surveillance and the distribution of vaccines and treatments ultimately depend on the capacity of the health sector of developing countries, including trained personnel and basic infrastructure. Building such capacity is an important component of development programmes. Therefore, capacity building&#8212;what is traditionally considered an ele-ment of development assistance&#8212;is also a vital ingredient of supplying a global public good.Consequently the financing of certain aspects of global public goods often comes from donor countries&#8217; development budgets&#8212;for example, in the areas of capacity building to control communicable </span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.54" top="605.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="605.65" x1="337.54" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 61.37; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 4.27; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">change. But the relationship sometimes also goes in the other direction; for instance, the financing of international peace building and enforce-ment, which is not considered development assistance, contributes to the reduction of poverty. There are, however, major gaps in financing arrangements. Most donor countries, for example, have few funding sources to pay for global public goods activities in less developed countries except for where they can be considered to fall within official development assistance (ODA). Moreover, since many donor countries are focusing on poverty reduc-tion in the poorest countries and therefore significantly narrowing the list of countries to which ODA is allocated, there are even fewer tools for paying for global public goods activities in the far wider set of coun-tries that will need to be involved. Two examples illustrate this, drawing from our priorities: paying for counter-terrorism capacity building in countries that are not among the least developed, and funding for capital account crisis programmes, such as those in East Asia in the late 1990s. Neither is typically counted as ODA, reasonably; but because of this, both tend to go underfinanced. Going forward the international community will have to ensure that funding the provisions of global public goods is made on their own merits, that the development purposes of ODA are not eroded and that additional funds are mobilized. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="136.71" top="283.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="283.65" x1="136.71" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.66; y0: 283.65; y1: 293.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Benefits to financing</span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="255.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="255.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 62.41; y0: 255.65; y1: 265.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Financing global public goods can generate important returns, nation-ally and globally, economic and social. Whereas at the national level, finance ministries and legislators have become accustomed to assessing public expenditure in terms of cost-benefit analysis, such thinking is still largely in its infancy in the sphere of international cooperation. This has the disadvantage of largely con-fining international expenditure to the realm of the &#8220;voluntary&#8221; or &#8220;aid&#8221; sectors, for which there are limited constituencies in some national con-texts. (With important exceptions&#8212;witness the extraordinary response, both official and unofficial, to humanitarian needs in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean Tsunami.)

But cost-benefit analysis of this type&#8212;especially if refined by evidence-based research, as argued in chapter 9&#8212;can certainly be helpful in establishing priori-ties and in mobilizing domestic support for financing, both in terms of shoring up support for existing commitments and for necessary addi-tional commitments. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="328.73" top="423.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="423.8" x1="328.73" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 66.54; y0: 423.8; y1: 433.8; width: 9.44; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Who?

It is in states&#8217; interest to do so, as it is their citizens and their private sectors that benefit. This case needs to be made more consistently and more effectively to national parliaments and political constituencies. The financially strong states have particular responsibilities here, though not exclusive ones. If the supply of global public goods is to be addressed, these states will have to accept their responsibilities and make additional and increasing financial commitments. But states can also do much more to mobilize the market and harness its power, as they increasingly do in the sphere of traditional national public policy. With the correct incentives and disincentives in place, the market can be a powerful tool through which to provide global public goods. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="120.89" top="199.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="199.65" x1="120.89" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.81; y0: 199.65; y1: 209.65; width: 7.71; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">National action </span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="171.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="171.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 171.65; y1: 181.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The national level is critical in the supply of global public goods.

Traditionally international matters were the preserve of foreign ministries. As the global dimensions of national policy have been amplified in sector after sector, the ability of foreign ministries to serve as central coordinating mechanisms for foreign and global policy has lagged in all sectors of government. Individual ministers and government departments thus can and often do pursue national policies that have foreign or global effects that are contrary to foreign or global policies in other sectors of the same government&#8212;a suboptimal system at best. Some national governments are exploring ways to achieve coherence and broad ownership of their international policies.Examples include the policy coherence unit in the Netherlands, Sweden&#8217;s global development policy as decided by parliament and a whole of government approach in Australia&#8212;processes for integrating all policy areas in the work to achieve common goals in international engagements. As the regional and global dimensions of national policy grow in importance, further innovations to manage the national-regional-global relationship will be required. In Europe some have called for EU affairs ministries to coor- dinate the EU dimensions of national policy.</span><span x0="231.14" y0="343.96" x1="239.66" style="x0: 231.14; x1: 234.0; y0: 343.96; y1: 349.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">130</span></div><div left="72.1" right="334.93" top="325.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="325.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.87; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Another question is how national finance systems account for spend- ing on foreign and global policy questions. In Canada, the Prime Min-ister&#8217;s Office initiated a two-track budgeting system designed to ensure that national ministries pay out of their own resource allocation for the international mechanisms they benefit from. More common is for na-tional ministries to look to ODA budgets to pay for policies that relate less to development and more to national sector policy initiatives. In the absence of separate systems for financing global policy and global public goods, using development funds is the only option for national ministries that do not have significant budgets for foreign expenditure&#8212;again, a suboptimal system at best.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="171.65" x1="173.42" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.25; y0: 171.65; y1: 181.65; width: 6.15; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Building national capacity. </span><span x0="175.05" y0="171.65" x1="337.74" style="x0: 175.05; x1: 181.4; y0: 171.65; y1: 181.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Because the provision of global public goods requires action by many states, not just developed ones, an addi-tional requirement is improving measures to build capacity.

For example, multilateral cooperation may un-dermine the capacity of national systems. Vertical or issue-specific programmes can have positive impacts on developing country capaci- ties, but they can also impose a heavy toll on human resource and in-stitutional development. Global issue-specific programmes in health have often undercut existing capacities by failing to build sustainable health systems, fragmenting health services and distorting the alloca-tion of scarce human and financial resources. Because global issue-specific programmes usually cannot be sustained without the support of local systems, most developing countries need help in building their general administrative systems and programmes. In truth the international aid community knows much less than it needs to about how external aid works to build national capacity. However recent studies have demonstrated that the World Bank, with its expe-rience and resources for running capacity-building programmes, has the potential to do more to develop local capacities and facilitate the absorption of global vertical programmes.</span><span x0="299.84" y0="329.96" x1="308.34" style="x0: 299.84; x1: 302.7; y0: 329.96; y1: 335.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">134</span><span x0="311.12" y0="325.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 311.12; x1: 317.89; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The UN&#8217;s role in devel-oping state capacity is under study by the High-Level Panel on UN  System-wide Coherence.

And they offer the double dividend of enhanced efficiency and freeing up government re-sources.

Governments es- tablish regulatory frameworks&#8212;by setting standards and assigning prop-erty rights&#8212;and create incentives.

More recently with the entry into force of the Kyoto Pro-tocol and the creation of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, a market for carbon dioxide emissions permits has emerged and several trading exchanges across Europe have been created. The Kyoto Protocol fur-thermore allows for mechanisms that permit richer countries to offset their carbon dioxide emissions against the emissions prevented when technology that reduces greenhouse gas emissions is deployed in poor countries.Another example is the use of advance market commitments, which have been under discussion in the G-8 since Gleneagles in 2005&#8212;namely the use of official and charitable funds to guarantee a minimum price and volume for the purchase of a vaccine. This mecha- nism creates incentives for the private sector to invest in medical re-search. By limiting the risks associated with an uncertain market, this helps to motivate significant R&amp;D investments necessary in producing certain vaccines, especially those required to tackle infectious diseases in the developing world. The growing depth and breadth of financial markets have led to market actors offering instruments that governments can use to manage their risks. Such instruments include growth-indexed sovereignty bonds, which provide issuing countries with an insurance policy to reduce debt service obligations to bond holders if economic performance stalls. An-other example is futures and options, which help mitigate the challenges of commodity price volatility. Market-based approaches could be expanded to address global issues, in particular in the areas of health, environmental services and knowl-edge. This requires the involvement of public sector actors to provide the necessary regulatory framework.</span></div><div left="132.66" right="270.98" top="157.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="157.8" x1="270.98" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 140.07; y0: 157.8; y1: 167.8; width: 7.41; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">How?

For replenishments to be successful, there should be broad participa-tion, and the financial burden should be fairly shared. How can this be achieved? First, by benchmarking contributions to benefits and ability/capacity to pay. Negotiated burden-sharing arrangements should be made as explicit as possible. Explicit shares provide a benchmark against which performance can be judged. A country&#8217;s failure to contribute a previously pledged amount provides an effective lever for the international commu-nity to encourage its fulfilment. Second, we can make use of benefit estimates to guide negotiations on burden sharing. To justify a country&#8217;s contribution, a government must be able to demonstrate that it is paying the country&#8217;s fair share. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="410.5" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 136.93; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 4.27; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">contribute in proportion to the benefit received. Such estimates&#8212;al-though often difficult to establish&#8212;are helpful for policy-makers when examining the total package of contributions for global public goods made by countries. The International Maritime Organization represents this principle the best; membership costs are in proportion to the rela-tive size of a country&#8217;s merchant fleet. Third, it is important that all countries with sufficient capacity par-ticipate and contribute financially in replenishments. This is increasingly the case today with emerging economies participating and contributing in all major replenishments. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="308.88" top="451.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="451.65" x1="308.88" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 136.41; y0: 451.65; y1: 461.65; width: 3.75; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Improve national systems for global financing</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.03" top="423.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="423.65" x1="413.03" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 135.99; y0: 423.65; y1: 433.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">If funding for global public goods is to be additional to ODA, as it should be, states will have to adapt their national spending systems in four ways: </span><span x0="147.66" y0="380.72" x1="156.51" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 380.72; y1: 394.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="381.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 176.68; y0: 381.65; y1: 391.65; width: 8.02; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Revise national budget mechanisms to allow for greater flex-ibility in spending abroad, including by the creation of new mechanisms for more flexible use of domestic, sectoral budgets to pay for international activities and capacity building within those sectors. </span><span x0="147.66" y0="310.72" x1="156.44" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 310.72; y1: 324.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="311.65" x1="413.22" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 175.43; y0: 311.65; y1: 321.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Adopt dual-track national budgeting systems to ensure that global sectoral spending is properly allocated in national budgets and not incorrectly allocated against development budgets.</span><span x0="147.66" y0="268.72" x1="157.28" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 268.72; y1: 282.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="269.65" x1="413.29" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 175.43; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Track expenditure on global public goods by introducing a line item for them in the OECD statistics (see below).</span><span x0="147.66" y0="240.72" x1="157.28" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 152.62; y0: 240.72; y1: 254.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.66" y0="241.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 168.66; x1: 173.97; y0: 241.65; y1: 251.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Fulfil pledges for increased allocations for development assis- tance, ensuring that sufficient resources are provided for de-velopment activities that are also critical for the provision of global public goods (such as health sector capacity building).One way to capture additional spending would be to introduce a line item for global public goods in the OECD statistics.</span><span x0="365.53" y0="175.96" x1="374.14" style="x0: 365.53; x1: 368.39; y0: 175.96; y1: 181.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">141</span><span x0="377.87" y0="171.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 377.87; x1: 382.77; y0: 171.65; y1: 181.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Such an item would only include contributions for the purposes of global public goods that are not considered official development assistance.

This would be helpful in gen-erating domestic support for global public goods spending. Global public goods spending should also be among the metrics used to shape participation in a Global 25 forum.Given the nature of global public goods, it is important in this context that the OECD elaborates its mechanisms for cooperation within the con-text of their growing cooperation with the major developing economies, who are increasingly important contributors to global public goods. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="217.6" top="423.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="423.65" x1="217.6" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 67.73; y0: 423.65; y1: 433.65; width: 10.63; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Work with the private sector and markets</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.7" top="395.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="395.65" x1="337.7" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.5; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 7.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Governments should also do more to tap the energy and initiative of the private sector (including civil society) and markets and to take advantage of the specialized knowledge they can bring to bear, as discussed ear-lier in this chapter.

The purpose of these new sources would pri-marily be social development and poverty eradication, but many are also being advanced against the background of a growing need for continu- ous and predictable financial flows for global public goods purposes.Some of the emerging ideas are politically controversial.

Others are concerned that so-called &#8220;global taxes&#8221; are a first step towards &#8220;world government&#8221;. Despite such critiques, the international instruments through which any global charge is levied remains under the supervi-sion of sovereign states. The international community has examined a whole range of ideas. Among them are a tax on foreign currency transactions (or Tobin Tax), collected on a national or market basis, covering a range of transactions to be defined (such as futures, swaps and other derivatives); the cre-ation of additional special drawing rights by the IMF for development purposes, with donor countries making their Special Drawing Right allocation available to developing countries; creation of a global lot-tery, operated through national state-operated and state-licensed lotteries with proceeds shared between national participants and an independent foundation established in conjunction with the UN; and global devel-opment bonds, a new asset class of debt security that mobilizes capital in a systematic manner on capital markets for the purpose of financing environmentally sustainable projects in developing countries. While many of these approaches offer interesting economic and po-litical benefits, we have chosen to focus on three alternative approaches, two of which have already reached some early stage of implementation. The airline ticket solidarity contribution and the International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFim) are the furthest developed of the new and innovative sources, while carbon taxes would probably deliver the highest return as it would have both a carbon-emission-reducing effect and raise new international finance.</span><span x0="147.66" y0="227.65" x1="299.81" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.22; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">The airline ticket solidarity contribution. </span><span x0="300.22" y0="227.65" x1="413.26" style="x0: 300.22; x1: 306.99; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Among the most advanced in this range of new ideas is the airline ticket solidarity contribution.

Other countries that have agreed to participate are Brazil, Congo, C&#710;ote d&#8217;Ivoire, Cyprus, Gabon, Jordan, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Mauritius, Nicaragua, Norway and the United Kingdom. According to early estimates, the contribution from this mechanism in France alone will generate up to 200 million Euros annually. All other countries of the initiative will raise approximately the same amount as a group. The United Kingdom, which already raises $1.8 billion a year from the taxation of commercial flights, has committed to allocate a percentage of this revenue to the initiative. The introduction of airline ticket contributions is expected to pro- vide stable and predictable resources to, inter alia, help cover the recur-rent costs of health programmes in developing countries. Some of the revenue will be used to fund purchases of medical products, mainly antiretroviral treatment of HIV/AIDS.

It is a pilot version of the International Finance Facility (IFF) which was proposed by the British government. Essentially participants in the IFF would be required to make a legally binding long-term commitment. With this commitment the IFF can raise money immediately on the international capital markets by issuing bonds, which the participants are obliged to pay as they mature some 8&#8211;15 years into the future.

A car-bon tax produces a double dividend: reduced carbon emissions and increased revenues. Five countries have implemented a national carbon tax: Finland, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden. New Zealand will soon also introduce a national carbon tax. Substantial benefits could be realized by the use of carbon taxes in all states at agreed levels based on the principle of common but dif-ferentiated responsibility, and we urge governments to consider their adoption. They could contribute towards the financing of critically im-portant global public goods. And they could do much to mitigate global warming by reducing emissions and redirecting resources towards the development of alternative energy sources. </span></div><div left="132.66" right="195.42" top="297.8"><span x0="132.66" y0="297.8" x1="195.42" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 139.15; y0: 297.8; y1: 307.8; width: 6.49; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Summing up </span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.3" top="269.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="269.65" x1="413.3" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 135.99; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">If the sphere of inter-state cooperation is currently rather gloomy, it is inspiring to see the level of energy and innovation emanating from the growing engagement of private and civil society actors&#8212;actors, more-over, who do not cleave to regional and political divisions that erode the prospects for cooperation among states. Innovative partnerships be- tween such actors and governments are likely to be an ever more im-portant part of the process by which global public goods are financed. Indeed, this innovation and energy is an uplifting note on which to wrap up our analysis. Of course highlighting this innovation does not mean that the fun- damental responsibility of states is to be neglected.

The first step is to enhance the prospects for catalytic action and re-sponsible leadership by creating a forum in which those states with the greatest capabilities can make the necessary commitments and generate the necessary political momentum towards both the implementation of specific strategies and the adoption of systemic reforms. Specifically we call for the establishment of an informal forum, the Global 25, bringing together those states and relevant representatives of other groups and regions in a group small enough to allow substantive discussion and fo- cused initiative, yet sufficiently inclusive to be legitimate and effective. The second step involves reform of both regional and interna-tional institutions to ensure that their governing mechanisms are widely viewed as legitimate. We call for reforms to the governing mechanisms of the IMF and the World Bank, and to the UN Security Council, as well as for broader UN system reform. In the absence of such reforms, the &#8220;good&#8221; in global public goods will be contested, and implementa-tion will suffer. Both sets of reforms would be enhanced by states and institutions adopting a broad strategy of accountability, starting with measures to enhance transparency through evidence-based research, monitoring of state compliance and evaluation of institutional performance. Over time these measures should be complemented by reforms that add heft to assessments of results. These reforms taken together require adequate and appropriate financing and ultimately will help ensure the provision of global public goods.Transcending current international political divisions&#8212;recovering from failed reforms and missed opportunities and overcoming mount-</span></div><div left="132.66" right="413.22" top="605.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="605.65" x1="413.22" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 135.68; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 3.02; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">stitutions&#8212;will not be an easy task, or one that can be accomplished quickly. Rather, it will take patient, sustained efforts over time. Moving forward in this direction requires action from all sectors: government and private, including civil society, and national, regional and international. The net result would be an international system more able to supply global public goods&#8212;an international system, in other words, less divided and more concerted in its action, more capable of joint, global action and less vulnerable to global ills.

Because this is so, it is also important that new efforts to provide global public goods are sensitive to their developmental impact. For example, efforts to improve the international financial stability regime must incorporate an understanding of the potential negative economic and social impact of financial stabilization and crisis response measures. Further trade liberalization must be accompanied both by efforts to build less-developed states&#8217; capacity to participate in trade negotiations and compensation mechanisms for those states adversely affected by broader agreements on tariff reduction and the like.

Martin Wolf (2004b) makes a similar point in his book when he says that &#8220;it is in the national interest of both states and their citizens to participate in international treaty-based regimes and institutions that deliver global public goods, including open markets, environmental protection, health and international security.&#8221; 20. See Mandelbaum (2005).21. Japan made a significant financial contribution to Interfet, as the Australian-led operation was known, and it is important to acknowl- edge also that the United States flexed its diplomatic and financial mus-cle to generate Indonesian acquiescence to the Australian and later the UN presence.22. Smaller states have also played such roles&#8212;as did, for example, Costa Rica in respect of biodiversity, setting aside nearly a third of its land mass as national parks and conservation areas and initiating public-private partnerships with bioprospecting industries to finance conservation, efforts which stood as examples and helped to shape the eventual conclusion of the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity. See Arce (2004). 23. See www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/.24. Some of the growing literature about global public goods refers to the &#8220;production path&#8221; for generating the supply of global public goods (see Kaul and others 2003). However, because the interaction between levels and actors involved in the supply of global public goods can occur in multiple different sequences, it is clarifying simply to set out the neces- sary factors whose presence is critical rather than attempting to over spec- ify the kinds of relationships between them that can generate supply.25. For example, some estimates show that when Thailand&#8217;s troubles with the bird flu became known, the resulting collapse in poultry ex-ports cost was well over $1 billion. </span><span x0="271.08" y0="171.65" x1="324.8" style="x0: 271.08; x1: 277.64; y0: 171.65; y1: 181.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">The Economist</span><span x0="324.8" y0="171.65" x1="393.76" style="x0: 324.8; x1: 327.4; y0: 171.65; y1: 181.65; width: 2.6; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">, 12 August 2006. 26.

While difficult to quantify, attempts at costing financial crises point to the magnitudes; a study by Steffany Griffith-Jones and Ricardo Gottschalk, Institute of Development Studies (2004), estimates that the emerging market countries suffered an output loss during the 1995&#8211; 2002 period of $1,250 billion, mainly as a direct result of major cur- rency crises. That is equal to an annual average of around $150 billion.Another study&#8212;see Dobson and Hufbauer (2001)&#8212;estimates that the average annual output loss from currency and banking crises amounted to 2.2% in Latin America in the 1980s and 1.4% in Asia in the 1990s.63.

Established under a 1953 treaty, CERN was a way to achieve high-energy physics on a scale that no country could achieve individually. The CERN has been constructing and operating particle accelerators since 1954 and is currently building a large hadron collider (LHC). The par-ticle collider must be built to a precise specification, and its construction requires a particular level of expenditure. If a little less is spent on the project, the specification will not be met, and the desired experiments cannot be carried out.

See Maskus (2006).93. However, against a general backdrop of disappointment, one small but important step forward for developing countries was the 2001 WTO Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, which emphasized that the TRIPS Agreement should be applied in a manner supportive of the right of states to protect the public health and promote access to medicines for all of their people; reaffirmed the rights of states to issue compul- sory licenses; and extended to 2016 the requirement that least devel-oped countries comply with the TRIPS Agreement (e.g., provide patent protection) in the pharmaceutical sector. A small but important further step forward followed in 2003 and 2005 with the WTO agreement to expand the possibilities for pharmaceutical producing countries to per-mit exports of medicines under a compulsory license to address public health problems in countries without adequate domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity. Many countries are, however, adopting domestic patent legisla- tion or entering into bilateral and regional trade agreements that con-tain more extensive protections than required under the global WTO TRIPS Agreement. These more extensive protections can have the ef-fect of undermining the TRIPS provisions that allow states to protect public health and may inhibit the capacity of countries to ensure access to affordable medicines. There is a need to ensure that bilateral and re-gional trade agreements do not restrict access to affordable medicines in low and middle income countries, and that countries do not give away their rights to protect public health in exchange for perceived opportu-nities in agricultural, apparel or other commercial markets. See Barton (2006) and Barrett (2007). 94. See Finger (2002).95. This has been proposed by Barton and Maskus, consultants to the Task Force Secretariat. See Barton and Maskus (2006). Whether the proposed agreement should be part of the WTO as Barton and Maskus suggest is a matter that should be further analysed.96.

In 1946 the threat of veto blocked the UN from responding to the outbreak of the first Arab-Israeli war, dampening the enthusiasm and optimism with which the organization was born. Again in 1967 the threat of veto blocked Security Council action in the Suez, further erod-ing support for the organization. More recently, nothing has damaged the UN so much as its unwillingness to respond to genocide in Rwanda (where the United States and other Permanent 5 members withheld support for a robust response), its non-action in Kosovo (where a veto was threatened by Russia) and the glacial pace of its response to Darfur (where the veto was implicitly threatened by China). These are all cases where a veto or a threat of a veto has made more forceful and timely ac- tion impossible. To make matters worse, where the veto has been threat-ened or wielded, other actors&#8212;regional institutions or coalitions of the willing&#8212;have acted anyway, notably in Kosovo and Iraq. International opinion largely supported NATO action in Kosovo and has largely op-posed US action in Iraq. But both events demonstrate that the veto serves to block collective action but not to forestall the non-authorized use of force, raising questions about its value and credibility as a feature of the Security Council. 109.

At the independent research level, there is a different prob-lem&#8212;geographical concentration. This differs from sector to sector. In the public health area, scientific expertise is geographically diffuse. This helps when it comes to developing national policy and support for recommendations; it may be a parochial reality, but it is a reality that national constituencies are likely to be more swayed by research that has a national or at least a regional component to its production. In development and finance, scientific and research expertise is more concentrated, though important Asian, Latin American and increasing numbers of African centres are changing this. When it comes to peace and security, research expertise is overwhelmingly concentrated among northern countries, and particularly in US universities. 111. Specifically the Arab Republic of Libya, the Democratic Re-public of Korea and the Islamic Republic of Iran have all been found by the IAEA Board of Governors to be in non-compliance with IAEA reporting requirements. 112.

See Barrett (2006b). Pioneering research by William Nordhaus suggests that an &#8220;optimal&#8221; mitigation policy initiated in 2005 would yield a benefit equal to $283 billion in present value terms at a present value cost of $92 billion. The net benefit would thus be $192 billion in present value, and the benefit-cost ratio 3:1. Nordhaus&#8217; supporting calculations indicate that the marginal benefit of mitigation is just over $9 per ton car-bon, which would be the optimal carbon tax, and that the corresponding optimal reduction in carbon emissions would be roughly 5%. 127.

Thus complementary, international as well as regional cooperation is required in order to produce locally desired de-velopment outcomes. Recognizing these interdependencies, Sweden and France have taken the initiative to establish an international task force with a mandate to foster an enhanced provision of international public goods, global and regional, which are of critical importance for eliminating pov- erty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In an in-terdependent world, extreme poverty and its manifold consequences are of concern to all; and it is thus in the enlightened self-interest of all to ensure a life in dignity for all. It is in our common interest to secure sustainable development in all its dimensions&#8212;environmental, social and economic.</span></div><div left="57.1" right="115.26" top="297.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="297.8" x1="115.26" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.14; y0: 297.8; y1: 307.8; width: 7.04; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Background</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.72" top="269.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="269.65" x1="337.72" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 67.1; y0: 269.65; y1: 279.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">While the notion of international public goods is gaining widespread recognition in the international development debates, the concept is met with circumspection and reservation, calling for further clarifica- tion and discussions. The notion refers to issues of global concern&#8212;common concerns of all&#8212;and voices have been raised suggesting the initiation of a participatory process in order to gain a better understand- ing of the analytical as well as practical-political relevance of the con-cept and how it can be translated into concrete policy actions. It is in this light that a temporary International Task Force (ITF), which would work in a highly consultative manner, has been established.</span></div><div left="57.1" right="102.29" top="101.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="101.8" x1="102.29" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.88; y0: 101.8; y1: 111.8; width: 7.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Objective</span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="73.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="73.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 73.65; y1: 83.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The ITF shall conduct its analyses and make its recommendations, act-</span></div><div left="57.1" right="251.5" top="539.87"><span x0="57.1" y0="539.87" x1="251.5" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 69.32; y0: 539.87; y1: 559.87; width: 12.22; font-size: 20.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Terms of Reference</span><span x0="355.27" y0="526.16" x1="385.29" style="x0: 355.27; x1: 385.29; y0: 526.16; y1: 580.16; width: 30.02; font-size: 54.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">1</span></div><div left="147.79" right="413.39" top="605.65"><span x0="147.79" y0="605.65" x1="413.39" style="x0: 147.79; x1: 154.56; y0: 605.65; y1: 615.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The ITF should systematically assess and clarify the notion of global and regional public goods and which public goods to accord policy and expenditure priority.
