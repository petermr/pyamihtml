This weakens the prospects for cooperation by add-ing a high degree of uncertainty to most international agreements. This basic problem underlies all the others.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="521.65" x1="217.7" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 80.12; y0: 521.65; y1: 531.65; width: 8.02; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Differing preferences and priorities. </span><span x0="219.16" y0="521.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 219.16; x1: 226.56; y0: 521.65; y1: 531.65; width: 7.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Governments often have di-vergent short-term interests in specific solutions even where they share common long-term goals; moreover, even the long-term goals themselves may resonate differently for different governments. Climate change, for example, impacts differently on different countries, and in the short-term some may even profit from changes to the local climate. Thus the &#8220;good&#8221; in global public goods is often contested. What might be a highly desirable public good for one country or group of people might not be so for another.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="395.65" x1="180.01" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 79.08; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 6.98; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">The &#8220;free rider&#8221; problem. </span><span x0="181.64" y0="395.65" x1="337.72" style="x0: 181.64; x1: 189.87; y0: 395.65; y1: 405.65; width: 8.23; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Once a public good is produced and made available to one, in principle it becomes available to all and it is hard to exclude others from its consumption. Consequently there is an incentive for every party to wait until another provides that public good, then enjoy its consumption. </span><span x0="72.1" y0="325.65" x1="187.51" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 79.08; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 6.98; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">The &#8220;weakest link&#8221; problem. </span><span x0="187.07" y0="325.65" x1="337.69" style="x0: 187.07; x1: 191.97; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Some global public goods can only be produced when every government fully complies with a common ap-proach&#8212;such as in efforts to eradicate an infectious disease. Success can be eroded by a single act of non-compliance. This makes for arduous long-term problems of cooperation. And the risk of failure is such that it is hard to convince governments to make the necessary investments. </span><span x0="72.1" y0="241.65" x1="184.59" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 79.08; y0: 241.65; y1: 251.65; width: 6.98; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">The &#8220;summation&#8221; problem. </span><span x0="184.9" y0="241.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 184.9; x1: 191.67; y0: 241.65; y1: 251.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">This occurs where the successful pro-duction of a particular global public good is literally the result or sum of the individual efforts of all the separate participants&#8212;such as mitigating global climate change. There are hard challenges in ensuring compli-ance and sustaining momentum with long-term global initiatives. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="184.53" top="143.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="143.8" x1="184.53" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.77; y0: 143.8; y1: 153.8; width: 6.67; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Purpose of the Task Force </span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.72" top="115.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="115.65" x1="337.72" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 64.5; y0: 115.65; y1: 125.65; width: 7.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Global public goods are not abstract concepts; they are instruments to address real-world problems. When they are not provided in adequate measure, global ills spread. It is as much avoiding these ills as providing the good itself that generates states&#8217; interest.
