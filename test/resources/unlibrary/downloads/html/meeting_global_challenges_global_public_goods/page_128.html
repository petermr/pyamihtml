But the relationship sometimes also goes in the other direction; for instance, the financing of international peace building and enforce-ment, which is not considered development assistance, contributes to the reduction of poverty. There are, however, major gaps in financing arrangements. Most donor countries, for example, have few funding sources to pay for global public goods activities in less developed countries except for where they can be considered to fall within official development assistance (ODA). Moreover, since many donor countries are focusing on poverty reduc-tion in the poorest countries and therefore significantly narrowing the list of countries to which ODA is allocated, there are even fewer tools for paying for global public goods activities in the far wider set of coun-tries that will need to be involved. Two examples illustrate this, drawing from our priorities: paying for counter-terrorism capacity building in countries that are not among the least developed, and funding for capital account crisis programmes, such as those in East Asia in the late 1990s. Neither is typically counted as ODA, reasonably; but because of this, both tend to go underfinanced. Going forward the international community will have to ensure that funding the provisions of global public goods is made on their own merits, that the development purposes of ODA are not eroded and that additional funds are mobilized. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="136.71" top="283.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="283.65" x1="136.71" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.66; y0: 283.65; y1: 293.65; width: 6.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Benefits to financing</span></div><div left="57.1" right="334.93" top="255.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="255.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 62.41; y0: 255.65; y1: 265.65; width: 5.31; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Financing global public goods can generate important returns, nation-ally and globally, economic and social. Whereas at the national level, finance ministries and legislators have become accustomed to assessing public expenditure in terms of cost-benefit analysis, such thinking is still largely in its infancy in the sphere of international cooperation. This has the disadvantage of largely con-fining international expenditure to the realm of the &#8220;voluntary&#8221; or &#8220;aid&#8221; sectors, for which there are limited constituencies in some national con-texts. (With important exceptions&#8212;witness the extraordinary response, both official and unofficial, to humanitarian needs in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean Tsunami.) This is misguided thinking when it comes to global public goods; putting money towards these particular chal-lenges can yield major returns.
