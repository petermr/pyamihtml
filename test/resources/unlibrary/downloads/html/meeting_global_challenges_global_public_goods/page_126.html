Similarly, national governments bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that fi-nancing needs for global public goods are met through direct public funding and appropriate incentives and regulatory frameworks that stimulate private funding and the use of market mechanisms. Nations will gain major benefits by increasing their expenditure on global public goods. Initial cost-benefit analyses of various global public goods confirm that money spent on providing them can produce sig-nificant savings compared to the cost of dealing with the ills that arise when such goods are not provided, including financial shocks, spread of new diseases, nuclear proliferation crises and so on. Indeed past experi-ence demonstrates very high benefit-cost ratios for global public goods. This suggests that significant additional expenditures on global public goods are well justified. And with greater provision of global public goods, investments in development will also reap greater returns.Governments can also do more to tap the energy and initiative of the private sector, including civil society, and to take advantage of the specialized knowledge they can bring to bear. Examples include recent developments in emission permit trading and advance mar- ket commitments for new vaccines. We can foresee market-based ap-proaches being expanded to address other global issues, in particular in the areas of health, environmental services and knowledge. Such extensions do, however, require the involvement of governments to provide the necessary regulatory framework. Even then, however, for governments to convince sceptical publics of the value of investing in global public goods they will have to insti-tute reforms to make better use of resources. In short, we recommend in this chapter a five-part strategy for the </span></div><div left="57.1" right="200.76" top="587.87"><span x0="57.1" y0="587.87" x1="200.76" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 70.8; y0: 587.87; y1: 607.87; width: 13.7; font-size: 20.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Adequate and Appropriate Financing: Why?
