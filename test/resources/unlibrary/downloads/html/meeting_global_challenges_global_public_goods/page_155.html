At the independent research level, there is a different prob-lem&#8212;geographical concentration. This differs from sector to sector.

In development and finance, scientific and research expertise is more concentrated, though important Asian, Latin American and increasing numbers of African centres are changing this. When it comes to peace and security, research expertise is overwhelmingly concentrated among northern countries, and particularly in US universities. 111.
