See Maskus (2006).93. However, against a general backdrop of disappointment, one small but important step forward for developing countries was the 2001 WTO Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, which emphasized that the TRIPS Agreement should be applied in a manner supportive of the right of states to protect the public health and promote access to medicines for all of their people; reaffirmed the rights of states to issue compul- sory licenses; and extended to 2016 the requirement that least devel-oped countries comply with the TRIPS Agreement (e.g., provide patent protection) in the pharmaceutical sector. A small but important further step forward followed in 2003 and 2005 with the WTO agreement to expand the possibilities for pharmaceutical producing countries to per-mit exports of medicines under a compulsory license to address public health problems in countries without adequate domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity. Many countries are, however, adopting domestic patent legisla- tion or entering into bilateral and regional trade agreements that con-tain more extensive protections than required under the global WTO TRIPS Agreement. These more extensive protections can have the ef-fect of undermining the TRIPS provisions that allow states to protect public health and may inhibit the capacity of countries to ensure access to affordable medicines. There is a need to ensure that bilateral and re-gional trade agreements do not restrict access to affordable medicines in low and middle income countries, and that countries do not give away their rights to protect public health in exchange for perceived opportu-nities in agricultural, apparel or other commercial markets. See Barton (2006) and Barrett (2007). 94. See Finger (2002).95. This has been proposed by Barton and Maskus, consultants to the Task Force Secretariat. See Barton and Maskus (2006). Whether the proposed agreement should be part of the WTO as Barton and Maskus suggest is a matter that should be further analysed.96.
