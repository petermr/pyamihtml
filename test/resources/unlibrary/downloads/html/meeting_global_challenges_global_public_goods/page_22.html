This and other changes in the intellectual property system have resulted in a relative contraction of the common knowledge platform. The knowledge gap between the rich countries and the majority of poor countries is widening and with it the possibilities of closing the development gap between them. Furthermore, the role of knowledge as an input for the production of other global public goods is also being limited by the protection of intellectual property as clearly exemplified by the cases of R&amp;D for disease control and climate change. The Task Force strongly endorses two types of initiatives. First, those aimed to enhance the common knowledge platform through interna-tional partnerships. Specifically, donor countries should expand their financial commitments to enhance the global research and information capabilities necessary to overcome some crucial problems in the areas of rural development, environment and health in the poorest developing countries. It is essential to ensure additional funding for the institutions already conducting research in these areas, particularly the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research and the various partner-ships in the medical sectors. On health, serious consideration should be given to the creation of new partnerships, preferably a network of research facilities specializing in tropical diseases.Second, the Task Force endorses initiatives aimed to balance the effects of TRIPS on developing countries. Specifically we call for the establishment of a multilateral agreement for access to basic science and technology (ABST) to facilitate the transfer of scientific knowledge and technological information to developing countries. Through ABST, developed countries would be committed to support poor countries in enhancing their capacity to assimilate, diffuse and generate knowledge. With the necessary safeguards, ABST would adopt regimes to allow re-searchers from all countries to compete for local research grants and for increasing global access to research outcomes. These regimes should be built on the most-favoured-nation and national treatment principles.  </span></div><div left="57.1" right="277.96" top="115.8"><span x0="57.1" y0="115.8" x1="277.96" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 60.05; y0: 115.8; y1: 125.8; width: 2.95; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Improving the provision of global public goods</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.69" top="87.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="87.65" x1="337.69" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 67.1; y0: 87.65; y1: 97.65; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">We conclude, as others have before us, that the best hope for generating the kind of catalytic leadership necessary for the provision of global public </span></div></body></html>
