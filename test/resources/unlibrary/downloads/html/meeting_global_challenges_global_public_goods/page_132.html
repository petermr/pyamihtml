Traditionally international matters were the preserve of foreign ministries. As the global dimensions of national policy have been amplified in sector after sector, the ability of foreign ministries to serve as central coordinating mechanisms for foreign and global policy has lagged in all sectors of government. Individual ministers and government departments thus can and often do pursue national policies that have foreign or global effects that are contrary to foreign or global policies in other sectors of the same government&#8212;a suboptimal system at best. Some national governments are exploring ways to achieve coherence and broad ownership of their international policies.Examples include the policy coherence unit in the Netherlands, Sweden&#8217;s global development policy as decided by parliament and a whole of government approach in Australia&#8212;processes for integrating all policy areas in the work to achieve common goals in international engagements. As the regional and global dimensions of national policy grow in importance, further innovations to manage the national-regional-global relationship will be required. In Europe some have called for EU affairs ministries to coor- dinate the EU dimensions of national policy.</span><span x0="231.14" y0="343.96" x1="239.66" style="x0: 231.14; x1: 234.0; y0: 343.96; y1: 349.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">130</span></div><div left="72.1" right="334.93" top="325.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="325.65" x1="334.93" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.87; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Another question is how national finance systems account for spend- ing on foreign and global policy questions. In Canada, the Prime Min-ister&#8217;s Office initiated a two-track budgeting system designed to ensure that national ministries pay out of their own resource allocation for the international mechanisms they benefit from. More common is for na-tional ministries to look to ODA budgets to pay for policies that relate less to development and more to national sector policy initiatives. In the absence of separate systems for financing global policy and global public goods, using development funds is the only option for national ministries that do not have significant budgets for foreign expenditure&#8212;again, a suboptimal system at best.</span><span x0="72.1" y0="171.65" x1="173.42" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.25; y0: 171.65; y1: 181.65; width: 6.15; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Building national capacity. </span><span x0="175.05" y0="171.65" x1="337.74" style="x0: 175.05; x1: 181.4; y0: 171.65; y1: 181.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Because the provision of global public goods requires action by many states, not just developed ones, an addi-tional requirement is improving measures to build capacity. Across the spectrum of global challenges, participation in generating or implementing global agreements requires effective state institutions. Many states have severe capacity constrains preventing them from play- ing a full role in supplying global public goods.</span><span x0="238.54" y0="91.96" x1="247.11" style="x0: 238.54; x1: 241.4; y0: 91.96; y1: 97.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">131</span><span x0="248.1" y0="87.65" x1="337.72" style="x0: 248.1; x1: 254.87; y0: 87.65; y1: 97.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The past 20 years have witnessed commitments to reform and strengthen development strate-</span></div></body></html>
