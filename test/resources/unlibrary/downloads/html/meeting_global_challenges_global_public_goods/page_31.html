New infectious diseases, further changes to the climate, financial instability and a negative spiral of mounting tensions and rising protectionism together threaten to erode international peace and prosperity. Opportunities for collective achievement are lost primarily for two reasons. First, in a world of sovereign, independent states, significant barriers to cooperation remain (from the basic realities of sovereign independence, to the calculations that states make to avoid shouldering their fair share of costs), even when the goals are in the national interests of all. Second, the mechanisms for international cooperation in their current form are weak, or their legitimacy is eroded. The Task Force&#8217;s work was conceived at a time when several initia-tives were under way to bolster international cooperation&#8212;a time of opportunity. It was inspired by the knowledge that past cooperation had achieved impressive results in combating poverty and disease, in promoting security and in protecting the environment. Unfortunately we complete our work at a time when several initia-tives have disappointed&#8212;at a time of rising risk. We conclude our work against the backdrop of growing disquiet among people from all regions about the state of international politics and governance. At a time of concern about the international trading system, occasioned by protec- tionist actions by governments, rising anti-trade sentiment among popu-lations and the failure to complete the Doha trade round. At a time when weekly headlines about avian flu remind us of our vulnerability and sci-entific warnings prompt deep concern about our environment. And at a time of mounting, interlocking crises in the Middle East&#8212;crises that threaten not only that region but also the broader international order.In recent years, successive opportunities to revitalize&#8212;and where necessary, sharply reform&#8212;the structures of international cooperation have been squandered or at best have delivered only partial results. The litany of missed opportunities is impressive only in its length. Since the start of the decade, governments have: failed to bring into force the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty; failed to move forward the Biological Weapons Convention; failed to agree on the necessary actions to give force and meaning to the Kyoto Protocol; failed to avoid war in Iraq; failed to take more than half measures to reform the International Monetary Fund; failed to design a European constitution that could convince voters; failed to break the stalemate in the Doha Round of the </span></div></body></html>
