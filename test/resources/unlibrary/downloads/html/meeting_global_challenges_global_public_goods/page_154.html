In 1946 the threat of veto blocked the UN from responding to the outbreak of the first Arab-Israeli war, dampening the enthusiasm and optimism with which the organization was born. Again in 1967 the threat of veto blocked Security Council action in the Suez, further erod-ing support for the organization. More recently, nothing has damaged the UN so much as its unwillingness to respond to genocide in Rwanda (where the United States and other Permanent 5 members withheld support for a robust response), its non-action in Kosovo (where a veto was threatened by Russia) and the glacial pace of its response to Darfur (where the veto was implicitly threatened by China). These are all cases where a veto or a threat of a veto has made more forceful and timely ac- tion impossible. To make matters worse, where the veto has been threat-ened or wielded, other actors&#8212;regional institutions or coalitions of the willing&#8212;have acted anyway, notably in Kosovo and Iraq. International opinion largely supported NATO action in Kosovo and has largely op-posed US action in Iraq. But both events demonstrate that the veto serves to block collective action but not to forestall the non-authorized use of force, raising questions about its value and credibility as a feature of the Security Council. 109.
