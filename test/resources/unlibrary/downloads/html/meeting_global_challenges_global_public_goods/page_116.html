Global public goods must be perceived to be so, in values or interest terms, by a large majority of states involved in their production. Oth-erwise implementation will be near impossible. However, in a world of 200 states, we can not base our approach on the idea that all states will always meaningfully be able to share their preferences about the value of a given global public good. Even in the UN General Assembly, which comes closest to a forum for all states to express their interests and prefer-ences across a range of global issues, the reality is that regional groupings (slightly odd ones) and political groupings (out of date ones) actually take up most of the negotiating oxygen in the General Assembly&#8217;s chambers. Highly selective groupings&#8212;such as the G-8 and the UN Security Council&#8212;are able to reach agreement on priorities, but are less and less able to persuade non-members of the legitimacy of their decisions. This has been starkly shown in the Security Council, not only around spe-cific crises such as Iraq, but also in efforts to set mandatory international standards for non-proliferation and counter-terrorism. It is also seen in international political reactions to G-8 proposals, though the group has done somewhat more to begin to adapt, including more consultation with non-members. Moving forward, we believe that the international capacity to meet the growing demand and the urgent need for global public goods re-quires institutional reforms that increase the participation of a wider band of states willing to demonstrate responsibility and to sustain com-mitments. They must also reflect the political reality that unless our institutions are able to persuade and to legitimize, they will not be ef-fective. Governance reforms must also bring into the decision-making system states, especially among emerging powers, with a capacity to help legitimize decisions. The perceived legitimacy and production of priority global public goods would be enhanced if the IMF and the World Bank adopted governance reforms giving greater weight to under-represented na-tions and if the UN made reforms to the Security Council, ideally both to its membership and to its veto mechanism, and to the broader UN system as a whole. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="214.7" top="101.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="101.65" x1="214.7" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 60.85; y0: 101.65; y1: 111.65; width: 3.75; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">IMF and World Bank governance reform</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.7" top="73.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="73.65" x1="337.7" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 63.87; y0: 73.65; y1: 83.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The provision of global public goods would be improved by changes to </span></div></body></html>
