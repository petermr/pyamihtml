Examples include recent developments in emission permit trading and advance market commitments. We envisage market- based approaches being expanded to address other global issues, in particu-lar in the areas of health, environment and knowledge. Governments should provide the necessary regulatory frameworks and incentives. </span><span x0="147.79" y0="409.65" x1="324.35" style="x0: 147.79; x1: 154.98; y0: 409.65; y1: 419.65; width: 7.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Adopt innovative arrangements for financing. </span><span x0="324.06" y0="409.65" x1="413.39" style="x0: 324.06; x1: 327.39; y0: 409.65; y1: 419.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">In addition to broader partnership with the private sector, governments should make greater use of innovative sources of financing. Among the various proposals for innovative financing arrangements at the international level, we see most merit in, and endorse, the airline ticket solidarity contribution and the International Finance Facility. We also urge governments to con-sider adoption of carbon taxes. Taken together these reforms would help ensure adequate and ap-propriate financing of critically importantglobal public goods. And again, the Global 25 would help initiate and monitor these reforms.</span></div><div left="132.79" right="186.48" top="241.8"><span x0="132.79" y0="241.8" x1="186.48" style="x0: 132.79; x1: 140.2; y0: 241.8; y1: 251.8; width: 7.41; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HPGRMI+HelveticaNeue-Bold;">Conclusion</span></div><div left="132.79" right="410.62" top="213.65"><span x0="132.79" y0="213.65" x1="410.62" style="x0: 132.79; x1: 139.56; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Transcending current international political divisions, the litany of failed re- forms or missed opportunities and mounting dissatisfaction with the gover-nance of the major international institutions will not be an easy task, or one that can be accomplished quickly. It will take sustained efforts over time. Moving forward in this direction requires action from all sectors&#8212;government, private and civic; and national, regional and international. The net result would be an international system more able to supply global public goods&#8212;in other words, a system less divided and more concerted in its action, more capable of joint, global action and less vul- nerable to global ills. It would be a good, surely, to be desired by all.</span></div></body></html>
