Second, sovereign debtors and their private creditors have agreed on a set of principles for stable capital flows and fair debt restructuring in emerging markets.</span><span x0="205.63" y0="539.96" x1="211.35" style="x0: 205.63; x1: 208.49; y0: 539.96; y1: 545.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">73</span><span x0="212.74" y0="535.65" x1="413.28" style="x0: 212.74; x1: 219.51; y0: 535.65; y1: 545.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">This effort should be pursued further by sovereign debtors and their private creditors. These principles could facilitate dia-logue between creditors and debtors (critical to the debt restructuring process), promote corrective policy action to reduce the frequency and severity of crises and improve the prospects for an orderly and expedi-tious resolution of crises. A third mechanism is some insurance-type instrument that would allow countries with strong policies beset by a financial crisis to draw from the IMF and line up significant international financial support very quickly, along the lines of the IMF&#8217;s Contingent Credit Line, which expired in 2004. It has been proposed that the Fund or the World Bank establish a new medium-term stability and growth facility for supporting emerging-market economies that would be sufficiently large, front-loaded and long-lived to facilitate the reduction of large debt burdens while encouraging social policies designed to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</span><span x0="297.72" y0="329.96" x1="303.43" style="x0: 297.72; x1: 300.57; y0: 329.96; y1: 335.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">74</span><span x0="304.4" y0="325.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 304.4; x1: 311.17; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The Fund is currently con-sidering a new instrument that provides a high-access line of credit to emerging markets that have strong macroeconomic policies but which remain vulnerable to shocks.The IMF should consider to a greater extent the impacts of policy options on the most vulnerable sections of society, both in its surveil- lance work (as suggested by the IMF Independent Evaluation Office)</span><span x0="404.78" y0="245.96" x1="410.5" style="x0: 404.78; x1: 407.64; y0: 245.96; y1: 251.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">75</span></div><div left="132.66" right="335.33" top="227.65"><span x0="132.66" y0="227.65" x1="335.33" style="x0: 132.66; x1: 136.62; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 3.96; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">and in designing capital account crisis programmes.</span><span x0="147.66" y0="213.65" x1="255.68" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.95; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 7.29; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-Italic;">Combating money laundering. </span><span x0="255.07" y0="213.65" x1="413.15" style="x0: 255.07; x1: 264.24; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 9.17; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Markedly less visible than financial crises is the often inadvertent assistance provided to criminal elements for the cross-border financing of illegal and terrorist activities.
