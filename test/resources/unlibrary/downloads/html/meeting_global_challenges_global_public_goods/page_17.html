Alongside these measures, the IMF must pay more attention to the impacts of policy options on the most vulnerable sections of society, both in its surveillance work and in crisis management. </span><span x0="147.79" y0="464.72" x1="157.41" style="x0: 147.79; x1: 152.74; y0: 464.72; y1: 478.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.79" y0="465.65" x1="413.45" style="x0: 168.79; x1: 176.08; y0: 465.65; y1: 475.65; width: 7.29; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Combating money laundering&#8212;The inadvertent assistance provided to criminal elements for the cross-border financ-ing of illegal and terrorist activities is an important, negative side-effect of the global financial system. An effective response would involve the adoption of global standards on asset freezes and forfeitures and further efforts within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to in- clude tax evasion at home or abroad among the offences sub-ject to prosecution. The IMF should also produce a periodic global report on money laundering. </span><span x0="147.79" y0="324.72" x1="157.34" style="x0: 147.79; x1: 152.74; y0: 324.72; y1: 338.72; width: 4.96; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: DJSTIQ+Bembo-Bold;">&#8226; </span><span x0="168.79" y0="325.65" x1="413.17" style="x0: 168.79; x1: 173.69; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Strengthening the IMF&#8212;Any strategy for financial stability must ensure a strong and effective IMF. There are risks to the financial system, including the current account imbalances that loom over the international economy, the risks associated with undersupervision of derivatives and the intervention of large-scale hedge funds into the international capital market. We see the current moment of relative calm as a time for preparedness not complacency&#8212;an important opportunity to take the nec-essary policy, governance and financial steps to ensure the IMF is well prepared to take on future crises. </span><span x0="147.79" y0="185.65" x1="341.36" style="x0: 147.79; x1: 153.0; y0: 185.65; y1: 195.65; width: 5.21; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Strengthening the international trading system. </span><span x0="342.66" y0="185.65" x1="410.62" style="x0: 342.66; x1: 347.56; y0: 185.65; y1: 195.65; width: 4.9; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Since the incep-tion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, a process to build a rule-based multilateral trading system has been tak-ing place. This system has supported the progressive liberalization of international trade, which, in turn, has been a chief engine of global economic growth for well over half a century. Despite its remarkable evolution, the multilateral trading system is not quite as global, as public or as good as potentially it can be.
