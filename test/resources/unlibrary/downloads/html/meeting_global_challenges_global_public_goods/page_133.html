For example, multilateral cooperation may un-dermine the capacity of national systems. Vertical or issue-specific programmes can have positive impacts on developing country capaci- ties, but they can also impose a heavy toll on human resource and in-stitutional development. Global issue-specific programmes in health have often undercut existing capacities by failing to build sustainable health systems, fragmenting health services and distorting the alloca-tion of scarce human and financial resources. Because global issue-specific programmes usually cannot be sustained without the support of local systems, most developing countries need help in building their general administrative systems and programmes. In truth the international aid community knows much less than it needs to about how external aid works to build national capacity. However recent studies have demonstrated that the World Bank, with its expe-rience and resources for running capacity-building programmes, has the potential to do more to develop local capacities and facilitate the absorption of global vertical programmes.</span><span x0="299.84" y0="329.96" x1="308.34" style="x0: 299.84; x1: 302.7; y0: 329.96; y1: 335.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">134</span><span x0="311.12" y0="325.65" x1="410.5" style="x0: 311.12; x1: 317.89; y0: 325.65; y1: 335.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The UN&#8217;s role in devel-oping state capacity is under study by the High-Level Panel on UN  System-wide Coherence. Bilateral support is also relevant and would profit from the participation of a wider group of countries, including emerg-ing donors who have more recent experience than OECD countries in building national administrative systems in a development context. There is little doubt that donors should increase and sustain resources to strengthen the capacities of developing countries in the global interest. Increasing the harmonisation and coherence of donor programmes is the first logical action.

The declaration asserts that capacity develop-ment is the responsibility of partner countries and that donors should play a supportive role. It highlights that support for capacity development should not only be based on technical aspects, but also should consider the broader social, political and economic environment as well as the need to strengthen human resources. The agenda is set for doing better, but more remains to be done to translate declarations into actions. In practice this requires knowing who does what and where and how </span></div></body></html>
