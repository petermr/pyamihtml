Aligning preferences and setting priorities in a world of 200 states is an acute challenge. In some contexts regional mechanisms are effectively used to agree on common preferences and priorities for inputs to international de-cision-making&#8212;for example, in some of the regional and sub-regional groupings that share board seats at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. In other contexts regional groupings in international mechanisms are out of alignment with regional organi-zations&#8212;as, for example, with the African regional grouping at the UN, which has different presidencies (and often substantially different priorities) from the African Union (AU). The value of a regional approach differs from area to area. Asian re-gionalism is fragmented&#8212;hardly surprising given the size of the region and the vast differences in the types of states that it comprises. The result is that most Asian regional bodies are issue-specific and in all likelihood will remain so in the foreseeable future. Greater Asian representation and voice in international institutions is not likely to occur through a regional approach, but through the inclusion of major Asian powers in the governance mechanisms of those institutions. Latin American coun-tries have long pursued regional integration, but their efforts have only begun to tackle the most difficult challenges that confront the region, including social inequality, organized crime and the regional fallout from internal conflict.</span><span x0="219.79" y0="245.96" x1="228.36" style="x0: 219.79; x1: 222.65; y0: 245.96; y1: 251.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">103</span></div><div left="147.66" right="413.41" top="227.65"><span x0="147.66" y0="227.65" x1="413.41" style="x0: 147.66; x1: 154.43; y0: 227.65; y1: 237.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">That said, even within the weaker regional frameworks, there are important examples worth building on. The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has played directly and through its hosting of the ASEAN Regional Forum useful roles in mediating regional conflict (for example in Cambodia) and in calming regional tensions (in the South China Seas). A stronger role for regional institutions is particularly salient in Af-rica. Although countries on the African continent vary as widely in cultural and political terms as do the members of Asian groupings, there is a narrower band of difference in state capacity. The New Economic Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) and reform of the  AU have already strengthened African voices in international fora. Fur-</span></div></body></html>
