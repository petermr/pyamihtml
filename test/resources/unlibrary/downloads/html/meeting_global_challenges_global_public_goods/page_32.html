The full effect of these missed opportunities may not be felt immedi-ately. Modern history tells us that states allow their systems for cooperation to erode gradually, missing positive opportunities and slowly increasing the odds of a negative spiral of economic reversal and conflict. Nor can we ignore the possibility of worse scenarios. There are alarming warnings about the pace of climate change. The lurch from crisis to crisis in nuclear proliferation brings with it a growing risk of the spread and use of nuclear weapons, especially by terrorist organi-zations. In some regions states appear to be teetering on the edge of internal collapse under the combined weight of poor governance, weak institutions, the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and the regional spillovers from conflict. Health officials warn of the lack of adequate preparation for pandemic disease. And growing imbalances in the international financial system loom over the global economy. The risks of the moment are amplified by the pace of contemporary technological change. Not since the early 1900s has the international system experienced such a rapid rise in the rate of change in commer-cial and communication technology. Then as now, the bedrock system of economic interdependence seems invulnerable. The British thinker Normal Angell observed that &#8220;it is an economic impossibility for one nation to seize or destroy the wealth of another, or for one nation to enrich itself by subjugating another.&#8221;</span><span x0="202.69" y0="287.96" x1="205.55" style="x0: 202.69; x1: 205.55; y0: 287.96; y1: 293.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">2</span><span x0="208.48" y0="283.65" x1="337.73" style="x0: 208.48; x1: 214.83; y0: 283.65; y1: 293.65; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">But Angell was writing in 1910. The First World War demonstrated that interconnectedness can increase the risks of global violence. And at the end of that war, the weary armies were key vectors in the spread of an influenza epidemic that claimed more deaths than the fighting.</span><span x0="176.6" y0="231.96" x1="179.45" style="x0: 176.6; x1: 179.45; y0: 231.96; y1: 237.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">3</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.57" top="213.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="213.65" x1="337.57" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.87; y0: 213.65; y1: 223.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">Then as now interdependence increases both opportunities and risks. There are unparalleled opportunities to apply modern scientific knowledge and resources to fight disease and protect the environment. Modern technology, much of it developed by the private sector, creates unprecedented access to information by entrepreneurs, civil society and populations as a whole. But the risks are more dire for the sheer de-structive capacity of modern weapons technology, and for the increasing access to that technology. Scientific advance and the ability to rapidly share knowledge have created enormous promise in the ability to solve global problems, but also enormous peril in that these same advances have democratized the power to destroy. </span></div></body></html>
