Debate in the UN in the follow-up to the Secretary-General&#8217;s sub-mission of these principles to the General Assembly and the Security Council revealed significant support for their acceptance, but a division among the permanent members about the desirability of their adop-tion as formal guidelines. In this, as in other matters, enhancing the legitimacy of the Security Council can only contribute to the process of aligning national and global interests. The alternatives are a Security Council unable to act, or one able to act only against the broad sense of members&#8217; values and interests&#8212;equally unpalatable outcomes. But enhancing the legitimacy of the Security Council will require more than just articulating criteria for the use of force. Rather, the mechanism that has repeatedly blocked action in critical cases&#8212;the veto&#8212;requires attention, if only to try to reach consensus about the limited circumstances in which it should be used. So too does the mem- bership of the body, now as outdated and unrepresentative as to struc-turally weaken its legitimacy and perceived authority. Reforms to the veto and composition of the Security Council would significantly en-hance its authority to act and the capacity to succeed. We address the details in chapter 9. </span></div></body></html>
