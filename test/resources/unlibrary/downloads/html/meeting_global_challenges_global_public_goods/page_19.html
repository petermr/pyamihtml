The Quad would not need to grant unilaterally an offer of agricul-tural reform and aid for trade; the Quad could make it conditional upon satisfactory completion of the other key issues included in the Doha Development Agenda. An agreement of this kind among the Quad members most likely would have a powerful catalytic effect on the rest of the WTO membership. Other developed countries resistant until now to remove agricultural barriers would have to reconsider their po-sitions. Large developing countries, that have had in rich countries&#8217; farm protectionism a good reason (or the perfect excuse) for not moving in the negotiations, would also find compromise towards a good agree-ment to be inescapable. Finally, a solvent aid for trade fund would help in bringing other developing countries on board.But the WTO trade negotiators&#8217; capacities can never exceed the mandate received from the governments they represent. It will be up to the highest levels of political leadership to do what it takes to complete the Doha agenda.</span><span x0="147.79" y0="129.65" x1="264.7" style="x0: 147.79; x1: 154.98; y0: 129.65; y1: 139.65; width: 7.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Achieving peace and security. </span><span x0="264.91" y0="129.65" x1="410.62" style="x0: 264.91; x1: 268.24; y0: 129.65; y1: 139.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">In the absence of an effective collec-tive security system, not only will the levels of war, terrorism and other forms of strife increase, but international prosperity will be at risk or even reversed.
