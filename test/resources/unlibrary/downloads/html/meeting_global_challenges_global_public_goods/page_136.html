Increased accountability of international institutions is critical as discussed in the previous chapter&#8212;so are increased international ef-forts to combat corruption and money laundering. Such improvements would enhance the credibility of multilateral cooperation and, hence, improve the prospects for additional funding for global public goods. </span></div><div left="57.1" right="174.16" top="437.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="437.65" x1="174.16" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 60.85; y0: 437.65; y1: 447.65; width: 3.75; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: ERCZWO+Bembo-BoldItalic;">Improve resource mobilization</span></div><div left="57.1" right="337.7" top="409.65"><span x0="57.1" y0="409.65" x1="337.7" style="x0: 57.1; x1: 60.43; y0: 409.65; y1: 419.65; width: 3.33; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">International organizations that provide global public goods are most effective with predictable and sustained financing. To be successful, funding cycles should allow sufficient time to demonstrate results and for the organization to be held accountable. This is challenging with annual funding cycles. Furthermore annual funding does not pro-vide institutions with the predictability of financing that is required for effective programme management. A three-year cycle for major funding&#8212;through so-called replenishment processes&#8212;has proven a successful model.</span><span x0="125.74" y0="301.96" x1="134.37" style="x0: 125.74; x1: 128.6; y0: 301.96; y1: 307.79; width: 2.86; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">140</span></div><div left="72.1" right="337.83" top="283.65"><span x0="72.1" y0="283.65" x1="337.83" style="x0: 72.1; x1: 78.87; y0: 283.65; y1: 293.65; width: 6.77; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: FZMFKM+Bembo;">The governing boards of those organizations&#8212;mostly UN funds and programmes&#8212;which currently have annual, or ad hoc, funding cycles should explore new funding models that would allow them to demonstrate results and to be held accountable for their actions, draw- ing on established best-practice formulas. For replenishments to be successful, there should be broad participa-tion, and the financial burden should be fairly shared. How can this be achieved? First, by benchmarking contributions to benefits and ability/capacity to pay. Negotiated burden-sharing arrangements should be made as explicit as possible. Explicit shares provide a benchmark against which performance can be judged. A country&#8217;s failure to contribute a previously pledged amount provides an effective lever for the international commu-nity to encourage its fulfilment. Second, we can make use of benefit estimates to guide negotiations on burden sharing. To justify a country&#8217;s contribution, a government must be able to demonstrate that it is paying the country&#8217;s fair share. </span></div></body></html>
