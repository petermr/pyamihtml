The estimates take a One Health approach when considering surveillance requirements for research, data collection and processing or, in the case of the McKinsey costing, some cost of biosecurity in farms and of wildlife and wild meat trade. However, it would have been difficult to provide comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the wider approach for this report, thus estimates for a full One Health approach are not included in our calculations</span><span x0="506.74" y0="700.34" x1="513.18" style="x0: 506.74; x1: 509.98; y0: 700.34; y1: 706.17; width: 3.24; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">70</span><span x0="513.26" y0="695.96" x1="518.82" style="x0: 513.26; x1: 516.04; y0: 695.96; y1: 705.96; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">. </span></div><div left="72.28" right="80.26" top="669.66"><span x0="72.28" y0="669.66" x1="80.26" style="x0: 72.28; x1: 77.28; y0: 669.66; y1: 679.66; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0.549, 0.815]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">&#8226; Thirdly, the estimates presented in this report include R&amp;D investment, specifically research linked to new pathogens, as part of surveillance and research into vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. However, basic research is excluded from these estimates. Basic research has been defined as scientific investigation that involves the generation of new knowledge or development of new theories. That is, research with results that often cannot be applied directly to specific clinical situations and therefore will only be indirectly beneficial to pandemic prevention and preparedness. Pre-clinical and basic research can nonetheless have a significant impact on pandemic prevention and preparedness</span><span x0="531.91" y0="596.04" x1="538.39" style="x0: 531.91; x1: 535.16; y0: 596.04; y1: 601.87; width: 3.24; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">71</span><span x0="538.35" y0="591.66" x1="543.91" style="x0: 538.35; x1: 541.13; y0: 591.66; y1: 601.66; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">. </span></div><div left="72.29" right="80.27" top="565.36"><span x0="72.29" y0="565.36" x1="80.27" style="x0: 72.29; x1: 77.29; y0: 565.36; y1: 575.36; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0.549, 0.815]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">&#8226; Fourthly, in the category of medical countermeasures, our estimates for the cost of manufacturing are very conservative. The dedicated stream of work from the AHT group for the Panel indicates that investing in US$60 billion upfront to expand production capacity for vaccines and supply chain inputs (US$2.2 billion per year thereafter to maintain capacity) would provide far greater benefits</span><span x0="513.86" y0="530.74" x1="520.44" style="x0: 513.86; x1: 517.1; y0: 530.74; y1: 536.57; width: 3.24; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">72</span><span x0="520.66" y0="526.36" x1="526.22" style="x0: 520.66; x1: 523.44; y0: 526.36; y1: 536.36; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">. </span></div><div left="72.29" right="80.27" top="500.06"><span x0="72.29" y0="500.06" x1="80.27" style="x0: 72.29; x1: 77.29; y0: 500.06; y1: 510.06; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0.549, 0.815]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">&#8226; Finally, outbreaks occur more frequently in countries that have overall weak health systems and building resilience in health systems to best prepare them against pandemics requires, as a prerequisite, a much broader strengthening in many low- and middle-income countries. The cost of such measures has also been excluded from the main estimates of the report as being only indirectly related to the global public good approach on which the report focuses. The WHO estimates the health system financing needs towards the objective of universal health coverage at US$555 billion over five years.
