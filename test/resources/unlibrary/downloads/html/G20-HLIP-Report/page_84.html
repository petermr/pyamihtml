Most needs are at the national level, where ongoing data collection, integration, analysis and dissemination systems will need to be put in place. Diligent detection of infections requires a distributed infrastructure of laboratory facilities. National public health institutes play a key role in providing robust surveillance systems at national, sub-national, and local levels. At the global level, WHO with its six regional offices is the anchor to coordinate and organize global surveillance; the system also relies on key regional centres, like the Africa CDC. These different structures all need some strengthening going forward. Our cost estimates have also taken into account the need to implement the One Health approach for the monitoring and detection of zoonotic spillovers. </span></div><div left="34.01" right="41.79" top="465.25"><span x0="34.01" y0="465.25" x1="41.79" style="x0: 34.01; x1: 39.01; y0: 465.25; y1: 475.25; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0.549, 0.815]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">&#8226; </span><span x0="55.27" y0="465.25" x1="239.16" style="x0: 55.27; x1: 61.75; y0: 465.25; y1: 475.25; width: 6.48; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Black;">Building resilience in health systems. </span><span x0="240.09" y0="465.25" x1="547.04" style="x0: 240.09; x1: 245.83; y0: 465.25; y1: 475.25; width: 5.74; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">This encompasses the GPMB&#8217;s categories of immunisation; health system capacity and access; pandemic planning and exercising; norms, standards, evidence-based policy, technical support; and community engagement and trust.
