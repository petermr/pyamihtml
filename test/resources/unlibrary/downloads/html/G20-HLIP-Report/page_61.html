The G20 sponsored Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) made a significant contribution from bilateral official creditors to helping (mostly) low-income countries during this pandemic. However, delays in reaching agreement on its scope and application slowed down the flow of relief and limited its impact because of the non-participation of some hybrid and most private creditors. Learning from this experience, the G20 should ask the IMF, working with the relevant stakeholders, to propose a framework to involve the participation of all creditors &#8212; official, hybrid and private &#8212; in restructurings to be instituted in future pandemics.</span></div></body></html>
