Further, a much bolder shift in government and MDB strategies is needed to mobilize and augment private finance for infrastructure, so as to optimize official balance sheets for investments in both global public goods and economic development. We must also build strengthened and continuous public sector partnerships with philanthropic foundations to meet the needs of an expanded research agenda for pandemic PPR.</span></div><div left="72.28" right="86.27" top="397.96"><span x0="72.28" y0="397.96" x1="86.27" style="x0: 72.28; x1: 75.06; y0: 397.96; y1: 407.96; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">(9) </span><span x0="86.45" y0="397.96" x1="564.24" style="x0: 86.45; x1: 94.04; y0: 397.96; y1: 407.96; width: 7.59; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Black;">Develop insurance solutions for adverse compensation events associated with use of medical countermeasures. </span><span x0="174.99" y0="384.96" x1="563.97" style="x0: 174.99; x1: 180.73; y0: 384.96; y1: 394.96; width: 5.74; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">The MDBs should work with countries and private insurers to enable risk financing solutions to better protect LIC governments from the liability of adverse compensation events, particularly in the form of no-fault compensation schemes or an explicit compensation fund with pre-determined compensation awards.
