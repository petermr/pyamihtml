Governments will in many cases have to embark on reforms to mobilize and sustain additional domestic resources, so as to build up these pandemic-related capacities and strengthen public health systems more broadly, while at the same time enabling their economies to return to durable growth. Low- and middle-income countries will need to add about 1% of GDP to public spending on health over the next five years.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="564.85" top="549.51"><span x0="51.02" y0="549.51" x1="564.85" style="x0: 51.02; x1: 60.13; y0: 549.51; y1: 561.51; width: 9.11; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Black;">However, domestic actions alone will not prevent the next pandemic. Governments must collectively commit to increasing international financing for pandemic prevention and preparedness by at least US$75 billion over the next five years, or US$15 billion each year, with sustained investments in subsequent years. </span></div><div left="51.02" right="564.84" top="475.52"><span x0="51.02" y0="475.52" x1="564.84" style="x0: 51.02; x1: 57.91; y0: 475.52; y1: 487.52; width: 6.89; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Black;">The Panel assesses this to be the absolute minimum in new international investments required in the global public goods that are at the core of effective pandemic prevention and preparedness. </span><span x0="162.47" y0="445.92" x1="564.53" style="x0: 162.47; x1: 169.35; y0: 445.92; y1: 457.92; width: 6.89; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">The estimate excludes other investments that will contribute to resilience against future pandemics while benefiting countries in normal times. These complementary interventions &#8212; such as containing antimicrobial resistance, which alone will cost about US$9 billion annually, and building stronger and more inclusive national health and delivery systems &#8212; provide continuous value. Furthermore, the estimated minimum international investments are based on conservative assumptions on the scale of vaccine manufacturing capacity required in advance of a pandemic. Larger public investments to enable enhanced manufacturing capacity will indeed yield much higher returns. </span></div><div left="51.02" right="564.55" top="312.75"><span x0="51.02" y0="312.75" x1="564.55" style="x0: 51.02; x1: 57.91; y0: 312.75; y1: 324.75; width: 6.89; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">The minimum additional US$15 billion per year in international financing for pandemic preparedness is still a significant increase. It is a critical reset to a dangerously underfunded system. </span></div><div left="51.02" right="564.83" top="268.35"><span x0="51.02" y0="268.35" x1="564.83" style="x0: 51.02; x1: 57.91; y0: 268.35; y1: 280.35; width: 6.89; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Black;">These investments are a matter of financial responsibility, besides being a scientific and moral imperative. </span><span x0="158.01" y0="253.55" x1="564.6" style="x0: 158.01; x1: 164.9; y0: 253.55; y1: 265.55; width: 6.89; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">They will materially reduce the risk of events whose costs to government budgets alone are 700 times as large as the additional international investments per year that we propose, and 300 times as large as the total additional investments if we also take into account the domestic spending necessary. The full damage of another major pandemic, with its toll on lives and livelihoods, will be vastly larger. </span></div><div left="51.02" right="564.78" top="164.76"><span x0="51.02" y0="164.76" x1="564.78" style="x0: 51.02; x1: 59.24; y0: 164.76; y1: 176.76; width: 8.22; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Black;">Crucially, this additional international funding must add to, and not substitute for, existing support to advance global public health and development goals. </span><span x0="424.95" y0="149.97" x1="564.6" style="x0: 424.95; x1: 428.07; y0: 149.97; y1: 161.97; width: 3.12; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">It would be short-sighted to scale up efforts for pandemic prevention and preparedness by reallocating multilateral or bilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA) resources from other development priorities, particularly given the likely lasting negative impacts of the current pandemic on economic and human development in low- and lower-middle-income countries. The threat of pandemics to our collective security warrants a new and more sustainable global financing approach, beyond traditional aid, to invest in global public goods from which all nations benefit.</span></div></body></html>
