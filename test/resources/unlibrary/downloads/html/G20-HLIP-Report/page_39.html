However, utilizing new, low-cost modular manufacturing technologies that can interchangeably manufacture products across multiple platforms could reduce the need for &#8216;duplicative&#8217; capacity in the future, so procurement systems should be open to such proposals.</span></div><div left="72.28" right="564.0" top="396.5"><span x0="72.28" y0="396.5" x1="564.0" style="x0: 72.28; x1: 77.47; y0: 396.5; y1: 406.5; width: 5.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">a. During COVID-19, vaccine capacity installation and production was constrained by shortages of production capacity that could be repurposed, trained staff, and inputs. This led to costly delays in vaccination. A shortage of vaccines and inputs also increased incentives for countries to restrict exports and &#8216;hoard&#8217; vaccine doses.</span></div><div left="72.28" right="564.0" top="344.5"><span x0="72.28" y0="344.5" x1="564.0" style="x0: 72.28; x1: 78.39; y0: 344.5; y1: 354.5; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">b. To mitigate this problem for future pandemics, governments and international organizations should create standby production capacity for both finished vaccines and inputs in the vaccine supply chain. Such capacity includes having adequately trained staff, quality checks and procedures in place to ensure that facilities are ready to produce quickly when needed. Companies could submit proposals for providing this capacity which should be judged on both cost and other dimensions.</span></div><div left="72.28" right="561.32" top="266.5"><span x0="72.28" y0="266.5" x1="561.32" style="x0: 72.28; x1: 77.1; y0: 266.5; y1: 276.5; width: 4.82; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">c. As much as possible of this capacity should be kept occupied producing other products during non-pandemic times, which would have the benefit of keeping capacity warm, as it is difficult to rapidly &#8216;engage&#8217; manufacturing capacity that is left idle. It might also significantly reduce costs. </span></div><div left="72.28" right="564.05" top="214.5"><span x0="72.28" y0="214.5" x1="564.05" style="x0: 72.28; x1: 78.39; y0: 214.5; y1: 224.5; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">d. The aim should be to enable vaccine capacity to be ready for each of several vaccine candidates to be produced at scale so that mass vaccination could begin globally as soon as clinical trials prove successful, and for this to be possible even if only one of the candidates was successful.</span></div></body></html>
