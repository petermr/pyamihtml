National actions remain the foundation of global efforts to prevent and prepare for future pandemics.

The challenges today are considerably larger than they already were before the current pandemic. Poorer countries have very limited capacity to buffer their populations and economies through fiscal and monetary policies, apart from their scarce access to diagnostic tools and vaccines resulting in a much more prolonged crisis.
