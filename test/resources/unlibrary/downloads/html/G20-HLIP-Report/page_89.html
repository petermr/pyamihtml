This leveraging would depend on the capital requirements of each institution and the IFFEd&#8217;s credit rating. The financial efficiency of IFFEd also depends on the additional leveraging that comes from the treatment of donor guarantees as paid-in capital in IFFEd&#8217;s balance sheet. Under this model, additional grants can also be deployed &#8216;pari passu&#8217; with the loan to make the terms of the finance more concessional.</span></div><div left="50.52" right="563.51" top="559.38"><span x0="50.52" y0="559.38" x1="563.51" style="x0: 50.52; x1: 57.56; y0: 559.38; y1: 569.38; width: 7.04; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">Using the parameters developed for IFFEd &#8212; that have been reviewed and assured by credit-rating agencies &#8212; the proposed vehicle would require from donors commitments of 15 per cent in cash and 85 per cent in contingent commitments (guarantees) for every US$1 dollar of portfolio insurance. In turn, consultations with four large MDBs indicated that they would leverage this portfolio insurance four times if IFFEd was rated very strongly. Thus, for every 15 cents of cash, the vehicle would produce US$4 of financial support to clients, resulting in an overall leverage rate of 27 times. </span></div><div left="50.52" right="487.02" top="460.61"><span x0="50.52" y0="460.61" x1="487.02" style="x0: 50.52; x1: 57.37; y0: 460.61; y1: 470.61; width: 6.85; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Black;">Cost Calculations for Applying the IFFEd Model to Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness</span></div><div left="50.52" right="563.58" top="434.01"><span x0="50.52" y0="434.01" x1="563.58" style="x0: 50.52; x1: 57.56; y0: 434.01; y1: 444.01; width: 7.04; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">Although the IFFEd financing instrument was developed to increase education lending, its design can also be applied to vaccines, pandemic preparedness, or other global public health goods as long as the institutions have a strong credit rating and preferred creditor treatment with the capacity to manage these donor commitments and loans. </span></div><div left="50.52" right="563.51" top="380.81"><span x0="50.52" y0="380.81" x1="563.51" style="x0: 50.52; x1: 56.26; y0: 380.81; y1: 390.81; width: 5.74; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">The governance of any IFFEd-type vehicle for pandemic prevention and preparedness would rely as much as possible on existing arrangements and accountabilities. Donors would fund the paid-in capital and guarantees required, the vehicle&#8217;s independent board and contributors would decide on the magnitude and timing of the portfolio insurance to the MDBs, and the MDBs would make lending decisions.</span></div><div left="50.52" right="563.55" top="314.31"><span x0="50.52" y0="314.31" x1="563.55" style="x0: 50.52; x1: 57.56; y0: 314.31; y1: 324.31; width: 7.04; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">As an illustration, to provide an extra US$4.5 billion annually in financing to Middle-Income Countries (MICs) by the World Bank&#8217;s IBRD with the same grant element or concession equal to IDA-regular terms through a combination of a loan and a grant, would require an annual grant inflow of US$1.57 billion if this was done by using a standard capital increase mechanism and grants to recipients in conjunction with the loan to increase the grant element.</span></div><div left="50.52" right="563.51" top="247.81"><span x0="50.52" y0="247.81" x1="563.51" style="x0: 50.52; x1: 56.26; y0: 247.81; y1: 257.81; width: 5.74; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">This annual grant inflow from donors would be split between an increase in paid-in capital of US$0.73 billion (20 percent of the US$3.66 billion IBRD loan) and US$0.84 billion for the grant to the recipient to bring the total finance provided to IDA terms. </span></div><div left="50.52" right="563.55" top="194.61"><span x0="50.52" y0="194.61" x1="563.55" style="x0: 50.52; x1: 60.15; y0: 194.61; y1: 204.61; width: 9.63; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">With the IFFEd model, in comparison, the same increase in lending would require an annual grant inflow of US$0.98 billion split between paid-in capital of US$0.14 billion (accompanied by guarantees of US$0.78 billion) to support the loan, and the same grant of US$0.84 billion to recipients.
