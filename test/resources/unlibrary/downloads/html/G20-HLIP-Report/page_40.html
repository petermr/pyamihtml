Ethical, social and political considerations may prevent companies from charging very high prices during a pandemic which would allow them to recoup costs. Therefore, governments and international organizations will need to be prepared to cover a large portion of the costs of this capacity. To the extent that capacity can be used for other purposes, this will bring down costs and help ensure pandemic readiness. </span></div><div left="55.28" right="547.04" top="643.96"><span x0="55.28" y0="643.96" x1="547.04" style="x0: 55.28; x1: 58.43; y0: 643.96; y1: 653.96; width: 3.15; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">f. Contracting can be undertaken through a standard procurement process, in which governments and international organizations solicit bids from companies.</span></div><div left="55.28" right="547.06" top="604.96"><span x0="55.28" y0="604.96" x1="547.06" style="x0: 55.28; x1: 61.39; y0: 604.96; y1: 614.96; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">g. These bids should be judged on several dimensions. These include but are not limited to price, quantity, dual-use possibilities, speed to repurpose during a pandemic, geographical location, and reliability.</span></div><div left="69.45" right="547.08" top="565.96"><span x0="69.45" y0="565.96" x1="547.08" style="x0: 69.45; x1: 71.85; y0: 565.96; y1: 575.96; width: 2.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">i. For example, a bid which could use capacity to produce other valuable products in peace-time at low cost would be more attractive, both because the dual-use is valuable and because using capacity might ensure that it could be repurposed quickly and reliably during a pandemic. However, capacity which requires high and constant demand to stay &#8216;warm&#8217;, may be less attractive if that demand does not match social needs. </span></div><div left="69.45" right="547.03" top="487.96"><span x0="69.45" y0="487.96" x1="547.03" style="x0: 69.45; x1: 71.85; y0: 487.96; y1: 497.96; width: 2.4; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">ii. For certain more standardized inputs, stockpiles can be created. Once stockpiles are sufficient, the supplies can be sold and replenished, where ongoing production enables verification of capabilities for achieving contracted capabilities.</span></div><div left="34.01" right="49.87" top="436.16"><span x0="34.01" y0="436.16" x1="49.87" style="x0: 34.01; x1: 39.57; y0: 436.16; y1: 446.16; width: 5.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">31. </span><span x0="55.27" y0="436.16" x1="162.99" style="x0: 55.27; x1: 65.27; y0: 436.16; y1: 446.16; width: 10.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Black;">When a pandemic hits</span><span x0="162.88" y0="436.16" x1="547.03" style="x0: 162.88; x1: 165.66; y0: 436.16; y1: 446.16; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">, governments and international organizations should sign contracts to repurpose sufficient manufacturing capacity for each of many vaccine candidates, ahead of final regulatory approvals for the successful candidates. </span></div><div left="55.27" right="547.03" top="384.96"><span x0="55.27" y0="384.96" x1="547.03" style="x0: 55.27; x1: 60.46; y0: 384.96; y1: 394.96; width: 5.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">a. Sufficient capacity is needed to ensure rapid and equitable global access, including by the LICs and LMICs, which is critical to containing a pandemic everywhere. This will require global support. </span><span x0="466.84" y0="372.16" x1="547.23" style="x0: 466.84; x1: 469.8; y0: 372.16; y1: 382.16; width: 2.96; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Black;">In order to fund these contracts, a pool of flexibly deployable &#8216;at-risk&#8217; funds will be needed. </span></div><div left="55.27" right="362.99" top="333.76"><span x0="55.27" y0="333.76" x1="362.99" style="x0: 55.27; x1: 61.38; y0: 333.76; y1: 343.76; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">b.

Some kinds of PPE and medical equipment are useful for a broader set of pathogens than a specific vaccine, meaning it may be possible to maintain stockpiles in advance.</span></div></body></html>
