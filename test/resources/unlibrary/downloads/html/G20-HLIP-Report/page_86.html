National-level financing needs encompass measures that should be executed nationally, whose success, however, has direct global implications given the existence of global externalities. To avoid underinvestment and in light of existing budget constraints, we propose a formula for partial external financing of national level measures in low- and middle-income countries. </span></div><div left="34.02" right="547.05" top="588.06"><span x0="34.02" y0="588.06" x1="547.05" style="x0: 34.02; x1: 39.76; y0: 588.06; y1: 598.06; width: 5.74; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">The estimates provided are computed under the assumption that low-income countries receive international support to cover 88%</span><span x0="130.93" y0="579.14" x1="137.29" style="x0: 130.93; x1: 134.17; y0: 579.14; y1: 584.97; width: 3.24; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">67</span><span x0="139.56" y0="574.76" x1="547.0" style="x0: 139.56; x1: 145.5; y0: 574.76; y1: 584.76; width: 5.94; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">of financing needs. While a certain degree of local ownership is beneficial, these countries face severe budget constraints and a large opportunity cost to financing prevention and preparedness activities.

First and foremost, the cost focuses on the needs within the health sector. It does not make a costing of the whole-of-government approach, which would include prevention and preparedness activities in other sectors, such as water and sanitation or continuity of key services such as electricity supplies or transportation. Moreover, there is no unique definition of PPR and more or less extensive scope can be defined for some categories of prevention and preparedness. </span></div><div left="34.01" right="547.02" top="308.76"><span x0="34.01" y0="308.76" x1="547.02" style="x0: 34.01; x1: 36.61; y0: 308.76; y1: 318.76; width: 2.6; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">In particular, some restrictive assumptions have been made in four areas to exclude certain activities that have indirect but still significant impact on prevention and preparedness. </span></div><div left="55.27" right="63.25" top="269.16"><span x0="55.27" y0="269.16" x1="63.25" style="x0: 55.27; x1: 60.27; y0: 269.16; y1: 279.16; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0.549, 0.815]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">&#8226; Firstly, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which erodes the capacity to treat infections has been referred to as one of the big threats to future global health, which will be compounded by pandemics.

This cost is partly integrated into the McKinsey estimates but we exclude it from the values presented in our report. While there is some overlap and synergies between pandemic prevention and preparedness and AMR containment, AMR requirements for both animal and human health are relatively distinct. The World Bank&#8217;s estimates would increase investment needs presented for LMICs by nearly 40%, compared to the estimates presented in this report.</span></div><div left="34.02" right="38.65" top="130.77"><span x0="34.02" y0="130.77" x1="38.65" style="x0: 34.02; x1: 36.28; y0: 130.77; y1: 134.85; width: 2.27; font-size: 4.08; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">65</span><span x0="41.11" y0="127.71" x1="544.23" style="x0: 41.11; x1: 45.12; y0: 127.71; y1: 134.71; width: 4.02; font-size: 7.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">This is in line with the G-Finder survey: https://policy-cures-website-assets.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/15055816/G- FINDER-2020_Final-Report.pdf</span></div><div left="34.02" right="38.68" top="111.13"><span x0="34.02" y0="111.13" x1="38.68" style="x0: 34.02; x1: 36.28; y0: 111.13; y1: 115.22; width: 2.27; font-size: 4.08; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">66</span><span x0="41.1" y0="108.07" x1="546.26" style="x0: 41.1; x1: 45.12; y0: 108.07; y1: 115.07; width: 4.02; font-size: 7.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">The assumption of a 30% funding share for the private sector in establishing scaled-up at-ready manufacturing capacity is in-line with the analyses by the AHT group and others.
