However, while these two reports are used as the primary baseline, we have modified certain estimates following our consultations with industry experts to be consistent with GPMB&#8217;s categories. This included triangulating the estimates with those from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI) for the development costs of new diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics, and from Georgetown University on country-level financing.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="564.03" top="588.06"><span x0="51.02" y0="588.06" x1="564.03" style="x0: 51.02; x1: 57.32; y0: 588.06; y1: 598.06; width: 6.3; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">Both the WHO and McKinsey studies apply a bottom-up methodology estimating total prevention and preparedness needs by identifying the set of functions or institutions necessary at global level, including coordination functions and the key functions which surveillance and health systems need to provide at country-level. The estimates at country-level are broken down according to income groups: High Income Countries (HIC), Medium Income Countries (MIC), and Low Income Countries (LIC). The Panel&#8217;s approach defines international financing as the public financing needed for global commons: the global-level capacities and the funding to incentivize countries to make the necessary investment in their surveillance and health systems. McKinsey computes only total needs, while WHO estimates both total needs and international financing requirements. </span></div><div left="51.02" right="563.96" top="468.36"><span x0="51.02" y0="468.36" x1="563.96" style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.76; y0: 468.36; y1: 478.36; width: 5.74; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">The WHO and McKinsey approaches differ in a number of respects, in particular in the scope and cost calculation methods or references. It is hence difficult to make straightforward comparisons of the estimates yielded by the two approaches. Some additional triangulation of data and judgments had to be made so that the two sets of data could be incorporated within the GPMB&#8217;s framework, and our best estimates derived. </span></div><div left="51.02" right="564.08" top="401.86"><span x0="51.02" y0="401.86" x1="564.08" style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.76; y0: 401.86; y1: 411.86; width: 5.74; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">The report has not retained the WHO&#8217;s estimate for HIC spending as it was a significant outlier when compared with other estimates of needs</span><span x0="160.43" y0="392.94" x1="166.97" style="x0: 160.43; x1: 163.67; y0: 392.94; y1: 398.77; width: 3.24; font-size: 5.83; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">63</span><span x0="166.97" y0="388.56" x1="564.04" style="x0: 166.97; x1: 169.75; y0: 388.56; y1: 398.56; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">.

McKinsey&#8217;s approach identifies gaps compared to pre-defined targets for each function of prevention and preparedness, and distributes the total costs over a ten-year period with some degree of frontloading. For the purpose of this report, the frontloading embedded in McKinsey&#8217;s calculations has been slightly amplified, reflecting the need to catch up from a long period of underfunding, and the required urgency. Our estimates for the first five years assume that they would require the spending of 60% of the total ten-year figure. However, as highlighted above, our estimates for supply capacity for medical countermeasures are very conservative. </span></div><div left="51.03" right="564.06" top="242.26"><span x0="51.03" y0="242.26" x1="564.06" style="x0: 51.03; x1: 58.07; y0: 242.26; y1: 252.26; width: 7.04; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; stroke: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">Additionally, the cost of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been excluded from the McKinsey estimates, for reasons explained below.
