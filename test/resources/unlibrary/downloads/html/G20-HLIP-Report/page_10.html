As the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board highlights, the system is fragmented and complex, and lacks accountability and oversight of financing of pandemic preparedness. We must address this by establishing a governance mechanism that integrates the key players in the global health security and financing ecosystem, with the World Health Organization (WHO) at the center.</span></div><div left="34.02" right="547.83" top="613.08"><span x0="34.02" y0="613.08" x1="547.83" style="x0: 34.02; x1: 40.9; y0: 613.08; y1: 625.08; width: 6.89; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Black;">To plug this gap, we propose establishing a new Global Health Threats Board (Board). </span><span x0="34.02" y0="598.68" x1="547.52" style="x0: 34.02; x1: 40.9; y0: 598.68; y1: 610.68; width: 6.89; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">The proposal builds loosely on the model of the Financial Stability Board, established by the G20 in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and which has operated successfully as a collective to contain risks to the global financial system. </span></div><div left="34.02" right="547.84" top="541.08"><span x0="34.02" y0="541.08" x1="547.84" style="x0: 34.02; x1: 40.9; y0: 541.08; y1: 553.08; width: 6.89; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Black;">This new governance mechanism will bring together the worlds of health and finance.

The Panel supports the establishment of this top-level political leadership council, to mobilize the strong collective commitment required for global health security. The Board, on the other hand, will aim more specifically to match tightly networked global health governance with financing, which are both critical enablers to reduce pandemic risks. It should take reference from the initiatives and work of the proposed Global Health Threats Council, to ensure a complementarity of functions.</span></div><div left="34.02" right="547.87" top="325.08"><span x0="34.02" y0="325.08" x1="547.87" style="x0: 34.02; x1: 40.9; y0: 325.08; y1: 337.08; width: 6.89; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Black;">The Board would provide systemic financial oversight aimed at enabling proper and timely resourcing of capacities to detect, prevent and rapidly respond to another pandemic, and to ensure the most effective use of funds. </span><span x0="277.61" y0="296.28" x1="547.43" style="x0: 277.61; x1: 280.73; y0: 296.28; y1: 308.28; width: 3.12; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.137, 0.123, 0.126]; font-family: WXJFMZ+AvenirLTStd-Roman;">It must join up the efforts of international bodies, with clearly delineated responsibilities that match their comparative strengths, and ensure that the system fully engages and leverages the capabilities of the private sector and non-state actors.
