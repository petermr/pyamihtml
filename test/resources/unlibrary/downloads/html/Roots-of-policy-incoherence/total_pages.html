It sets out the incentives that drive this incoherence and the opportunities for greater impact being missed through it, and concludes with a brief consideration of how institu- tional reform can support better policymaking across these domains.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="535.5" top="314.3"><span x0="76.5" y0="314.3" x1="535.5" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 85.99; y0: 314.3; y1: 325.8; width: 9.49; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Most governments treat domestic policy as an isolated domain over which to pursue purely do-mestic priorities, while international development policy and global public goods (GPG) policy are barely distinguished from each other. </span><span x0="278.33" y0="287.3" x1="535.5" style="x0: 278.33; x1: 283.62; y0: 287.3; y1: 298.8; width: 5.29; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Such a conceptualization of the policy space leads to in- coherence: one domain undermining another, and opportunities for positive reinforcement left beg- ging.

What&#8217;s more, action on international development and global public goods is too often considered interchangeable, a conceptual error that undermines both. These errors arise from a failure to adequately consider whether policy actions in different domains are comple-ments, substitutes, or independent of each other. Treating them as independent when they are in fact complements, or treating them as substitutes when they are actually independent, leads to an ineffi- cient policy mix, and ultimately muted impact.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="245.02" top="141.3"><span x0="76.5" y0="141.3" x1="245.02" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 82.62; y0: 141.3; y1: 152.8; width: 6.12; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">This short note proceeds as follows. </span><span x0="244.79" y0="141.3" x1="537.72" style="x0: 244.79; x1: 250.63; y0: 141.3; y1: 152.8; width: 5.84; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">The next section introduces the conceptual basis for considering policy actions as complements, substitutes, or independent, and the implications this has for how they should be set.

First, there are those that are primarily self-interested, aimed at the betterment of the domestic population (now and in the future). I call these &#8220;domestic policy concerns,&#8221; aimed at influencing domestic outcomes. Second, there are those that are primar-ily about improving welfare in other countries. These policies may have second order benefits to the country implementing them, but the primary objective is the betterment of people in other countries. These are grouped under &#8220;development policy concerns,&#8221; aimed at improving international devel-opment outcomes. Third, there are policies that benefit the implementing countries, with positive externalities that accrue to other countries. These are classed as &#8220;global public good policy concerns,&#8221; aimed at improving outcomes with respect to shared global challenges. </span></div><div left="76.5" right="468.0" top="510.21"><span x0="76.5" y0="510.21" x1="468.0" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 82.62; y0: 510.21; y1: 521.71; width: 6.12; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Three&#8212;hopefully uncontroversial&#8212;assumptions set the conceptual argument up. </span><span x0="469.25" y0="510.21" x1="537.71" style="x0: 469.25; x1: 474.81; y0: 510.21; y1: 521.71; width: 5.55; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">First, all three policy areas matter. That is, we care about results in all three, not just any one. Second, we care about effectiveness of action or policy in each sphere and overall. There is a minimal level of effectiveness in each sphere we seek to achieve, and a desire to maximise effectiveness in each sphere, and the overall amount of &#8220;good&#8221; achieved. Third, that these policy spheres interact with each other in stronger and weaker ways. For example, domestic outcomes affect global public good outcomes and development outcomes, both positively and negatively. These relationships may not be symmetrical, in that influ-ences in one direction, for example from domestic outcomes to development outcomes, may be much stronger than the influence of development outcomes on domestic outcomes.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="537.74" top="377.71"><span x0="76.5" y0="377.71" x1="537.74" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 83.92; y0: 377.71; y1: 389.21; width: 7.42; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Given these three assumptions, the content of the relationship between different policy domains determines what constitutes a coherent policy set. </span><span x0="321.98" y0="364.21" x1="535.5" style="x0: 321.98; x1: 327.27; y0: 364.21; y1: 375.71; width: 5.29; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Since governments care about multiple objec-tives over multiple domains, it should consider the net effect of its policies in the round when taking any new action. This, in itself, is not in any sense a novel argument: the idea of coherence underlies, for example, CGD&#8217;s Commitment to Development Index. Differentiating the precise form of interde- pendence, however, leads to richer conclusions.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="537.72" top="285.71"><span x0="76.5" y0="285.71" x1="537.72" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 85.92; y0: 285.71; y1: 297.21; width: 9.42; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Where policies or outcomes in one domain are fully independent of the policies and outcomes in another, policy coherence is easy: nothing a government does in one domain affects the other. </span><span x0="529.23" y0="272.21" x1="537.71" style="x0: 529.23; x1: 535.5; y0: 272.21; y1: 283.71; width: 6.27; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">A good example here might be policy concerning football club ownership (where policy varies substan-tially between countries) and policy on the funding of energy projects in third countries. It&#8217;s hard to think of a way in which any policy choice in one could possibly affect the set of possible outcomes of the other, or alter in any way the effectiveness of any chosen policy. No matter how football clubs are governed, any choice of restriction (or lack thereof) on the funding energy projects abroad will operate as intended. Were the policy space entirely populated by such policy sets, each individual policy could be determined separately, changed as seen fit and implemented in any fashion without ever reducing the overall efficiency of government action. And it is indeed the case that most policy actions are func- tionally independent of most others.</span><span x0="246.86" y0="155.5" x1="249.19" style="x0: 246.86; x1: 249.19; y0: 155.5; y1: 162.2; width: 2.33; font-size: 6.7; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">1</span><span x0="252.44" y0="150.71" x1="537.71" style="x0: 252.44; x1: 259.82; y0: 150.71; y1: 162.21; width: 7.38; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Unfortunately in the remaining cases, governments often set policy as if independence holds, when in fact it does not, leading to suboptimal outcomes.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="537.28" top="103.2"><span x0="76.5" y0="103.2" x1="537.28" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 79.62; y0: 103.2; y1: 112.2; width: 3.12; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">1 &#8220;Functionally&#8221; independent because there are many cases where there is some theoretical pathway through which one policy may ultimately exert some weak or imperceptible influence on another policy domain.

These are complements because increasing vaccination rates at home reduce health risk from contracting COVID, but also increase the return to vaccinating people in countries with lower vaccination rates, for two reasons. First, reducing the pool of infected and unvac-cinated people in whom new COVID variants may emerge increases the value of existing vaccinations given at home. Second, by reducing infections and hospitalisations abroad, the return to resuming normal economic and trade ties increases. Doing only one well mutes the returns; doing both well amplifies them.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="349.95" top="430.0"><span x0="76.5" y0="430.0" x1="349.95" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 83.53; y0: 430.0; y1: 441.5; width: 7.03; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Confusing these relationships makes policy less effective. </span><span x0="350.01" y0="430.0" x1="535.5" style="x0: 350.01; x1: 356.15; y0: 430.0; y1: 441.5; width: 6.14; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Because the implications for what an op-timal policy set looks like vary with the kind of relationship between pairs of policy action, getting them mixed up leads not just to incoherence, but missed opportunities and self-sabotage.

In fact, they are complements: the susceptibility of a population to COVID-19 depends on both its level of protection and the amount of the virus in circulation. There comes a point&#8212;likely long past in many developed countries&#8212;where inching protection of the population up marginally will have much less effect than reducing the global burden of disease. More generally, as your demand for one (domestic vaccination) increases, so should your demand for the other (vacci- nation in largely unvaccinated places) This will only become more true as countries relax travel re-strictions. Indeed travel restrictions are a second (or third, or fourth) best solution to a policy problem in which the first best solution would have been rapid deployment of vaccines globally. By failing to recognize the complementarity of domestic and international policy, both were undermined.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="535.5" top="103.2"><span x0="76.5" y0="103.2" x1="535.5" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 80.7; y0: 103.2; y1: 112.2; width: 4.2; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">2 This is, of course, a great simplification, as supporting correspondent banks will have spillover benefits on their ability to en-gage with third countries; meanwhile changing policy at home affects many other countries at once.

This implies that climate action substitutes for action on development (or is a complement to other development aid and thus increases its effectiveness). Yet at best, development outcomes and climate outcomes are mainly independent. Developing countries&#8212;and particular, African ones&#8212;contribute a small proportion of global emissions (Moss, 2020), so action on climate in developing countries will normally either have a small effect on global climate change goals (for most mitigation policy) or primarily benefit only those in developing countries (for most ad-aptation policy). Funding global public good climate activity is thus mainly good for only development or only climate objectives, and not both (except for a small number of opportunities that may genu-inely thread the needle of being good for development and good for global climate objectives, which are the subject of a forthcoming set of papers). Even worse, some policies that seek to limit emissions in developing countries in the name of global climate change objectives may be actively bad for devel-opment (Ramachandran, 2021) while also being next to meaningless for climate change goals. </span></div><div left="76.5" right="535.5" top="481.5"><span x0="76.5" y0="481.5" x1="535.5" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 85.99; y0: 481.5; y1: 493.0; width: 9.49; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Migration policy and development policy are usually thought of as either independent or comple-ments in the wrong direction. </span><span x0="223.95" y0="468.0" x1="535.5" style="x0: 223.95; x1: 231.24; y0: 468.0; y1: 479.5; width: 7.29; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Developed countries have often set migration policy in such a fash-ion as to minimize inflows of people from developing countries, often while maintaining a large and generous ODA budget.
