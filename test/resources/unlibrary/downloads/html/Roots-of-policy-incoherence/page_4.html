This implies that climate action substitutes for action on development (or is a complement to other development aid and thus increases its effectiveness). Yet at best, development outcomes and climate outcomes are mainly independent. Developing countries&#8212;and particular, African ones&#8212;contribute a small proportion of global emissions (Moss, 2020), so action on climate in developing countries will normally either have a small effect on global climate change goals (for most mitigation policy) or primarily benefit only those in developing countries (for most ad-aptation policy). Funding global public good climate activity is thus mainly good for only development or only climate objectives, and not both (except for a small number of opportunities that may genu-inely thread the needle of being good for development and good for global climate objectives, which are the subject of a forthcoming set of papers). Even worse, some policies that seek to limit emissions in developing countries in the name of global climate change objectives may be actively bad for devel-opment (Ramachandran, 2021) while also being next to meaningless for climate change goals. </span></div><div left="76.5" right="535.5" top="481.5"><span x0="76.5" y0="481.5" x1="535.5" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 85.99; y0: 481.5; y1: 493.0; width: 9.49; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Migration policy and development policy are usually thought of as either independent or comple-ments in the wrong direction. </span><span x0="223.95" y0="468.0" x1="535.5" style="x0: 223.95; x1: 231.24; y0: 468.0; y1: 479.5; width: 7.29; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Developed countries have often set migration policy in such a fash-ion as to minimize inflows of people from developing countries, often while maintaining a large and generous ODA budget. For a long time, these domains were treated as broadly independent, set in unrelated policy silos, while research increasingly suggests that they are positive complements&#8212;that migration (and even travel) to developed countries exerts a positive effect on development in home countries (Koczan et al., 2021; Umana-Dajud, 2019). More recently political rhetoric has suggested that spending on development was an effective way to reduce migration, despite research from a number of angles showing that the exact opposite was true (Angelucci, 2015; Clemens &amp; Mendola, 2020). </span></div><div left="76.5" right="537.71" top="349.0"><span x0="76.5" y0="349.0" x1="537.71" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 82.84; y0: 349.0; y1: 360.5; width: 6.34; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Each of these examples demonstrate the same basic conceptual error: failing to correctly identify the nature and direction of the interaction between policy or outcome pairs. </span><span x0="440.44" y0="335.5" x1="537.71" style="x0: 440.44; x1: 446.28; y0: 335.5; y1: 347.0; width: 5.84; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">That said it would be na&#239;ve to see these purely as cognitive failings. They stem from the structure of incentives and insti-tutions that govern and set bounds to policy making. This makes them difficult to resolve, but also provides a framework for how to do so.</span></div><div left="76.62" right="452.58" top="265.68"><span x0="76.62" y0="265.68" x1="452.58" style="x0: 76.62; x1: 83.59; y0: 265.68; y1: 279.18; width: 6.97; font-size: 13.5; fill: [1, 0.12, 0.21, 0.44]; font-family: BWUTLP+TheMixC4s-Plain;">THE INSTITUTIONAL ROOTS OF CONVENIENT MISCONCEPTION </span></div><div left="76.5" right="537.73" top="243.2"><span x0="76.5" y0="243.2" x1="537.73" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 80.61; y0: 243.2; y1: 254.7; width: 4.11; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">In each of these cases, conceptual errors are driven primarily by incentives and institutional structures that facilitate convenient misconception. </span><span x0="327.82" y0="229.7" x1="537.74" style="x0: 327.82; x1: 335.25; y0: 229.7; y1: 241.2; width: 7.43; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">None of the foregoing analysis for any pair of mismatched policies will be new to experts (or even well-informed observers) of them. Understanding why they arise requires a more sophisticated theory than simple misunderstanding or lack of access to information.
