This note sets out how the conceptual and analytical incoherence of policy set in developed countries across these three domains undermines their own effectiveness&#8212;most notably on international development and shared global challenges. It sets out the incentives that drive this incoherence and the opportunities for greater impact being missed through it, and concludes with a brief consideration of how institu- tional reform can support better policymaking across these domains.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="535.5" top="314.3"><span x0="76.5" y0="314.3" x1="535.5" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 85.99; y0: 314.3; y1: 325.8; width: 9.49; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Most governments treat domestic policy as an isolated domain over which to pursue purely do-mestic priorities, while international development policy and global public goods (GPG) policy are barely distinguished from each other. </span><span x0="278.33" y0="287.3" x1="535.5" style="x0: 278.33; x1: 283.62; y0: 287.3; y1: 298.8; width: 5.29; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Such a conceptualization of the policy space leads to in- coherence: one domain undermining another, and opportunities for positive reinforcement left beg- ging. Domestic policy is pursued without much thought to its effects on GPG and development pol-icy, while the latter two are either an afterthought with respect to their impact on domestic policy or worse, treated transactionally. What&#8217;s more, action on international development and global public goods is too often considered interchangeable, a conceptual error that undermines both. These errors arise from a failure to adequately consider whether policy actions in different domains are comple-ments, substitutes, or independent of each other. Treating them as independent when they are in fact complements, or treating them as substitutes when they are actually independent, leads to an ineffi- cient policy mix, and ultimately muted impact.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="245.02" top="141.3"><span x0="76.5" y0="141.3" x1="245.02" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 82.62; y0: 141.3; y1: 152.8; width: 6.12; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">This short note proceeds as follows. </span><span x0="244.79" y0="141.3" x1="537.72" style="x0: 244.79; x1: 250.63; y0: 141.3; y1: 152.8; width: 5.84; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">The next section introduces the conceptual basis for considering policy actions as complements, substitutes, or independent, and the implications this has for how they should be set. The third section applies this framework to a few examples where policy coher-ence could be improved by adopting this approach. The fourth section discusses the incentive and institutional barriers that hamper its adoption. Finally, the note concludes with consideration of how institutional reform can support improved, more internally consistent policymaking.</span></div></body></html>
