Mean-while, the UNFCCC should set rules or targets on minimum non-ODA spend on GPGs in the climate space. This could even happen at the national level, as Norway&#8217;s mooted move to completely separate ODA from GPG spend suggests. </span></div><div left="76.5" right="375.97" top="565.0"><span x0="76.5" y0="565.0" x1="375.97" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 80.61; y0: 565.0; y1: 576.5; width: 4.11; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Increase the use of impact-focused modalities of policy action. </span><span x0="376.26" y0="565.0" x1="537.71" style="x0: 376.26; x1: 383.19; y0: 565.0; y1: 576.5; width: 6.92; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">CGD has long argued for increased use of cash-on-delivery modes of aid, and pioneered the use of an advance market commitment (AMC) for vaccine delivery in developing countries (AMC Working Group, 2005; Birdsall &amp; Savedoff, 2010).But there is no reason why such methods should be limited to any one policy domain. Indeed, the more complex the interdependencies under consideration, the more we should consider using AMCs, cash-on-delivery, and results-based financing more generally, to incentivize action and policy that genuinely achieves multiple objectives and mitigates the temptation for rhetoric or convenience over impact.</span><span x0="111.51" y0="475.29" x1="114.62" style="x0: 111.51; x1: 114.62; y0: 475.29; y1: 481.99; width: 3.12; font-size: 6.7; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">5</span></div><div left="76.5" right="537.74" top="446.0"><span x0="76.5" y0="446.0" x1="537.74" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 82.62; y0: 446.0; y1: 457.5; width: 6.12; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Perfect policy is unachievable (and indeed may not exist); but institutional solutions for the most egregious failures of policy coherence should be possible. </span><span x0="348.16" y0="432.5" x1="535.5" style="x0: 348.16; x1: 353.71; y0: 432.5; y1: 444.0; width: 5.55; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Facing multiple global, domestic, and de-velopment challenges, governments (especially those with fairly secure governing mandates) should be thinking very carefully about how to get the most from limited resources.
