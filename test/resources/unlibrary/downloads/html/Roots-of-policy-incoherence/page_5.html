To the extent that voters are unable to rationally assess a politician&#8217;s impact on the outcomes they care about, and reward them accordingly, (Wolfers, 2007), and depending on the relative electoral returns of different policy outcomes or domains, politicians maximize their returns by treating them as independent. This is true even in the direct knowledge that the actual outcomes they are pursuing will be undermined by treating them as such.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="471.8" top="589.5"><span x0="76.5" y0="589.5" x1="471.8" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 81.89; y0: 589.5; y1: 601.0; width: 5.39; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Second is the mistaken and under-scrutinised belief that all good things are alike. </span><span x0="472.26" y0="589.5" x1="537.71" style="x0: 472.26; x1: 478.1; y0: 589.5; y1: 601.0; width: 5.84; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">This might be described as the Anna Karenina fallacy, from the oft-quoted first lines of Tolstoy&#8217;s novel: &#8220;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in their own way.&#8221;</span><span x0="393.74" y0="567.29" x1="397.09" style="x0: 393.74; x1: 397.09; y0: 567.29; y1: 573.99; width: 3.35; font-size: 6.7; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">4</span><span x0="399.47" y0="562.5" x1="537.7" style="x0: 399.47; x1: 406.71; y0: 562.5; y1: 574.0; width: 7.25; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Governments treat policy and effort dealing with &#8220;good deeds&#8221; as interchangeable&#8212;hence the belief that working on climate change is somehow the same as working on development, and vice versa, and the idea that girls&#8217; education and climate change are interchangeable deep complements when in fact, more education is likely to increase emissions (Devonald et al., 2021).</span></div><div left="76.5" right="343.06" top="484.0"><span x0="76.5" y0="484.0" x1="343.06" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 82.62; y0: 484.0; y1: 495.5; width: 6.12; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Third is the political and fiscal convenience of win-wins. </span><span x0="342.53" y0="484.0" x1="537.72" style="x0: 342.53; x1: 348.37; y0: 484.0; y1: 495.5; width: 5.84; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">The most obvious reason why development aid is used on things that are not particularly good for development is not mistaken analysis, which is a useful rhetorical cover, but fiscal convenience. Many governments begrudge the use of scarce fiscal resources on activities with the primary aim of bettering welfare in developing countries (Dissanay-ake, 2021). One way they seek to swallow this bitter pill is by using the money to achieve orthogonal objectives, be that climate change (a GPG objective) or domestic objectives (such as increased trade or exports).</span></div><div left="76.5" right="414.58" top="378.5"><span x0="76.5" y0="378.5" x1="414.58" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 82.62; y0: 378.5; y1: 390.0; width: 6.12; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">These mechanisms suggest a limit to simple information interventions. </span><span x0="414.33" y0="378.5" x1="537.69" style="x0: 414.33; x1: 420.18; y0: 378.5; y1: 390.0; width: 5.84; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">The next section suggests a few institutional reforms that can support better, more coherent policymaking across domains.</span></div><div left="76.62" right="458.86" top="335.68"><span x0="76.62" y0="335.68" x1="458.86" style="x0: 76.62; x1: 84.49; y0: 335.68; y1: 349.18; width: 7.87; font-size: 13.5; fill: [1, 0.12, 0.21, 0.44]; font-family: BWUTLP+TheMixC4s-Plain;">CHANGING THE INCENTIVES REQUIRES INSTITUTIONAL ACTION </span></div><div left="76.5" right="537.71" top="313.2"><span x0="76.5" y0="313.2" x1="537.71" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 83.18; y0: 313.2; y1: 324.7; width: 6.68; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Addressing these root causes of policy incoherence requires more than simply better educating politicians and the public. </span><span x0="205.36" y0="299.7" x1="535.5" style="x0: 205.36; x1: 209.01; y0: 299.7; y1: 311.2; width: 3.65; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Instead, reforms could and should focus on how to set limits on govern- ment action across domains, and how to assess their net effect.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="537.71" top="261.7"><span x0="76.5" y0="261.7" x1="537.71" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 82.62; y0: 261.7; y1: 273.2; width: 6.12; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">The development of a policy analysis equivalent to the UK&#8217;s Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). </span><span x0="76.5" y0="248.2" x1="537.75" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 83.81; y0: 248.2; y1: 259.7; width: 7.31; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">One of the reasons why the electorally optimal strategy for policymaking is often not aligned with the optimal policy set defined by outcomes in each policy domain is that there is no independent institu- tion with a mandate to investigate the likely net effect of policy in the way the OBR is tasked with pro-ducing accepted economic and fiscal forecasts. Such an institution would have a harder job, needing to marshal expertise across several domains, and often using less data than is available on government spending, but would play an important role. Of course, think tanks and research institutes also aspire to this function, and could inform such a body. But what makes the OBR a strong institution is that the </span></div><div left="76.5" right="535.5" top="125.2"><span x0="76.5" y0="125.2" x1="535.5" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 80.8; y0: 125.2; y1: 134.2; width: 4.3; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">3  Indeed Bryan Caplan argues against an extensive role for the state on the basis that voters are irrational and unable to effec- tively hold it to account (Caplan, 2009). I don&#8217;t go down that path here, but the basic argument that voters are&#8212;understand- ably&#8212;imperfectly informed and rationally outsource the job of deep policy analysis to others is the basis of this argument.4 Quoted from (Tolstoy, 2013), Pevear and Volokhonsky&#8217;s translation. Both Stefan Dercon and Dan Honig have previously alluded to the &#8220;Anna Karenina principle&#8221; in their work, though each focuses on the second clause rather than the first &#8211; looking at how fragile and conflict affected states are each fragile in a different way.</span></div></body></html>
