First, there are those that are primarily self-interested, aimed at the betterment of the domestic population (now and in the future). I call these &#8220;domestic policy concerns,&#8221; aimed at influencing domestic outcomes. Second, there are those that are primar-ily about improving welfare in other countries. These policies may have second order benefits to the country implementing them, but the primary objective is the betterment of people in other countries. These are grouped under &#8220;development policy concerns,&#8221; aimed at improving international devel-opment outcomes. Third, there are policies that benefit the implementing countries, with positive externalities that accrue to other countries. These are classed as &#8220;global public good policy concerns,&#8221; aimed at improving outcomes with respect to shared global challenges. </span></div><div left="76.5" right="468.0" top="510.21"><span x0="76.5" y0="510.21" x1="468.0" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 82.62; y0: 510.21; y1: 521.71; width: 6.12; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Three&#8212;hopefully uncontroversial&#8212;assumptions set the conceptual argument up. </span><span x0="469.25" y0="510.21" x1="537.71" style="x0: 469.25; x1: 474.81; y0: 510.21; y1: 521.71; width: 5.55; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">First, all three policy areas matter. That is, we care about results in all three, not just any one. Second, we care about effectiveness of action or policy in each sphere and overall. There is a minimal level of effectiveness in each sphere we seek to achieve, and a desire to maximise effectiveness in each sphere, and the overall amount of &#8220;good&#8221; achieved. Third, that these policy spheres interact with each other in stronger and weaker ways. For example, domestic outcomes affect global public good outcomes and development outcomes, both positively and negatively. These relationships may not be symmetrical, in that influ-ences in one direction, for example from domestic outcomes to development outcomes, may be much stronger than the influence of development outcomes on domestic outcomes.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="537.74" top="377.71"><span x0="76.5" y0="377.71" x1="537.74" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 83.92; y0: 377.71; y1: 389.21; width: 7.42; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Given these three assumptions, the content of the relationship between different policy domains determines what constitutes a coherent policy set. </span><span x0="321.98" y0="364.21" x1="535.5" style="x0: 321.98; x1: 327.27; y0: 364.21; y1: 375.71; width: 5.29; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Since governments care about multiple objec-tives over multiple domains, it should consider the net effect of its policies in the round when taking any new action. This, in itself, is not in any sense a novel argument: the idea of coherence underlies, for example, CGD&#8217;s Commitment to Development Index. Differentiating the precise form of interde- pendence, however, leads to richer conclusions.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="537.72" top="285.71"><span x0="76.5" y0="285.71" x1="537.72" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 85.92; y0: 285.71; y1: 297.21; width: 9.42; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Where policies or outcomes in one domain are fully independent of the policies and outcomes in another, policy coherence is easy: nothing a government does in one domain affects the other. </span><span x0="529.23" y0="272.21" x1="537.71" style="x0: 529.23; x1: 535.5; y0: 272.21; y1: 283.71; width: 6.27; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">A good example here might be policy concerning football club ownership (where policy varies substan-tially between countries) and policy on the funding of energy projects in third countries. It&#8217;s hard to think of a way in which any policy choice in one could possibly affect the set of possible outcomes of the other, or alter in any way the effectiveness of any chosen policy. No matter how football clubs are governed, any choice of restriction (or lack thereof) on the funding energy projects abroad will operate as intended. Were the policy space entirely populated by such policy sets, each individual policy could be determined separately, changed as seen fit and implemented in any fashion without ever reducing the overall efficiency of government action. And it is indeed the case that most policy actions are func- tionally independent of most others.</span><span x0="246.86" y0="155.5" x1="249.19" style="x0: 246.86; x1: 249.19; y0: 155.5; y1: 162.2; width: 2.33; font-size: 6.7; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">1</span><span x0="252.44" y0="150.71" x1="537.71" style="x0: 252.44; x1: 259.82; y0: 150.71; y1: 162.21; width: 7.38; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Unfortunately in the remaining cases, governments often set policy as if independence holds, when in fact it does not, leading to suboptimal outcomes.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="537.28" top="103.2"><span x0="76.5" y0="103.2" x1="537.28" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 79.62; y0: 103.2; y1: 112.2; width: 3.12; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">1 &#8220;Functionally&#8221; independent because there are many cases where there is some theoretical pathway through which one policy may ultimately exert some weak or imperceptible influence on another policy domain. We will ignore such pathways here, though in aggregate they may matter rather a lot for what the optimal policy set is, since there is no practical way to imagine policymaking accounting for them.</span></div></body></html>
