For example, if domes- tic policy governing the practice of making remittances to developing countries were to have indis- tinguishable effects from international development policy to improve reporting standards for corre-spondent banks, policy to achieve either one would achieve outcomes relating to remittance flows and either could be pursued without the other to that end.</span><span x0="321.75" y0="618.79" x1="324.89" style="x0: 321.75; x1: 324.89; y0: 618.79; y1: 625.49; width: 3.13; font-size: 6.7; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">2</span></div><div left="76.5" right="535.5" top="589.5"><span x0="76.5" y0="589.5" x1="535.5" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 85.92; y0: 589.5; y1: 601.0; width: 9.42; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">When outcomes in one domain complement outcomes in another domain, achieving one ampli-fies action in the other&#8212;and failing to achieve one undermines the other&#8212;an optimal policy set would increase effort on both. </span><span x0="224.75" y0="562.5" x1="535.5" style="x0: 224.75; x1: 230.59; y0: 562.5; y1: 574.0; width: 5.84; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Take, for example, action to vaccinate people against COVID-19 do-mestically, aimed at reducing infections and adverse health outcomes, and action to increase vaccine availability in developing countries. These are complements because increasing vaccination rates at home reduce health risk from contracting COVID, but also increase the return to vaccinating people in countries with lower vaccination rates, for two reasons. First, reducing the pool of infected and unvac-cinated people in whom new COVID variants may emerge increases the value of existing vaccinations given at home. Second, by reducing infections and hospitalisations abroad, the return to resuming normal economic and trade ties increases. Doing only one well mutes the returns; doing both well amplifies them.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="349.95" top="430.0"><span x0="76.5" y0="430.0" x1="349.95" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 83.53; y0: 430.0; y1: 441.5; width: 7.03; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Confusing these relationships makes policy less effective. </span><span x0="350.01" y0="430.0" x1="535.5" style="x0: 350.01; x1: 356.15; y0: 430.0; y1: 441.5; width: 6.14; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">Because the implications for what an op-timal policy set looks like vary with the kind of relationship between pairs of policy action, getting them mixed up leads not just to incoherence, but missed opportunities and self-sabotage. The next section briefly sets outs examples of this.</span></div><div left="76.62" right="468.71" top="360.18"><span x0="76.62" y0="360.18" x1="468.71" style="x0: 76.62; x1: 84.05; y0: 360.18; y1: 373.68; width: 7.42; font-size: 13.5; fill: [1, 0.12, 0.21, 0.44]; font-family: BWUTLP+TheMixC4s-Plain;">PUBLIC POLICY ROUTINELY MISIDENTIFIES COMPLEMENTARITIES, SUBSTITUTES, AND INDEPENDENT PAIRS </span></div><div left="76.5" right="537.71" top="321.4"><span x0="76.5" y0="321.4" x1="537.71" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 83.18; y0: 321.4; y1: 332.9; width: 6.68; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Bold;">Vaccine policy in the developed world treats domestic and international action as substitutes, rather than complements, and thus hampers its own effectiveness. </span><span x0="395.51" y0="307.9" x1="537.71" style="x0: 395.51; x1: 401.35; y0: 307.9; y1: 319.4; width: 5.84; font-size: 11.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">The rush to vaccinate ever-less vulnerable populations in developed countries, to hoard purchased vaccines even when regulatory clearance is unlikely or much-delayed, and to purchase boosters before massively scaling up the avail-ability of vaccines in barely vaccinated developing countries suggests that policymakers treat these objectives as substitutes. In fact, they are complements: the susceptibility of a population to COVID-19 depends on both its level of protection and the amount of the virus in circulation. There comes a point&#8212;likely long past in many developed countries&#8212;where inching protection of the population up marginally will have much less effect than reducing the global burden of disease. More generally, as your demand for one (domestic vaccination) increases, so should your demand for the other (vacci- nation in largely unvaccinated places) This will only become more true as countries relax travel re-strictions. Indeed travel restrictions are a second (or third, or fourth) best solution to a policy problem in which the first best solution would have been rapid deployment of vaccines globally. By failing to recognize the complementarity of domestic and international policy, both were undermined.</span></div><div left="76.5" right="535.5" top="103.2"><span x0="76.5" y0="103.2" x1="535.5" style="x0: 76.5; x1: 80.7; y0: 103.2; y1: 112.2; width: 4.2; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: BWUTLP+MrsEavesXLSerifNarOT-Reg;">2 This is, of course, a great simplification, as supporting correspondent banks will have spillover benefits on their ability to en-gage with third countries; meanwhile changing policy at home affects many other countries at once. The point is that the two policies partially achieve the same objective and should be set in reference to each other&#8212;reducing, relative to the assumption of independence, the optimal effort on either. </span></div></body></html>
