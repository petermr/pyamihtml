However plausible this thesis may appear, there are is no statistical evidence to support it, at least as far as international wars are concerned, which are just as often started by democracies as by non-democracies. On the other hand, there is strong empirical support for the thesis that democracy may prevent intra-state conflicts, or rather make the resort to violent means in such conflicts less likely.</span><span x0="375.48" y0="616.86" x1="384.48" style="x0: 375.48; x1: 379.98; y0: 616.86; y1: 625.86; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">86</span></div><div left="70.92" right="77.34" top="592.1"><span x0="70.92" y0="592.1" x1="77.34" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 77.34; y0: 592.1; y1: 606.08; width: 6.42; font-size: 13.98; font-family: MJPKNA+SymbolMT;">&#8226;</span><span x0="88.92" y0="592.14" x1="527.87" style="x0: 88.92; x1: 99.01; y0: 592.14; y1: 606.12; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">According to the (much more prominent) dyadic version, democratic states are very reluctant to go to war against each other, inter alia because they understand each other better due to the more transparent  mode of decision-making. Even though it is often claimed that there is strong empirical evidence to support this thesis, the evidence is actually much more ambiguous  in fact the theory may be either trivial or dubious. Either it rests on a solid empirical foundation, the relevance of which is questionable (as with the numerous analyses based on the behaviour of the Greek city states during the Pelloponesian War in the 5</span><span x0="305.22" y0="470.94" x1="312.24" style="x0: 305.22; x1: 307.72; y0: 470.94; y1: 479.94; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">th</span><span x0="316.38" y0="463.38" x1="392.56" style="x0: 316.38; x1: 325.7; y0: 463.38; y1: 477.36; width: 9.32; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Century BC),</span><span x0="392.52" y0="470.94" x1="401.52" style="x0: 392.52; x1: 397.02; y0: 470.94; y1: 479.94; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">87</span><span x0="405.66" y0="463.38" x1="527.88" style="x0: 405.66; x1: 412.65; y0: 463.38; y1: 477.36; width: 6.99; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">or it rests on a rather narrow empirical basis of  obvious relevance, i.e. stable modern democracies, of which there have been quite few. If the empirical basis is extended to include partial democracies such as the German Empire prior to the First World War in 1914, or Serbia prior to the Kosovo War of 1999, too many exceptions to the general rule appear (in the sense of democracies actually going to war against each other) for the theory to remain unfalsified. If the criteria are tightened for what to count as democracies, the result not only becomes a too narrow empirical basis on which to base a theory. This small population of stable democracies also consists of states which have numerous other reasons not to go to war with each other, making it impossible to determine what role democracy may play. </span><span x0="70.92" y0="269.18" x1="77.34" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 77.34; y0: 269.18; y1: 283.16; width: 6.42; font-size: 13.98; font-family: MJPKNA+SymbolMT;">&#8226;</span><span x0="88.92" y0="269.22" x1="527.88" style="x0: 88.92; x1: 99.01; y0: 269.22; y1: 283.2; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">According to what we may call the &#8220;weak systemic version&#8221;, it is simply possible to generalise or extrapolate from the dyadic to the global level, i.e. that of the system. Considering that the world may be viewed as consisting of dyads of states (Denmark-Norway, France-Uzbekistan, Uruguay-Malawi, etc), the total likelihood of war may presumably be reduced by making as many states (and by implication dyads) as possible democratic. This variant may, however, be criticised for being reductionist, as quite different dynamics and rules may apply at the systemic and the dyadic level&#8212;just as a book is not necessarily well-written, just because all words are spelled correctly and the grammar of each sentence is correct. </span><span x0="70.92" y0="107.18" x1="77.33" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 77.33; y0: 107.18; y1: 121.16; width: 6.42; font-size: 13.98; font-family: MJPKNA+SymbolMT;">&#8226;</span><span x0="88.92" y0="107.22" x1="527.84" style="x0: 88.92; x1: 97.46; y0: 107.22; y1: 121.2; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The strong version of  the systemic variant of the democratic peace theory claims that war may be prevented by means of democracy at the systemic level, i.e. some form of global or cosmopolitan democracy,</span><span x0="421.8" y0="82.56" x1="430.8" style="x0: 421.8; x1: 426.3; y0: 82.56; y1: 91.56; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">88</span><span x0="434.54" y0="75.0" x1="527.94" style="x0: 434.54; x1: 438.43; y0: 75.0; y1: 88.98; width: 3.89; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">terms which are </span></div></body></html>
