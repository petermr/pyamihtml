Now a truce can often be negotiated (perhaps with the involvement of &#8220;third parties&#8221; in the role as mediators) and peacekeeping forces may be deployed to monitor its observance.</span><span x0="208.08" y0="682.26" x1="221.58" style="x0: 208.08; x1: 212.58; y0: 682.26; y1: 691.26; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">113</span><span x0="228.18" y0="674.7" x1="527.92" style="x0: 228.18; x1: 241.38; y0: 674.7; y1: 688.68; width: 13.2; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">While this is fairly unproblematic in international wars and &#8220;traditional&#8221; civil wars between two well-organised parties it is far more complicated in the wars of the third kind described above. Usually, not all parties sign the agreed truce, and there is rarely a generally accepted line of demarcation between the parties, which might be monitored and patrolled by peacekeeping forces.</span><span x0="188.28" y0="601.74" x1="201.78" style="x0: 188.28; x1: 192.78; y0: 601.74; y1: 610.74; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">114</span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.92" top="562.02"><span x0="70.92" y0="562.02" x1="527.92" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 75.58; y0: 562.02; y1: 576.0; width: 4.66; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">If the peace or truce is successfully kept this breathing space may be exploited for actual conflict resolution initiatives (sometimes referred to as &#8220;post-conflict peace-building&#8221;) in order to prevent the conflict from flaring up again upon the departure of the peacekeepers. A central element in such conflict resolution will be dealing with the underlying causes of the conflict, making conflict resolution almost identical with the aforementioned structural conflict prevention, yet with the significant difference that it takes place after a violent conflict and therefore does not suffer from the same justification problems as prevention. Many different measures may recommend themselves for conflict resolution, including political reforms ensuring some power-sharing,</span><span x0="339.3" y0="424.68" x1="352.8" style="x0: 339.3; x1: 343.8; y0: 424.68; y1: 433.68; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">115</span><span x0="357.03" y0="417.12" x1="527.9" style="x0: 357.03; x1: 363.24; y0: 417.12; y1: 431.1; width: 6.21; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">economic measures to reduce inequalities such as land reforms, etc. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="141.31" top="368.64"><span x0="70.92" y0="368.64" x1="141.31" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.01; y0: 368.64; y1: 382.62; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Conclusion </span><span x0="70.92" y0="352.74" x1="527.88" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 352.74; y1: 366.72; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">There are thus numerous ways of preventing, managing and resolving violent conflicts, all with a view to reducing the public evil represented by war and thereby promoting peace as a public good.  </span></div></body></html>
