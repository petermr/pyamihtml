First of all, there is no universal unanimity about what counts as goods, e.g. whether freedom is a good or rather a license for amorality. Secondly, there is no unanimity about the appropriate rank-ordering of good, e.g. about whether to prioritise &#8220;honour&#8221; (in itself a controversial concept) over prosperity. Thirdly, &#8220;goods&#8221; can not merely be defined in positive terms, but also negatively, i.e. as an absence of &#8220;bads&#8221; or evils&#8212;just as health may be defined as an absence of disease and peace as an absence of war (</span><span x0="460.5" y0="594.18" x1="516.28" style="x0: 460.5; x1: 466.71; y0: 594.18; y1: 608.16; width: 6.21; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;">vide infra</span><span x0="516.3" y0="594.18" x1="527.9" style="x0: 516.3; x1: 520.96; y0: 594.18; y1: 608.16; width: 4.66; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">). Public goods may thus be tantamount to either the absence of &#8220;public evils&#8221; (e.g. war, genocide, pollution or climatic changes) or to a general absence of such &#8220;individual evils&#8221; as HIV-AIDS, to which the same rule applies, i.e. that an actor cannot escape them by his own devices. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.84" top="497.58"><span x0="70.92" y0="497.58" x1="527.84" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.01; y0: 497.58; y1: 511.56; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">As we shall see below, the concepts of peace, security and stability are just as ambiguous as that of public goods. Before proceeding to this, however, a brief account of the views about global public goods held by the various theories of international relations seems in order.  </span></div><div left="70.92" right="242.32" top="416.94"><span x0="70.92" y0="416.94" x1="242.32" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 76.36; y0: 416.94; y1: 430.92; width: 5.44; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT;">IR Theories on Public Goods </span><span x0="70.92" y0="401.04" x1="527.88" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 84.12; y0: 401.04; y1: 415.02; width: 13.2; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Within IR (international relations) theory the various schools or &#8220;paradigms&#8221; have different views on the problematique of public goods.  </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.88" top="352.74"><span x0="70.92" y0="352.74" x1="527.88" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 352.74; y1: 366.72; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Liberalism (previously known as idealism) holds a generally optimistic view on the problem, thereby exposing itself to the critique (on the part of &#8220;realists&#8221;) for being utopian.</span><span x0="151.14" y0="328.08" x1="155.64" style="x0: 151.14; x1: 155.64; y0: 328.08; y1: 337.08; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">7</span><span x0="159.3" y0="320.52" x1="527.9" style="x0: 159.3; x1: 169.39; y0: 320.52; y1: 334.5; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">As the production of a public good (e.g. peace) will benefit all, it will also take place, either because decision-makers will be persuaded of the need to do so, or almost automatically, e.g. by means of Adam Smith&#8217;s &#8220;invisible hand&#8221;, working through the market mechanisms.</span><span x0="402.18" y0="279.78" x1="406.68" style="x0: 402.18; x1: 406.68; y0: 279.78; y1: 288.78; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">8</span></div><div left="99.3" right="527.68" top="243.45"><span x0="99.3" y0="243.45" x1="527.68" style="x0: 99.3; x1: 107.26; y0: 243.45; y1: 256.47; width: 7.96; font-size: 13.02; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Every individual ... generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.91" top="138.84"><span x0="70.92" y0="138.84" x1="527.91" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.01; y0: 138.84; y1: 152.82; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">As a means to ensure the good will of decision-makers, some liberalists have envisioned a global democracy of sorts, basing themselves on the belief that if only decisions are taken democratically they will automatically reflect the real interests of the majority which will invariably be to maximise the public good.</span><span x0="510.72" y0="98.1" x1="515.22" style="x0: 510.72; x1: 515.22; y0: 98.1; y1: 107.1; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">9</span></div></body></html>
