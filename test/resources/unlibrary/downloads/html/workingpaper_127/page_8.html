Its unifying theme has been the notion of &#8220;international society&#8221;, i.e. the conception of the world as a society, constituted as such by a modicum of shared values and norms&#8212;even though this society remains anarchical, i.e. without any supranational authority comparable to the state in national societies.</span><span x0="320.16" y0="569.58" x1="329.16" style="x0: 320.16; x1: 324.66; y0: 569.58; y1: 578.58; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">31</span><span x0="332.94" y0="562.02" x1="527.86" style="x0: 332.94; x1: 346.14; y0: 562.02; y1: 576.0; width: 13.2; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">While the &#8220;solidarists&#8221; within this school resemble liberalist with their emphasis on international law and justice, its &#8220;pluralists&#8221; are closer to the views of realists with their emphasis on the sovereign rights of states, i.e. &#8220;order&#8221;.</span><span x0="289.26" y0="521.28" x1="298.26" style="x0: 289.26; x1: 293.76; y0: 521.28; y1: 530.28; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">32</span><span x0="302.88" y0="513.72" x1="527.81" style="x0: 302.88; x1: 311.42; y0: 513.72; y1: 527.7; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The basic tenets of the English School are easily compatible with theories of public goods, if only because the &#8220;order&#8221; of the anarchical society described by Hedley Bull constitutes a public good. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="305.08" top="449.1"><span x0="70.92" y0="449.1" x1="305.08" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.01; y0: 449.1; y1: 463.08; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Are Peace and Stability Public Goods? </span><span x0="70.92" y0="433.2" x1="527.98" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 80.25; y0: 433.2; y1: 447.18; width: 9.32; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Before proceeding with the analysis of whether or how peace and stability may be viewed as public goods, the concepts need to be defined which is more controversial than one might assume. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="528.0" top="368.82"><span x0="70.92" y0="368.82" x1="528.0" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 368.82; y1: 382.8; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The Norwegian peace researcher Johan Galtung distinguishes between &#8220;positive&#8221; and &#8220;negative peace&#8221;, of which the latter refers to a simple absence of &#8220;direct violence&#8221; (e.g. war) whereas the former is more comprehensive and diffuse. Positive peace may be defined as an absence of not merely direct violence, but also &#8220;structural violence&#8221;, in turn defined as a &#8220;relative deprivation&#8221; of values.</span><span x0="200.16" y0="295.86" x1="209.16" style="x0: 200.16; x1: 204.66; y0: 295.86; y1: 304.86; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">33</span><span x0="213.3" y0="288.3" x1="527.85" style="x0: 213.3; x1: 217.95; y0: 288.3; y1: 302.28; width: 4.66; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">In the latter sense, peace is thus incompatible with, for instance, oppression, extreme inequality, etc. This does, however, make the concept almost all-encompassing, thus detracting from its analytical value. In the following I shall therefore focus on negative peace in the narrow sense of an absence of wars and other major conflicts. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.88" top="191.7"><span x0="70.92" y0="191.7" x1="527.88" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 78.69; y0: 191.7; y1: 205.68; width: 7.77; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">From this analytical point of departure it soon becomes obvious that peace thus understood does not imply stability in a wider sense. On the contrary, the absence of open war may even presuppose a profound instability such as that represented by an almost even balance of power.</span><span x0="353.7" y0="151.02" x1="362.7" style="x0: 353.7; x1: 358.2; y0: 151.02; y1: 160.02; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">34</span><span x0="367.61" y0="143.46" x1="527.85" style="x0: 367.61; x1: 372.26; y0: 143.46; y1: 157.44; width: 4.66; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">It is even possible to argue that peace is built on instability, as was indeed the official policy of the United States and NATO throughout the Cold War, where the philosophy was that it was exactly the unpredictability of the military balance which secured the peace.
