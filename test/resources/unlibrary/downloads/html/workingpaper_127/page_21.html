This controversy is closely related to the aforementioned one between neorealists and neoliberal institutionalists (s&#230;tningsopbygning??), where the former represent the first point of view and the latter the second. The answer to these question may well be either/or, as some organisations, even though they may have been created by great powers as their instruments, may gradually develop their own identities and play partly independent roles, at least in areas which none of the stronger member states regard as &#8220;vital issues&#8221;. They may thus gradually build capacities (provided by member states) for independent action. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.85" top="320.46"><span x0="70.92" y0="320.46" x1="527.85" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.01; y0: 320.46; y1: 334.44; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Another category of potential actors are the states which are, however, also parts of the problem. A useful distinction may be between states which are directly involved and others. Most of the following considerations, however, also apply to the parties to the above-mentioned wars of the third kind, i.e. to both states and rebel movements if only the latter are relatively organised.  </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.87" top="223.86"><span x0="70.92" y0="223.86" x1="527.87" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 223.86; y1: 237.84; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Even though the states involved have, on the one hand (usually, albeit not always) an interest in avoiding war, they have an equally obvious interest in not losing it, should it nevertheless occur, and these two sets of considerations may well point in opposite directions. The latter interest may call for an arms build-up before the war as well as for an escalation after it has begun, which may well make the very outbreak of war more likely and increase the destructiveness of the ensuing war. It is thus highly significant how the two sets of interests are prioritised.  </span></div></body></html>
