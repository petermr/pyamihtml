As far as developing countries are concerned, development aid may be used as a means to this end, as many donors have indeed come to realise.</span><span x0="393.12" y0="730.56" x1="406.62" style="x0: 393.12; x1: 397.62; y0: 730.56; y1: 739.56; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">108</span><span x0="412.44" y0="723.0" x1="527.88" style="x0: 412.44; x1: 420.98; y0: 723.0; y1: 736.98; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The codification of rules may also contribute to structural prevention, both as far as general rules (e.g. in international law) and more concrete ones (such as arms control agreements) are concerned.</span><span x0="224.4" y0="682.26" x1="237.9" style="x0: 224.4; x1: 228.9; y0: 682.26; y1: 691.26; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">109</span></div><div left="70.92" right="528.0" top="642.48"><span x0="70.92" y0="642.48" x1="528.0" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.01; y0: 642.48; y1: 656.46; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Operational conflict prevention is about preventing an immediately impending conflict outbreak, and here most attention has been devoted to the need for early warning as a background for preventative action. Unfortunately, both are hampered by serious complications. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.89" top="562.02"><span x0="70.92" y0="562.02" x1="527.89" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.01; y0: 562.02; y1: 576.0; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">As far as early warning is concerned, the requisite data are often missing. Even if data are available, even the best ones lend themselves to divergent interpretations.</span><span x0="155.28" y0="537.36" x1="168.78" style="x0: 155.28; x1: 159.78; y0: 537.36; y1: 546.36; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">110</span><span x0="176.34" y0="529.8" x1="527.94" style="x0: 176.34; x1: 188.77; y0: 529.8; y1: 543.78; width: 12.43; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Moreover, even if the relevant decision-makers reach the conclusion that a conflict is impending, they will have to make sure that they will be able to subsequently substantiate this assessment. This will, ironically, become the more difficult the most successful potential preventative initiatives will be. If they succeed 100 percent, the result will be that nothing happens, and it will be very difficult to prove what would have occurred in the absence of the preventative measure. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.97" top="401.04"><span x0="70.92" y0="401.04" x1="527.97" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 401.04; y1: 415.02; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">This may not be an insurmountable problem as long as merely &#8220;soft&#8221; instruments are employed such as support for civil society organisations, mediation efforts and the like, but it will be a serious obstacle to more &#8220;muscular&#8221; measures such as economic sanctions</span><span x0="354.3" y0="360.3" x1="367.8" style="x0: 354.3; x1: 358.8; y0: 360.3; y1: 369.3; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">111</span><span x0="372.53" y0="352.74" x1="527.94" style="x0: 372.53; x1: 379.52; y0: 352.74; y1: 366.72; width: 6.99; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">or (even more so) military intervention. Considering that &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; economic sanctions typically hurt the innocent the most, recent years have seen a growing interest in the development of &#8220;smart&#8221; sanctions which specifically affect the guilty ones, typically state leaders.</span><span x0="205.44" y0="295.86" x1="218.94" style="x0: 205.44; x1: 209.94; y0: 295.86; y1: 304.86; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">112</span><span x0="227.33" y0="288.3" x1="527.96" style="x0: 227.33; x1: 231.99; y0: 288.3; y1: 302.28; width: 4.66; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">If panoply of such smart sanctions is available, preventative actions will be far less problematic to undertake. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.86" top="240.0"><span x0="70.92" y0="240.0" x1="527.86" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 84.12; y0: 240.0; y1: 253.98; width: 13.2; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">When a conflict has erupted in violent struggle (be that in the form of an international or a civil war) soft instruments will often be ineffective. There may, however, still remain some scope for mediation initiatives, just as sanctions may be imposed on one or both parties to an armed conflict, usually in the form of an arms embargo. Even though it will now be easier to justify some form of engagement (as the problem is now obvious) the costs of interference by military means have also risen. In a civil war situation it will often require the deployment of armed forces mandated to enforce a truce, which may often entail actual combat operations and may cost lives. In the case of non-vital interests such as civil wars in foreign countries, most countries (and not least democracies) have a very low tolerance for casualties. </span></div></body></html>
