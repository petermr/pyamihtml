Does global democracy mean that all states should have the same influence, or that all citizens should? The logical implications of the former would be that China with its 1.3 billion inhabitants should only have the same influence as, say, Denmark with around five million, whereas the latter would mean that China should have four times as much power as the United States and 250 times as much as Denmark. A combination of the two may also be possible, e.g. in a bicameral system in which one chamber represents the states and the other the peoples. But is it likely that the West would relinquish power to the extent implied by such a system? And does global democracy not presuppose that all the component parts, i.e. the states, are democratic, as it surely cannot be taken for granted that government of non-democracies always speak and vote on behalf of their citizens. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="353.98" top="529.62"><span x0="70.92" y0="529.62" x1="353.98" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 529.62; y1: 543.6; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Peace as a Public Good: The &#8220;Peace Dividend&#8221; </span><span x0="70.92" y0="513.72" x1="527.83" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 75.57; y0: 513.72; y1: 527.7; width: 4.66; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">If peace is a public evil it almost logically follows that peace must be a public good, either for the individual state or for world society as a whole. In this sense, the public goods aspects of peace are sometimes referred to as the &#8220;peace dividend&#8221;.</span><span x0="129.6" y0="472.98" x1="138.6" style="x0: 129.6; x1: 134.1; y0: 472.98; y1: 481.98; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">89</span><span x0="145.19" y0="465.42" x1="515.46" style="x0: 145.19; x1: 153.73; y0: 465.42; y1: 479.4; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Even though this dividend may assume many different forms,</span><span x0="515.4" y0="472.98" x1="524.4" style="x0: 515.4; x1: 519.9; y0: 472.98; y1: 481.98; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">90</span></div><div left="70.92" right="377.31" top="449.28"><span x0="70.92" y0="449.28" x1="377.31" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.8; y0: 449.28; y1: 463.26; width: 10.88; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">most attention has been given to its economic aspects. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.96" top="417.12"><span x0="70.92" y0="417.12" x1="527.96" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 84.12; y0: 417.12; y1: 431.1; width: 13.2; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">War and the preparations for war simply cost money which may be saved in the case of peace and, even more so, as a consequence of expectations of a lasting peace, making preparations for war superfluous or, at least, less urgent. How this peace dividend may be &#8220;cashed in&#8221; via arms reduction or disarmament, however, is more complicated, just as measuring the peace dividend is difficult. Apart from what is measurable, of course, non-economic benefits of expending societal resources on something useful also need to be considered. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.92" top="288.3"><span x0="70.92" y0="288.3" x1="527.92" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 75.57; y0: 288.3; y1: 302.28; width: 4.66; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">It is certainly possible to approach these matters from a macro-economic perspective, taking national account figures of defence expenditures as the point of departure and combining this with the multiplier to assess the indirect consequences.</span><span x0="151.38" y0="247.56" x1="160.38" style="x0: 151.38; x1: 155.88; y0: 247.56; y1: 256.56; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">91</span><span x0="169.02" y0="240.0" x1="527.89" style="x0: 169.02; x1: 179.11; y0: 240.0; y1: 253.98; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">As far as the salary part of defence expenditures is concerned, it will have to take into account the rate of employment, determining whether former military staff can be employed in the civilian sectors of the economy or whether they will end up on the dole or in early retirement; the difference between former salaries and future pensions or unemployment benefits (as well as potential &#8220;golden handshakes&#8221;); the share of income and consumer taxes of this difference; the savings and import rates of disposable income; and the demand implications of the anticipated decline in income for the affected personnel. </span></div></body></html>
