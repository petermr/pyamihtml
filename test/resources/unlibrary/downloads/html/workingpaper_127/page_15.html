There is no automatic correspondence between humanitarian motives and consequences, and it is perfectly conceivable that interventions spurred by humanitarian concerns may exacerbate the humanitarian problems&#8212;or indeed that interventions undertaken for other reasons may lead to a clear improvement of the humanitarian situation. Whereas the US (but UN-authorised) intervention in Somalia probably belongs to the former category, Vietnam&#8217;s intervention in Cambodia may belong to the latter, as it removed from power one of the most genocidal regimes the world has ever known.</span><span x0="112.5" y0="601.74" x1="121.5" style="x0: 112.5; x1: 117.0; y0: 601.74; y1: 610.74; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">72</span></div><div left="70.92" right="149.46" top="561.84"><span x0="70.92" y0="561.84" x1="149.46" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 76.36; y0: 561.84; y1: 575.82; width: 5.44; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT;">Indirect evils </span><span x0="70.92" y0="545.88" x1="527.9" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 83.35; y0: 545.88; y1: 559.86; width: 12.43; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Many of the above-mentioned wars have wide-ranging side-effects, almost all of which deserve the label of public evils.
