The longer the &#8220;shadow of the future&#8221;, the greater importance the two parties will attach to the continuous collaboration and by implication the absolute gains (including the public goods) which this may produce, in comparison to the relative gains which they might be able to &#8220;cash in&#8221; in the &#8220;last round&#8221;. If the possibility of such a last round before the final battle is not assessed as high a far-reaching cooperation may well turn out to be the rational choice.</span><span x0="230.28" y0="650.04" x1="239.28" style="x0: 230.28; x1: 234.78; y0: 650.04; y1: 659.04; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">21</span></div><div left="70.92" right="515.35" top="610.32"><span x0="70.92" y0="610.32" x1="515.35" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 610.32; y1: 624.3; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">To the same category of theories might be counted that of &#8220;common security&#8221;,</span><span x0="515.4" y0="617.88" x1="524.4" style="x0: 515.4; x1: 519.9; y0: 617.88; y1: 626.88; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">22</span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.81" top="594.18"><span x0="70.92" y0="594.18" x1="527.81" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.01; y0: 594.18; y1: 608.16; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">which appeared in the 1980s.

By devising strategies and force structures which maximise the defensive while minimising offensive strength, however, it might be possible to achieve security without doing so at the other side&#8217;s expense&#8212;and two opponents could thus simultaneously improve their national security.   </span></div><div left="70.92" right="416.59" top="417.12"><span x0="70.92" y0="417.12" x1="416.59" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 80.24; y0: 417.12; y1: 431.1; width: 9.32; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Certain IR analysts, including realists such as Robert Gilpin,</span><span x0="416.52" y0="424.68" x1="425.52" style="x0: 416.52; x1: 421.02; y0: 424.68; y1: 433.68; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">24</span><span x0="429.84" y0="417.12" x1="527.91" style="x0: 429.84; x1: 436.83; y0: 417.12; y1: 431.1; width: 6.99; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">have highlighted the fact that special rules seem to apply to the largest members of a system. For them there may actually be a direct correlation between consumption and production of public goods simply because their share of total production is so large that it has noticeable implications for what is available for consumption. Hence, the very largest members not only have the leverage to punish free-riding, but also an obvious incentive to do so and achieve a fair distribution of the production. This has made various IR scholars point to hegemony (a concept of Greek origins, but usually associated with the political thinking of Antonio Gramsci)</span><span x0="123.0" y0="279.78" x1="132.0" style="x0: 123.0; x1: 127.5; y0: 279.78; y1: 288.78; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">25</span><span x0="136.42" y0="272.22" x1="387.8" style="x0: 136.42; x1: 142.63; y0: 272.22; y1: 286.2; width: 6.21; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">as the solution to the public goods problem.</span><span x0="387.9" y0="279.78" x1="396.9" style="x0: 387.9; x1: 392.4; y0: 279.78; y1: 288.78; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">26</span><span x0="401.34" y0="272.22" x1="527.83" style="x0: 401.34; x1: 409.88; y0: 272.22; y1: 286.2; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The preconditions for such hegemony were to a certain extent present within the two opposing alliances during the Cold War, just as they were within the international monetary system as long as the US dollar remained the universal reserve currency.</span><span x0="123.36" y0="215.4" x1="132.36" style="x0: 123.36; x1: 127.86; y0: 215.4; y1: 224.4; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">27</span><span x0="136.2" y0="207.84" x1="527.95" style="x0: 136.2; x1: 144.74; y0: 207.84; y1: 221.82; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The preconditions of hegemony may also be present on a regional or subregional level where one state often surpasses all the rest in terms of the relevant elements of power, as seems to be the case of South  Africa in Southern Africa and of Nigeria in West Africa.</span><span x0="280.44" y0="167.1" x1="289.44" style="x0: 280.44; x1: 284.94; y0: 167.1; y1: 176.1; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">28</span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.91" top="127.32"><span x0="70.92" y0="127.32" x1="527.91" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 80.24; y0: 127.32; y1: 141.3; width: 9.32; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Regime theories may be combined with such &#8220;hegemonic stability&#8221; theories.
