Nor is it self-evident&#8212;the positive connotations of the concept notwithstanding&#8212;that stability is a good at all, as the concept signifies a preservation of a status quo which is not automatically beneficial to all parties. Stability may thus (just as negative peace) be opposed to the demand for justice, e.g. in the sense of &#8220;distributive justice&#8221;,</span><span x0="314.34" y0="585.66" x1="323.34" style="x0: 314.34; x1: 318.84; y0: 585.66; y1: 594.66; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">37</span><span x0="329.52" y0="578.1" x1="527.92" style="x0: 329.52; x1: 339.61; y0: 578.1; y1: 592.08; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">which also entails a reduction of inequalities, at least with regard to options. As mentioned above, inequality was a central element in Galtung&#8217;s concept of structural violence, which means that its elimination or reduction is a precondition of his &#8220;positive peace&#8221;. On the other hand, its abolition may occasionally require the use of direct violence, i.e. a breach of the negative peace. The victims of structural violence may thus have the right to (or at least feel entitled to) resort to direct violence, i.e. to violate the negative peace in order to secure positive peace by removing structural violence.</span><span x0="121.86" y0="456.84" x1="130.86" style="x0: 121.86; x1: 126.36; y0: 456.84; y1: 465.84; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">38</span><span x0="135.0" y0="449.28" x1="527.89" style="x0: 135.0; x1: 148.2; y0: 449.28; y1: 463.26; width: 13.2; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">We have seen this in a long chain of revolutions, beginning with the American and French revolutions in the 18</span><span x0="316.56" y0="440.76" x1="323.58" style="x0: 316.56; x1: 319.06; y0: 440.76; y1: 449.76; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">th</span><span x0="327.95" y0="433.2" x1="527.93" style="x0: 327.95; x1: 337.27; y0: 433.2; y1: 447.18; width: 9.32; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Century and continuing in modern wars of liberation&#8212;some of which have even seen a resort to means which some would label terrorism. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.82" top="368.82"><span x0="70.92" y0="368.82" x1="527.82" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 75.57; y0: 368.82; y1: 382.8; width: 4.66; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">It is thus far from self-evident that negative peace in the narrow sense is necessarily a good, much less a public good. To thus deny that peace is an unconditional good may appear heretical as the concept has at least as posive ?? connotations as &#8220;stability&#8221;. On the other hand, only radical principled pacifists would deny that certain wars may be just and good, hence that certain types of peace may be bad. If the UK had not declared war on Germany in 1939, the Nazis might perhaps have undertaken the Holocaust with impunity as well as have conquered most of Europe, including Denmark&#8212;which would surely have been a most unappealing negative peace. It must also be acknowledged that a war is always, in a certain sense, caused by the defender who always has the option of simply surrendering without resistance, thus avoiding a war&#8212;as Denmark did on the 9</span><span x0="193.62" y0="199.26" x1="200.64" style="x0: 193.62; x1: 196.12; y0: 199.26; y1: 208.26; width: 2.5; font-size: 9.0; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">th</span><span x0="204.23" y0="191.7" x1="527.84" style="x0: 204.23; x1: 211.22; y0: 191.7; y1: 205.68; width: 6.99; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">of April 1940.
