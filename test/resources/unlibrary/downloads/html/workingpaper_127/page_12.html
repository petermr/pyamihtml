To this unquestionable public &#8220;super-evil&#8221; were added other side-effects such as radio-active contamination as a result of atmospheric nuclear tests (until the entry into force of the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963) as well as, of course, the economic costs of the nuclear arms race.</span><span x0="242.64" y0="456.84" x1="251.64" style="x0: 242.64; x1: 247.14; y0: 456.84; y1: 465.84; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">52</span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.96" top="417.12"><span x0="70.92" y0="417.12" x1="527.96" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 75.58; y0: 417.12; y1: 431.1; width: 4.66; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">It may nevertheless be disputed that nuclear deterrence as such was a public evil. No nuclear weapons were ever used, and the upkeep of the nuclear arsenals may still have been cheaper than it would have been to deter the respective opponent by means of conventional forces. An argument can also be made to the effect that nuclear deterrence was the main reason for &#8220;the long peace&#8221; experienced by Europe,</span><span x0="114.84" y0="344.16" x1="123.84" style="x0: 114.84; x1: 119.34; y0: 344.16; y1: 353.16; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">53</span><span x0="127.98" y0="336.6" x1="527.94" style="x0: 127.98; x1: 138.07; y0: 336.6; y1: 350.58; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">which was undoubtedly a collective good of sorts as it did not merely include the members of the two alliances, but also neutral states. It would, however, be a logical fallacy to deduce from the fact that deterrence did not fail to its having been required in the first place. As pointed out by John Mueller and others, many alternative explanations of the long peace recommend themselves.</span><span x0="136.62" y0="263.7" x1="145.62" style="x0: 136.62; x1: 141.12; y0: 263.7; y1: 272.7; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">54</span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.9" top="223.92"><span x0="70.92" y0="223.92" x1="527.9" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.01; y0: 223.92; y1: 237.9; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">On the other hand, it is impossible to disprove that nuclear weapons were a major cause pf the long peace. It  seems plausible (albeit impossible to prove) that nuclear weapons have had a general deterrent effect, i.e. that one side&#8217;s nuclear weapons have not merely deterred the respective other from a nuclear attack, but that the &#8220;existential deterrence&#8221; (a term coined by McGeorge Bundy) worked at all levels.</span><span x0="185.46" y0="151.02" x1="194.46" style="x0: 185.46; x1: 189.96; y0: 151.02; y1: 160.02; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">55</span><span x0="198.6" y0="143.46" x1="527.96" style="x0: 198.6; x1: 206.37; y0: 143.46; y1: 157.44; width: 7.77; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Precisely because the arsenals and their deployment were designed to safeguard the ability to retaliate under all circumstances, they entailed a certain risk of being triggered by mistake&#8212;e.g. as a result of a misinterpretation of warning indicators, because of a technical error, or via a &#8220;Dr. Strangelove scenario&#8221;, starting with a human error and then producing a </span></div></body></html>
