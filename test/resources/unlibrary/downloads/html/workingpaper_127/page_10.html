Indeed, this is the reason why most states field a defence force and/or join alliances, i.e. in order to deter attacks from other states. Alliance membership automatically entails a certain contribution to the production of the common good, as the very membership is tantamount to choosing sides, thereby running the risk of becoming involved in a war of which a state might otherwise stay aloof.</span><span x0="264.84" y0="650.04" x1="273.84" style="x0: 264.84; x1: 269.34; y0: 650.04; y1: 659.04; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">40</span><span x0="277.87" y0="642.48" x1="527.94" style="x0: 277.87; x1: 287.96; y0: 642.48; y1: 656.46; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">On top of that normally comes, for obvious reasons, some pressure from the other alliance members to make a military contribution to the joint defence or deterrence.   </span></div><div left="70.92" right="193.39" top="577.92"><span x0="70.92" y0="577.92" x1="193.39" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 84.9; y0: 577.92; y1: 591.9; width: 13.98; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">War as a public evil </span><span x0="70.92" y0="562.02" x1="527.92" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.01; y0: 562.02; y1: 576.0; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">All the above qualifications notwithstanding, there can be no disputing that wars are generally phenomena deserving the label &#8220;public evils&#8221; in the sense of evils afflicting everyone, either directly or indirectly&#8212;in the latter case either because of the side-effects of an actual war or of the preparations for a possible war.</span><span x0="515.4" y0="521.28" x1="524.4" style="x0: 515.4; x1: 519.9; y0: 521.28; y1: 530.28; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">41</span></div><div left="70.92" right="322.0" top="497.58"><span x0="70.92" y0="497.58" x1="322.0" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.01; y0: 497.58; y1: 511.56; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">However, wars do differ also in this respect. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="151.44" top="465.24"><span x0="70.92" y0="465.24" x1="151.44" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 465.24; y1: 479.22; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT;">Types of War </span><span x0="70.92" y0="449.28" x1="527.82" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 75.57; y0: 449.28; y1: 463.26; width: 4.66; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">In the following we shall proceed from a (perhaps excessively) simple categorisation of wars into pre-modern, modern, nuclear and &#8220;wars of the third kind&#8221;&#8212;a classification which builds on history, but nevertheless is not strictly historical as pre-modern wars may also occur in this day and age.  </span></div><div left="70.92" right="177.46" top="368.64"><span x0="70.92" y0="368.64" x1="177.46" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 368.64; y1: 382.62; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT;">Pre-modern Wars </span><span x0="70.92" y0="352.74" x1="527.89" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 83.35; y0: 352.74; y1: 366.72; width: 12.43; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Medieval and even earlier wars were typically waged by a wide range of actors, including the monarchy, the church, feudal lords, etc.&#8212;in most cases mainly by means of professionals, i.e. mercenaries.</span><span x0="300.18" y0="328.08" x1="309.18" style="x0: 300.18; x1: 304.68; y0: 328.08; y1: 337.08; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">42</span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.91" top="288.3"><span x0="70.92" y0="288.3" x1="527.91" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 78.69; y0: 288.3; y1: 302.28; width: 7.77; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">For this reasons as well as because of the scarcity of means to rent and/or arm and equip armies inter alia because of inadequate capacity to tax the population) wars were usually rather limited, the opposing armies manoeuvring rather than fighting and often doing so in order to avoid encountering the adversary  than to force him into battle. When actual fighting nevertheless took place, it was almost exclusively directed against the soldiers of the respective opponent. Of course there were civilian victims and suffering in such wars, e.g. in the form of looting and sporadic violence, including rape, by the soldiers, but these effects were rather limited and far from indivisible as they could be escaped from. However, in parallel with the growth of populations it became more difficult to flee (at least permanently) which invested the effects of war with a public evil character. As argued by Jeffrey Herbst, however, this trend was largely confined to Europe, whereas escape remained an option in most of Africa because of its low population density.</span><span x0="202.74" y0="86.58" x1="211.74" style="x0: 202.74; x1: 207.24; y0: 86.58; y1: 95.58; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">43</span></div></body></html>
