This made it less urgent to guard against losing and generated an interest in disarmament and international cooperation, i.e. in the provision of public goods. In conformity with this amended set of priorities, the Soviet leadership around Gorbachev thus suddenly took the debate on &#8220;global problems&#8221; (e.g. related to the environment) seriously and accepted a share of responsibility for their solution, which it had previously refused.</span><span x0="115.62" y0="633.96" x1="129.12" style="x0: 115.62; x1: 120.12; y0: 633.96; y1: 642.96; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">100</span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.9" top="594.18"><span x0="70.92" y0="594.18" x1="527.9" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 594.18; y1: 608.16; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The reverse may, of course, also be true, i.e. that a party to a conflict comes to realise that it cannot win, which gives it an obvious incentive to bring the conflict to a halt on the best obtainable terms, often couched in terms of a truce and a subsequent peace treaty. It is even possible that both sides may reach such a conclusion simultaneously, but unfortunately this does not automatically lead to peace.  Sometimes a continuation of the war may still appear to decision-makers as the lesser evil, as they would otherwise have to justify the &#8220;sunk costs&#8221; which the war has already brought about, both economically and in terms of human lives. Moreover, the very state of war can have its attractions, and decision-makers may further be concerned about their international reputation, which may be decisive for their position of power in the longer run. A state which has to surrender almost invites attacks in the future or to have its vital interests infringed upon by others at a later stage,</span><span x0="346.74" y0="408.6" x1="360.24" style="x0: 346.74; x1: 351.24; y0: 408.6; y1: 417.6; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">101</span><span x0="363.77" y0="401.04" x1="527.96" style="x0: 363.77; x1: 369.98; y0: 401.04; y1: 415.02; width: 6.21; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">at least unless it allows itself to be protected by others, as was the case of post-war Germany and Japan.  </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.9" top="352.74"><span x0="70.92" y0="352.74" x1="527.9" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 78.69; y0: 352.74; y1: 366.72; width: 7.77; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Sooner or later, however, what William Zartmann has aptly called a &#8220;hurting stalemate&#8221; usually develops, i.e. a situation where both sides realise that neither one can prevail, but where this stalemate also hurts, which gives both sides an incentives ?? to sue for peace.</span><span x0="239.28" y0="312.0" x1="252.78" style="x0: 239.28; x1: 243.78; y0: 312.0; y1: 321.0; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">102</span><span x0="256.38" y0="304.44" x1="527.94" style="x0: 256.38; x1: 264.93; y0: 304.44; y1: 318.42; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The same may be the case in a cold war such as the East-West conflict where the arms race imposed burdens on both sides, but especially on the USSR as the weaker side, which it was unable to shoulder in the long run. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.92" top="223.92"><span x0="70.92" y0="223.92" x1="527.92" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 223.92; y1: 237.9; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">External powers may also play a role in such conflicts, either between states or between states and rebel movements.</span><span x0="283.14" y0="215.4" x1="296.64" style="x0: 283.14; x1: 287.64; y0: 215.4; y1: 224.4; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">103</span><span x0="301.19" y0="207.84" x1="527.91" style="x0: 301.19; x1: 305.85; y0: 207.84; y1: 221.82; width: 4.66; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">In some cases they may be affected by the conflict (e.g. as host countries for war refugees), providing them with a clear self-interest in bringing the conflict to a halt. In other situations, their international role may almost demand involvement. A global or regional hegemony that does not interfere in a serious conflict within its sphere of influence risks loosing part of its acceptance as hegemony. Finally, there are certainly states (to which Denmark has traditionally belonged) which simply take their international (legal or moral) obligations seriously.   </span></div></body></html>
