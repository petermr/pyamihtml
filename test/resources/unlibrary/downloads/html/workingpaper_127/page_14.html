Some of the wars which are here counted as international (e.g. in the Balkans) are even wars of secession which have merely been labelled international as a consequence of a (more or less unanimous, but almost always arbitrary) international recognition of the secessionist parts, whereas other wars of secession have been categorised as intra-state, either because the secessionist movements have not achieved international recognition or because they have lost (or perhaps not yet won) the war in question, as is, for instance, the case of the war in southern Sudan.</span><span x0="220.62" y0="360.3" x1="229.62" style="x0: 220.62; x1: 225.12; y0: 360.3; y1: 369.3; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">68</span></div><div left="72.66" right="242.56" top="325.67"><span x0="72.66" y0="325.67" x1="242.56" style="x0: 72.66; x1: 79.98; y0: 325.67; y1: 336.65; width: 7.32; font-size: 10.98; fill: 1; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Table 1: Armed Conflicts 1989-2002</span><span x0="242.52" y0="331.14" x1="249.0" style="x0: 242.52; x1: 245.76; y0: 331.14; y1: 337.62; width: 3.24; font-size: 6.48; fill: 1; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">69</span></div><div left="72.66" right="523.42" top="313.64"><span x0="72.66" y0="313.64" x1="523.42" style="x0: 72.66; x1: 79.89; y0: 313.64; y1: 323.66; width: 7.23; font-size: 10.02; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Category 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 19961997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Intra-state </span><span x0="126.66" y0="301.76" x1="513.47" style="x0: 126.66; x1: 131.67; y0: 301.76; y1: 311.78; width: 5.01; font-size: 10.02; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">43 45 52 51 42 42 33 33 30 31 29 28 29 26 </span><span x0="72.66" y0="289.64" x1="117.16" style="x0: 72.66; x1: 79.34; y0: 289.64; y1: 299.66; width: 6.68; font-size: 10.02; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Transnat. </span><span x0="126.66" y0="289.76" x1="508.43" style="x0: 126.66; x1: 131.67; y0: 289.76; y1: 299.78; width: 5.01; font-size: 10.02; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">2 2 1 2 5 1 1 1 3 5 6 4 5 4 </span><span x0="72.66" y0="277.64" x1="113.28" style="x0: 72.66; x1: 76.56; y0: 277.64; y1: 287.66; width: 3.9; font-size: 10.02; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">Internat. </span><span x0="126.66" y0="277.76" x1="508.43" style="x0: 126.66; x1: 131.67; y0: 277.76; y1: 287.78; width: 5.01; font-size: 10.02; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">3 3 1 1 0 0 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.85" top="247.38"><span x0="70.92" y0="247.38" x1="527.85" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 81.01; y0: 247.38; y1: 261.36; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">A few of the international wars belong to the classical type, which was (to some extent, at least) the case of the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 1998 to 2000,</span><span x0="102.42" y0="222.72" x1="111.42" style="x0: 102.42; x1: 106.92; y0: 222.72; y1: 231.72; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">70</span><span x0="116.95" y0="215.16" x1="527.97" style="x0: 116.95; x1: 127.05; y0: 215.16; y1: 229.14; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">whereas others are more appropriately called &#8220;interventions&#8221;.
