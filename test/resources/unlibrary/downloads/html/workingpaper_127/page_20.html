If a peace is signed after a protracted civil war a large part of both government forces and former insurgents need to be disarmed and demobilised. It the former soldiers and/or guerrillas are not provided with alternative employment and integrated into civilian society, experience shows that they will often resort to arms again, either through a renewed rebellion or in criminal activities, thereby  benefiting from their skills in the use of weapons. Considering that societies such as these are often in a desperate economic situation caused by a protracted armed conflict, there is usually a need for foreign aid for such &#8220;DDR&amp;R&#8221;-programmes (for disarmament, demobilisation, repatriation and reintegration).</span><span x0="260.04" y0="553.44" x1="269.04" style="x0: 260.04; x1: 264.54; y0: 553.44; y1: 562.44; width: 4.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 1]; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">99</span><span x0="281.4" y0="545.88" x1="524.37" style="x0: 281.4; x1: 291.49; y0: 545.88; y1: 559.86; width: 10.09; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">A successfully implemented DDR&amp;R-programme would warrant the label of a public good as it may be a precondition for preventing a conflict from flaring up again which may easily affect an entire region.   </span></div><div left="70.92" right="315.03" top="465.24"><span x0="70.92" y0="465.24" x1="315.03" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 80.24; y0: 465.24; y1: 479.22; width: 9.32; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT;">The Provision of Peace as a Public Good </span><span x0="70.92" y0="449.28" x1="527.96" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 75.57; y0: 449.28; y1: 463.26; width: 4.66; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">In principle there are many ways to create the public good, not least by limiting the public evil represented by wars and preparations for them. It stands to reason that different types of measures will be called for to prevent different kinds of wars, to bring different forms of raging armed conflicts to a halt and thus to make the preparations for them superfluous. There are no instruments or strategies of universal applicability but rather a need for a well-stuffed &#8220;tool box&#8221; and a broad panoply of strategies and skills. Likewise, the involvement of a wide variety of categories of actors may prove relevant. </span></div><div left="70.92" right="527.84" top="304.44"><span x0="70.92" y0="304.44" x1="527.84" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 304.44; y1: 318.42; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The scope of the present article does not allow for anything like an exhaustive account of these issues, and will thus confine itself to a categorisation of actors, strategies and instruments. Needless to say, these are closely linked, as instruments must be selected according to what is attempted, i.e. the strategy, which in turn is determined by the actors on the basis of their identities, interests and goals.  </span></div><div left="70.92" right="291.31" top="191.58"><span x0="70.92" y0="191.58" x1="291.31" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 191.58; y1: 205.56; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;">Actors: Identities, Interests and Goals  </span><span x0="70.92" y0="175.62" x1="527.93" style="x0: 70.92; x1: 79.46; y0: 175.62; y1: 189.6; width: 8.54; font-size: 13.98; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">The most obvious actors involved in the provision of global public goods are, of course, international organisations which are almost &#8220;born&#8221; in order to produce public goods or reduce public evils. Relevant distinctions here are geographical ones between global, regional, subregional and other organisations; and functional ones between, on the one hand, organisations created in order to manage problems of peace and security and, on the other hand, organisation which may either make indirect contributions towards these ends or which </span></div></body></html>
