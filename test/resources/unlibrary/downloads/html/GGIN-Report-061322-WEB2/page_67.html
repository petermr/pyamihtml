The end of the Cold War and its associat-ed camps and proxy wars improved conditions for North-South cooperation, as manifested in the ambitious action programs of successive UN summits between 1990 and 1996, new debt-re-lief measures for the poorest countries in the early 2000s, and the Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015). But many developing coun-tries note the failure of donor nations to deliver on the climate and broader sustainable devel-opment financing commitments contained, for example, in multiple climate summit commu-niques (2009-2021) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (2015).</span><span x0="162.35" y0="423.1" x1="171.14" style="x0: 162.35; x1: 165.34; y0: 423.1; y1: 429.51; width: 2.99; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">275</span></div><div left="97.25" right="309.33" top="400.71"><span x0="97.25" y0="400.71" x1="309.33" style="x0: 97.25; x1: 103.41; y0: 400.71; y1: 411.71; width: 6.16; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">Perspectives of leading northern and southern countries also diverged during the recent the-matic dialogues sponsored by the President of the General Assembly, in February and March of 2022, regarding the recommendations in </span><span x0="289.54" y0="348.71" x1="309.5" style="x0: 289.54; x1: 297.06; y0: 348.71; y1: 359.71; width: 7.52; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Italic;">Our Common Agenda </span><span x0="174.85" y0="335.71" x1="311.31" style="x0: 174.85; x1: 179.21; y0: 335.71; y1: 346.71; width: 4.37; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">(see box 7.1; see also box 1.1).

In November 2019, for example, CIVICUS warned that civil society space was &#8220;under attack in 111 countries,&#8221; and that more than six billion people live in coun-tries where civic space was &#8220;closed, repressed or obstructed.&#8221;</span><span x0="388.05" y0="423.78" x1="397.43" style="x0: 388.05; x1: 391.04; y0: 423.78; y1: 430.2; width: 2.99; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">279</span><span x0="400.27" y0="418.9" x1="531.81" style="x0: 400.27; x1: 407.58; y0: 418.9; y1: 429.9; width: 7.3; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">CIVICUS also observed that sixteen of nineteen UN Member States on the UN Economic and Social Council&#8217;s Non-Governmental Organization Committee, which grants civil society consultative status, imposed &#8220;serious civic space restrictions&#8221; within their borders.</span><span x0="358.43" y0="345.78" x1="368.85" style="x0: 358.43; x1: 361.45; y0: 345.78; y1: 352.2; width: 3.02; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">280</span><span x0="372.18" y0="340.9" x1="531.71" style="x0: 372.18; x1: 378.65; y0: 340.9; y1: 351.9; width: 6.48; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">Even those non-governmental or-ganizations that enjoy UN consultative status face difficulty in meaningfully providing advice to policymakers. Resourceful and large civil society organizations from the Global North, for instance, have disproportionate access to policymaking in global institutions compared to their counterparts from the Global South. At the same time, the UN&#8217;s frequently bureau- cratic and heavily state-centric decision-mak-ing processes can screen the UN from closely scrutinizing the struggles facing vulnerable groups worldwide, including victims of system- ic abuse.</span><span x0="358.27" y0="176.78" x1="367.07" style="x0: 358.27; x1: 361.26; y0: 176.78; y1: 183.2; width: 2.99; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">281</span></div><div left="319.48" right="512.58" top="145.96"><span x0="319.48" y0="145.96" x1="512.58" style="x0: 319.48; x1: 326.99; y0: 145.96; y1: 159.96; width: 7.5; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightSansProSemibold-Regular;">Striking the Right Balance at the 2023 Summit of the Future</span></div><div left="319.14" right="531.22" top="113.4"><span x0="319.14" y0="113.4" x1="531.22" style="x0: 319.14; x1: 325.87; y0: 113.4; y1: 124.4; width: 6.73; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">To overcome or at least effectively manage these three global political fault-lines&#8212;let alone the sheer organizational complexities associated with staging a UN heads of state and government </span></div></body></html>
