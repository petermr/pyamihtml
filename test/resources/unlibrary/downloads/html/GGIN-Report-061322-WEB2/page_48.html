This stems, in part, from a gap in accountability at the international level that must be bridged to bring about the nec-essary changes in human behavior to control climate change. At the annual COPs, decisions can only be made with consensus, essentially giving all countries veto power in any agree-ment. States that depend on large-scale fossil fuel production, or countries with large emis-sions deemed necessary for economic growth, have a vested interest in blunting any serious measures to constrain fossil fuels.</span><span x0="236.22" y0="319.91" x1="245.21" style="x0: 236.22; x1: 238.56; y0: 319.91; y1: 326.32; width: 2.35; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">169</span></div><div left="82.94" right="296.99" top="297.38"><span x0="82.94" y0="297.38" x1="296.99" style="x0: 82.94; x1: 90.32; y0: 297.38; y1: 308.38; width: 7.38; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">COP decisions can establish collective goals, standards, and rules to enable more effective action and cooperation among governments, but implementation rests with governments and private-sector stakeholders.

Crucially, effective leadership by large emitter countries at successive COPs rests on strong climate policies domestical-ly. States such as the UK, China, and the U.S. should build the credibility and authority to encourage others to do more by mirroring it in their own robust actions at home. Globally, climate finance is growing, but only slowly. </span></div><div left="304.85" right="516.84" top="680.76"><span x0="304.85" y0="680.76" x1="516.84" style="x0: 304.85; x1: 312.31; y0: 680.76; y1: 691.76; width: 7.47; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">Developed countries have yet to meet the Paris Agreement climate finance-pledge of U.S. $100 billion per year.</span><span x0="376.41" y0="658.93" x1="385.37" style="x0: 376.41; x1: 378.76; y0: 658.93; y1: 665.35; width: 2.35; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">170</span><span x0="388.39" y0="654.05" x1="517.29" style="x0: 388.39; x1: 395.12; y0: 654.05; y1: 665.05; width: 6.74; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">This deficit is cause for con- cern, especially as we have not yet seen COVID- 19&#8217;s full impact on climate finance.</span></div><div left="304.43" right="516.93" top="609.48"><span x0="304.43" y0="609.48" x1="516.93" style="x0: 304.43; x1: 311.06; y0: 609.48; y1: 620.48; width: 6.63; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">An effective low carbon future depends on Member States following through on their com-mitments. Thus far, sub-national governments and non-state actors have proven to be more like- ly to do so. For example, while the national gov-ernment of Brazil does not see climate change as a top priority, Brazilian states and municipalities have developed important interventions to mit-igate the negative effects of climate change and begin to adapt. After all, it is the local govern-ments that are most directly responsible for the quality of life of their population.</span><span x0="451.15" y0="467.46" x1="458.86" style="x0: 451.15; x1: 453.5; y0: 467.46; y1: 473.87; width: 2.35; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">171</span></div><div left="304.97" right="479.27" top="436.86"><span x0="304.97" y0="436.86" x1="479.27" style="x0: 304.97; x1: 312.02; y0: 436.86; y1: 448.86; width: 7.04; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightSansProSemibold-Italic;">Road to 2023 Innovation Proposals </span></div><div left="304.77" right="489.94" top="419.13"><span x0="304.77" y0="419.13" x1="489.94" style="x0: 304.77; x1: 311.92; y0: 419.13; y1: 430.13; width: 7.15; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0.95]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBold-Italic;">Create Mechanisms for Better Decision-making at COP Summits </span></div><div left="304.74" right="517.27" top="389.59"><span x0="304.74" y0="389.59" x1="517.27" style="x0: 304.74; x1: 311.42; y0: 389.59; y1: 400.59; width: 6.68; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">The ultimate goal of climate action over the medi-um to long-term is achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. One of the Paris agreement&#8217;s character-istics contributing to its wide acceptance was its voluntary, non-binding nature for Member States, and another was its consensus decision-making. It would be extremely difficult to make the Paris commitments legally and politically binding on all signatories. Nevertheless, the parties to the UNFCCC should consider adopting a system of formal voting on all substantive decisions at the annual COPs, similar to UN General Assembly rules of procedure. States that do not have a deep stake in fossil fuel production but do have a stake in survival and prosperity, now and in the future, could create a sort of pro-compliance insurgency within the scope of the Paris agree-ment. This would allow decisions, such as the near-unanimous agreement at COP26 to phase out coal production, to be adopted by the world&#8217;s majority without being thwarted by a holdout minority. This, in turn, would send a stronger signal to countries, investors, and civil society that the parties to UNFCCC are serious about the threat of climate change. </span></div><div left="38.15" right="71.1" top="390.27"><span x0="38.15" y0="390.27" x1="71.1" style="x0: 38.15; x1: 43.72; y0: 390.27; y1: 399.27; width: 5.57; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightSansProBlack-Regular;">Climate</span></div></body></html>
