This pos-es serious justice concerns. Relying heavily on non-state actors, in particular multinational corporations and billionaires, to protect the Global Commons and deliver global public goods raises questions of transparency and of accountability to the public.</span><span x0="226.45" y0="480.69" x1="232.39" style="x0: 226.45; x1: 229.41; y0: 480.69; y1: 487.1; width: 2.96; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">73</span></div><div left="97.22" right="309.38" top="458.19"><span x0="97.22" y0="458.19" x1="309.38" style="x0: 97.22; x1: 101.12; y0: 458.19; y1: 469.19; width: 3.89; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">Inclusiveness, furthermore, needs to be seen through the lens of decoloniality. This means, first of all, revealing and acknowledging the continuing impact of, and underlying power imbalances resulting from, colonialism and, on that basis, working towards remedying them structurally. Better representation of Global South countries and citizens in key interna-tional institutions is one important part of this. </span></div><div left="96.83" right="309.2" top="335.72"><span x0="96.83" y0="335.72" x1="309.2" style="x0: 96.83; x1: 103.46; y0: 335.72; y1: 346.72; width: 6.63; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">At the same time, a decolonial approach also means critically unpacking notions of &#8220;civil so-ciety&#8221; and &#8220;multi-stakeholderism.&#8221; For instance, if any enhanced space for non-state actors at the UN is taken up by predominantly Western/Global North corporations and civil society organizations, then this can increase rather than break down coloniality-derived structural power imbalances. Similarly, the views that current non-state actors hold and the input they provide to multilateral processes need to be critically interrogated from the point of view of representativeness&#8212;or to use the term from the UN75 Global Conversation, &#8220;people centeredness.&#8221; This includes critically re- flecting on gender issues and the concerns of fu-ture generations. In other words, it should not be accepted at face value that these actors speak on behalf or in the interest of groups whose voices remain marginalized in global governance.</span></div><div left="96.98" right="309.17" top="82.17"><span x0="96.98" y0="82.17" x1="309.17" style="x0: 96.98; x1: 107.18; y0: 82.17; y1: 93.17; width: 10.2; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">While many non-state actors can and do make valuable contributions towards what </span></div><div left="319.3" right="417.3" top="567.56"><span x0="319.3" y0="567.56" x1="417.3" style="x0: 319.3; x1: 326.86; y0: 567.56; y1: 578.56; width: 7.56; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Italic;">Our Common Agenda </span><span x0="417.02" y0="567.56" x1="534.27" style="x0: 417.02; x1: 421.87; y0: 567.56; y1: 578.56; width: 4.85; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">calls a &#8220;new global deal,&#8221; others with nefarious or at best mixed objec-tives raise concerns in terms of both security and justice. This includes terrorist groups and organized crime, but to some extent could be applied to other non-state actors in light of their respective self-interests and ways in which they pursue them.

It went on to make several specific proposals for reform in the spirit of these ideas. As argued here, crafting a mutually reinforcing relation-ship between justice and security imperatives remains a challenge that permeates these con-cepts. This requires a delicate balance to be struck in the further development and imple-mentation of the various innovation proposals of the OCA and beyond, as organized in this re-port around the Four C&#8217;s of conflict, COVID-19, climate, and collaborative economy.</span></div><div left="118.75" right="506.94" top="696.93"><span x0="118.75" y0="696.93" x1="506.94" style="x0: 118.75; x1: 129.55; y0: 696.93; y1: 718.93; width: 10.8; font-size: 22.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0.9]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightSansProBook-Italic;">Strengthening social contracts, inaugurating a new global deal, and enhancing ways to make better use of the potential of multi-stakeholder approaches in global governance&#8230;are all exercises on bringing about just security.</span></div></body></html>
