Complex political, social, and economic factors behind armed con- flicts make conflict prediction incredibly chal-lenging. Emerging risks and dangerous trends, such as the instability caused by climate change, create further pressure on existing forms of fore- sight and prevention. Nonetheless, better fore-sight and prevention capabilities would allow the UN to do a better job addressing the underlying causes of conflicts before they tip into violence. </span></div><div left="304.97" right="479.27" top="397.37"><span x0="304.97" y0="397.37" x1="479.27" style="x0: 304.97; x1: 312.02; y0: 397.37; y1: 409.37; width: 7.04; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightSansProSemibold-Italic;">Road to 2023 Innovation Proposals </span></div><div left="304.78" right="502.93" top="379.82"><span x0="304.78" y0="379.82" x1="502.93" style="x0: 304.78; x1: 312.57; y0: 379.82; y1: 390.82; width: 7.79; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0.95]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBold-Italic;">Upgrade the Peacebuilding Commission to an empowered Peacebuilding Council</span></div><div left="304.74" right="517.08" top="350.64"><span x0="304.74" y0="350.64" x1="517.08" style="x0: 304.74; x1: 311.47; y0: 350.64; y1: 361.64; width: 6.73; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">Today&#8217;s worsening security landscape not only requires nimble intervention but also increas-es the demand for post-conflict peacebuilding. Upgrading the Peacebuilding Commission to an empowered UN Peacebuilding Council (new PBC) can complement and assist in the Security Council&#8217;s challenging task of maintaining glob- al peace and security. With an expanded man-date, the Peacebuilding Council would have enhanced powers and responsibilities to lead on conflict prevention and peacebuilding pol-icy development, coordination, and resource mobilization on critical second- and third-or-der conflicts, freeing up the Security Council to concentrate on first-order conflicts that most threaten international peace and security. </span></div><div left="304.74" right="516.89" top="135.37"><span x0="304.74" y0="135.37" x1="516.89" style="x0: 304.74; x1: 311.54; y0: 135.37; y1: 146.37; width: 6.8; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">The new PBC would focus on countries and regions in non-peacekeeping and post-conflict environments where it can monitor and coor-dinate actions to prevent conflict recurrence.
