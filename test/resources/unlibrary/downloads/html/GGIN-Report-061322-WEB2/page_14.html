It also revealed deep-seated tensions between enhanced global connectivi-ty, on one hand, and major fault-lines in global governance, including renewed great-power ri-valries and Global North-South distrust, on the other. The COVID-19 pandemic and UN75 may be only brief episodes in world history, but if en-gaged boldly and creatively, they can each yield valuable new thinking, planning, and action in increasingly critical spheres of global gover-nance&#8212;including the &#8220;Four C&#8217;s&#8221;
