Regrettably, in the years that followed, the violent conflicts and environmental degradation we documented in our report have only grown more acute, now punctuated by Russia&#8217;s war on Ukraine. The COVID-19 pan-demic, moreover, has claimed millions of lives and brought devastating social and economic consequences to billions worldwide.</span></div><div left="97.14" right="531.27" top="537.1"><span x0="97.14" y0="537.1" x1="531.27" style="x0: 97.14; x1: 103.87; y0: 537.1; y1: 548.1; width: 6.73; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">These developments underscore the central importance of the need for humanity to embrace the idea of just security.

They also lend support to&#8212;and elaborate twenty concrete ideas for&#8212;a Summit of the Future, recommended to coincide, in September 2023, with the General Assembly&#8217;s high-level week. In 2015, our Commission called for a similar World Conference on Global Institutions. Further to the recent thematic consulta-tions with Member States conducted by the President of the General Assembly, I am delighted that the Summit of the Future is now highly anticipated next year with the goal of bringing much needed improvements to global governance.</span></div><div left="97.25" right="459.65" top="346.1"><span x0="97.25" y0="346.1" x1="459.65" style="x0: 97.25; x1: 103.46; y0: 346.1; y1: 357.1; width: 6.22; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">Last October, in advance of United Nations Day, Madeleine Albright and I wrote:</span><span x0="459.54" y0="350.99" x1="461.89" style="x0: 459.54; x1: 461.89; y0: 350.99; y1: 357.4; width: 2.35; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">1</span></div><div left="97.18" right="531.17" top="328.6"><span x0="97.18" y0="328.6" x1="531.17" style="x0: 97.18; x1: 104.95; y0: 328.6; y1: 339.6; width: 7.78; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Italic;">Not since World War II has the international community confronted as monumental a test as the intertwined crises of COVID-19 and climate change, and the profound social and economic inequalities they have exposed. Yet precisely when global, collective action is most needed to address these crises, exclusionary nationalism and rising great-power tensions, including a new Cold War-like standoff between democracies and autocracies, are eroding essential multilateral cooperation.</span></div><div left="97.14" right="531.18" top="259.1"><span x0="97.14" y0="259.1" x1="531.18" style="x0: 97.14; x1: 103.91; y0: 259.1; y1: 270.1; width: 6.77; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">Throughout her remarkable career, Madeleine never shied away from condemning those who sought to undermine fundamental norms and institutions of global governance.
