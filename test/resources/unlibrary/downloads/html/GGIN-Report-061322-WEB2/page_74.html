Coping better with the Four Cs and other global challenges will require the development of new conceptual tools, in-cluding by enriching&#8212;through a just security framework&#8212;UN Secretary-General Ant&#243;nio Guterres&#8217; notions of a new social contract, new global deal, and networked and inclusive multilateralism.

The case for shifting our thinking on and the design of global governance becomes ever more glaring when one considers the scale and complexity of the ongoing pandem-ic, the accelerating pace of climate change, and other nearly unparalleled global challenges. </span></div><div left="303.86" right="516.19" top="237.42"><span x0="303.86" y0="237.42" x1="516.19" style="x0: 303.86; x1: 314.01; y0: 237.42; y1: 248.42; width: 10.15; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">While the Pact for the Future to be endorsed at next year&#8217;s Summit of the Future&#8212;like the Paris Peace Pact&#8212;may not lead overnight to the resolution of today&#8217;s colossal global prob-lems, it could set into motion a series of events and facilitate, over time, a more comprehensive and impactful overhaul of our international sys-tem and of the laws and norms that underpin it. Armed with this measured outlook that com-bines patience with courage and imagination, we cannot afford to aim for less between now and the Summit, because nothing less than hu- manity&#8217;s future hangs in the balance.</span></div></body></html>
