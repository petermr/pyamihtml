Moreover, the Coalition for the UN We Need, the Together First campaign, and other partners across civil society plan to con-vene regional civil society dialogues, monthly multi-stakeholder dialogues, and a Global Peo-ple&#8217;s Assembly, which could rally support for ideas presented in a planned &#8220;People&#8217;s Pact for the Future&#8221; in the run-up to next year&#8217;s summit.</span></div><div left="82.59" right="92.43" top="494.45"><span x0="82.59" y0="494.45" x1="92.43" style="x0: 82.59; x1: 87.22; y0: 494.45; y1: 505.45; width: 4.63; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">5. </span><span x0="92.87" y0="494.22" x1="295.35" style="x0: 92.87; x1: 99.6; y0: 494.22; y1: 505.22; width: 6.73; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBold-Italic;">Build consensus around select global gover- nance strengthening proposals</span><span x0="221.85" y0="481.1" x1="226.79" style="x0: 221.85; x1: 224.4; y0: 481.1; y1: 492.1; width: 2.55; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBold-Regular;">: </span><span x0="226.18" y0="481.3" x1="296.97" style="x0: 226.18; x1: 232.74; y0: 481.3; y1: 492.3; width: 6.56; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">As noted above, the Summit&#8217;s formal preparatory negotiations, from February to September 2023, could involve diverse, UN Permanent Representative-led the- matic committees and smaller task forces orga-nized around four pillars: i) peace, security, and humanitarian action; ii) sustainable development and COVID-19 recovery; iii) human rights, inclu- sive governance, and the rule of law; and iv) cli- mate governance. The co-chairs of the fifth, inte-grative pillar Executive Committee would serve, simultaneously, as the overall co-coordinators for providing strategic direction to Summit of the Future preparations, in close consultation with the President of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General, and his representative lead-ing the Summit&#8217;s secretariat. </span></div><div left="82.94" right="294.77" top="253.2"><span x0="82.94" y0="253.2" x1="294.77" style="x0: 82.94; x1: 90.99; y0: 253.2; y1: 264.2; width: 8.05; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">One of the most important roles of the Executive Committee Co-Chairs, Committee Co-Chairs, and the Under-Secretary-General&#8217;s organizing team would be to keep UN Member States fo-cused on building consensus around a select number of priority institutional, policy, legal, operational, and normative global governance strengthening proposals (e.g., around 8-10 per thematic pillar, plus 8-10 more to promote in-tegrated, system-wide innovation).

Among the goals of these multi-stakeholder re-gional forums could be to garner broad-based support for and refine the Pact for the Future and related instruments&#8217; recommendations among diverse stakeholders beyond the &#8220;New York Bubble.&#8221; Building on earlier diverse, multi-actor gatherings held worldwide during the Pact&#8217;s negotiation phase, these regional di-alogues could further culminate in three global gatherings&#8212;&#8220;Global Futures Forums&#8221; for par-liamentarians, young leaders, and global civil society&#8212;concurrent with (and as integral parts of) the Summit of the Future. Often neglected in UN summitry, parliamentarians, youth, and civil society have fresh ideas on the future of global governance to bring to the table. Importantly, they all possess agency and, in the case of legis- lators, an officially mandated role&#8212;often includ-ing budgetary oversight&#8212;to generate a sense of co-responsibility in supporting follow-through to the Summit. This might well serve as a dress rehearsal for the United Nations Parliamentary Network (Overview 6.3), which many hope could emerge from the September 2023 Summit.</span></div><div left="304.89" right="315.54" top="266.35"><span x0="304.89" y0="266.35" x1="315.54" style="x0: 304.89; x1: 310.39; y0: 266.35; y1: 277.35; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">6. </span><span x0="315.74" y0="266.12" x1="517.34" style="x0: 315.74; x1: 322.56; y0: 266.12; y1: 277.12; width: 6.82; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBold-Italic;">Adopt a Pact for the Future and other stra- tegic frameworks for global action</span><span x0="461.41" y0="253.0" x1="466.42" style="x0: 461.41; x1: 463.95; y0: 253.0; y1: 264.0; width: 2.54; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBold-Regular;">: </span><span x0="465.9" y0="253.2" x1="517.29" style="x0: 465.9; x1: 475.96; y0: 253.2; y1: 264.2; width: 10.06; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">World lead-ers convening for the Summit of the Future, in September 2023 in New York, should endorse a comprehensive Pact for the Future that in-troduces concrete, measurable, and adequately resourced commitments across the above men-tioned four thematic areas. In particular, the P4TF&#8217;s select (around 40-50) global governance strengthening and innovation proposals would provide new tools and political momentum to better cope with the next pandemic disease, the growing prospect of runaway climate change, violence in fragile states and involving the Great Powers, cross-border economic shocks, and ever more sophisticated cyber-attacks.
