In addition, during the Summit, the cli-mate and biodiversity conventions were made open for signature (and later ratification by na- tional legislatures) and work toward a deserti-fication convention was initiated, and finalized for signature by 1994. Though quite distinct from this earlier process, the Summit of the Future could deliver on an ambitious and com- prehensive global governance innovation agen-da too, including through a Pact for the Future, a Declaration on Future Generations, a New Agenda for Peace, and a Global Digital Compact. Achieving, in the words of the Secretary- General, &#8220;more inclusive, networked, and effec-tive forms of multilateralism,&#8221; requires a robust, determined process with inspired leadership both from within and outside of governments.</span><span x0="519.91" y0="252.72" x1="528.88" style="x0: 519.91; x1: 522.87; y0: 252.72; y1: 259.13; width: 2.96; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">283</span></div><div left="319.14" right="531.27" top="230.27"><span x0="319.14" y0="230.27" x1="531.27" style="x0: 319.14; x1: 325.92; y0: 230.27; y1: 241.27; width: 6.78; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">To prepare for the Summit and maximize its impact in line with the &#8220;just right&#8221; approach outlined above, seven preparatory and fol-low-through steps (many running in parallel) are both necessary and desirable (see figure 7.1). </span></div><div left="318.95" right="329.13" top="160.48"><span x0="318.95" y0="160.48" x1="329.13" style="x0: 318.95; x1: 323.02; y0: 160.48; y1: 171.48; width: 4.07; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">1. </span><span x0="331.67" y0="160.25" x1="531.25" style="x0: 331.67; x1: 339.29; y0: 160.25; y1: 171.25; width: 7.62; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBold-Italic;">Design an inclusive, forward-leaning Modalities Resolution</span><span x0="425.91" y0="147.22" x1="428.48" style="x0: 425.91; x1: 428.48; y0: 147.22; y1: 158.22; width: 2.58; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBold-Regular;">:</span><span x0="432.24" y0="147.42" x1="531.72" style="x0: 432.24; x1: 436.14; y0: 147.42; y1: 158.42; width: 3.9; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">In addition to estab- lishing a Summit secretariat and acknowledg- ing the forthcoming report of the Secretary-General&#8217;s High-Level Advisory Board (HLAB) on Effective Multilateralism, the modalities resolution should recommend transparent negotiations that include and tap the ideas, </span></div></body></html>
