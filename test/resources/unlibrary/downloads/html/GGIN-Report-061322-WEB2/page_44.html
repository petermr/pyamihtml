Such national institutions need support from international institutions, including to help them better contend with global demographic trends, which indicate that 71 percent of people born by the end of the cen-tury will be born into low- or middle-income countries, helping to only intensify global inequality.</span><span x0="130.6" y0="118.43" x1="138.49" style="x0: 130.6; x1: 132.95; y0: 118.43; y1: 124.84; width: 2.35; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">153</span></div><div left="82.43" right="295.29" top="95.76"><span x0="82.43" y0="95.76" x1="295.29" style="x0: 82.43; x1: 89.0; y0: 95.76; y1: 106.76; width: 6.57; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">As it stands, however, no global governance ac- tor, among international organizations, govern-ments, or civil society organizations, represents </span></div><div left="305.18" right="391.36" top="664.22"><span x0="305.18" y0="664.22" x1="391.36" style="x0: 305.18; x1: 308.61; y0: 664.22; y1: 675.22; width: 3.43; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">future generations.</span><span x0="391.29" y0="669.11" x1="399.5" style="x0: 391.29; x1: 393.64; y0: 669.11; y1: 675.52; width: 2.35; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">154</span><span x0="402.04" y0="664.22" x1="516.88" style="x0: 402.04; x1: 408.78; y0: 664.22; y1: 675.22; width: 6.73; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">The burden we face need not be one of optimization, but simply to en- sure we do not irretrievably foreclose the pos-sibilities of future generations.
