The EP could convene both the usual and some less traditional entities, within and beyond the UN system, that could play a role in amelio-rating a particular crisis. Through careful yet swift, context-sensitive analysis and skillful diplomacy, the Secretary-General and his or her lieutenants could also add-value to exist- ing arrangements by forging, through the plat-form, an international and multi-stakeholder consensus on the underlying causes of, and the most urgently needed measures to manage and over time resolve, a complex emergency. In ad-dition, the EP would benefit, at the operational level, from the ability to draw upon new rapid response capacities. </span></div><div left="97.17" right="225.67" top="138.2"><span x0="97.17" y0="138.2" x1="225.67" style="x0: 97.17; x1: 104.32; y0: 138.2; y1: 149.2; width: 7.15; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0.95]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBold-Italic;">Create a Standing Civilian  Protection Service</span></div><div left="97.25" right="309.14" top="108.85"><span x0="97.25" y0="108.85" x1="309.14" style="x0: 97.25; x1: 103.47; y0: 108.85; y1: 119.85; width: 6.22; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">Past Stimson Center reports have spoken to the need for upgrading civilian, policing, and military capabilities in support of UN-led, multi-dimensional peace, development, and </span></div><div left="319.66" right="498.71" top="638.12"><span x0="319.66" y0="638.12" x1="498.71" style="x0: 319.66; x1: 325.53; y0: 638.12; y1: 649.12; width: 5.87; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">humanitarian field-based operations.</span><span x0="498.87" y0="643.0" x1="506.63" style="x0: 498.87; x1: 501.24; y0: 643.0; y1: 649.42; width: 2.37; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">115</span><span x0="510.5" y0="638.12" x1="531.24" style="x0: 510.5; x1: 517.29; y0: 638.12; y1: 649.12; width: 6.8; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">The Fletcher School&#8217;s Ian Johnstone recently intro-duced a related, creative set of ideas for what he termed a &#8220;Standing Civilian Protection Service&#8221; (SCPS).

Comprising a total of 2,400 personnel, the SCPS would be organized around twenty &#8220;Joint Protection Teams&#8221; consisting of approximately 120 civilian, police, and military personnel each.</span><span x0="481.82" y0="480.4" x1="489.87" style="x0: 481.82; x1: 484.17; y0: 480.4; y1: 486.82; width: 2.35; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">116</span></div><div left="318.98" right="533.35" top="457.47"><span x0="318.98" y0="457.47" x1="533.35" style="x0: 318.98; x1: 329.07; y0: 457.47; y1: 468.47; width: 10.1; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">With an overarching goal of protecting civilians, the Standing Civilian Protection Service could tailor its suite of bespoke services to the unique needs of a challenging, high-threat environment, including dialogue and community engagement; local level conflict resolution facilitation; and pro- active support to vulnerable groups.</span><span x0="473.89" y0="381.05" x1="481.35" style="x0: 473.89; x1: 476.22; y0: 381.05; y1: 387.47; width: 2.33; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">117</span><span x0="483.11" y0="376.16" x1="531.46" style="x0: 483.11; x1: 488.61; y0: 376.16; y1: 387.16; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">Successful implementation of the SCPS model would stem, in part, from intensive training&#8212;undertaken in six to ten hubs worldwide&#8212;on both basic protec- tion of civilian tasks and the particular dynam-ics and context of a situation to which its Joint Protection teams could be deployed.</span></div><div left="420.05" right="427.78" top="276.81"><span x0="420.05" y0="276.81" x1="427.78" style="x0: 420.05; x1: 423.87; y0: 276.81; y1: 287.81; width: 3.82; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">**</span></div><div left="319.14" right="531.72" top="258.76"><span x0="319.14" y0="258.76" x1="531.72" style="x0: 319.14; x1: 325.93; y0: 258.76; y1: 269.76; width: 6.79; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">Though addressing acute gaps in the interna- tional community&#8217;s architecture for respond-ing to complex global crises, the proposed Emergency Platform and Standing Civilian Protection Service are likely to face resistance from actors within and outside the UN system who might question their comparative advan-tages, price-tags, and level of interoperability with existing crisis-specific response arrange-ments. However, next year&#8217;s Summit of the Future&#8212;which will bring together world lead-ers to consider global governance system-wide improvements&#8212;offers the potential to generate requisite political support for these ideas and their subsequent initial proof of concept.</span></div><div left="119.83" right="510.88" top="698.56"><span x0="119.83" y0="698.56" x1="510.88" style="x0: 119.83; x1: 130.63; y0: 698.56; y1: 720.56; width: 10.8; font-size: 22.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0.9]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightSansProBook-Italic;">Successful implementation of the SCPS model would stem, in part, from intensive training.</span></div></body></html>
