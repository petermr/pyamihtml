Prominent examples include coining the concept of &#8220;sus-tainable development&#8221; by the 1987 World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission), which paved the way to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and &#8220;the responsi-bility to protect&#8221; (&#8220;R2P&#8221;), first presented in the 2001 report of the  International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, which was taken up by the 2005 World Summit Outcome and continues to frame the debate on responses to mass atrocities.</span></div><div left="82.85" right="295.32" top="385.64"><span x0="82.85" y0="385.64" x1="295.32" style="x0: 82.85; x1: 89.32; y0: 385.64; y1: 396.64; width: 6.47; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">Even in an environment of increasing geopo- litical tensions, ideas matter as a common lan-guage and as a platform for crafting a common outlook.

As noted in section I, based on an extensive consultative process, the following sections develop further a number of recommendations that were includ-ed in the 2015 report of the Albright-Gambari Commission, several of the OCA proposals, and ideas drawn from the deliberations of sever-al Global and Regional Policy Dialogues (see figure 1.2). Implemented together, the twenty innovations offered in sections III through VI below would make a major contribution to plac- ing justice and security considerations in a mu-tually supportive relationship in contemporary global governance.</span></div><div left="304.82" right="516.96" top="359.64"><span x0="304.82" y0="359.64" x1="516.96" style="x0: 304.82; x1: 308.72; y0: 359.64; y1: 370.64; width: 3.9; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">In 2015, the Albright-Gambari Commission delved into the complex relationship between justice and security in global governance. It stressed that justice and security exist in a mu-tually dependent relationship. According to the Commission, on the one hand security would merely be &#8220;the appearance of order in a frame-work of structural violence unless tempered or leavened by concepts of justice that include human rights, human dignity, legitimate gov-ernment, and other normative limits on the use of power.&#8221; On the other, &#8220;the pursuit of justice is crippled if not backed up by the requisite means to sustain security and order.&#8221; Hence, the report urged for global governance reform &#8220;to forge a mutually supportive system of ac-countable, fair, and effective governance and sustainable peace globally,&#8221; involving both state and non-state actors.</span><span x0="401.76" y0="130.46" x1="407.79" style="x0: 401.76; x1: 404.44; y0: 130.46; y1: 136.88; width: 2.68; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">39</span></div><div left="304.82" right="516.89" top="108.07"><span x0="304.82" y0="108.07" x1="516.89" style="x0: 304.82; x1: 308.72; y0: 108.07; y1: 119.07; width: 3.89; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: AGNTBM+FreightTextProBook-Regular;">In a world of rising geopolitical tensions and other challenges (as discussed in section I above), the need for just security has only increased.
