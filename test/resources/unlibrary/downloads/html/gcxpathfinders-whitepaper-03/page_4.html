My colleague works at a center in Kramatorsk, just a few miles from the frontline. Seven days a week he arrives at 8am to find a queue already forming and the phones are already ringing. For the next 12 hours, he will sit in the cold, the heating and water supply having stopped weeks ago, and help people to find answers and solutions to their urgent justice needs. &#8216;How can I leave the country if I&#8217;ve lost my passport?&#8217; &#8216;How can I receive my pension if I&#8217;m internally displaced?&#8217; &#8216;Can I be fired from my job under martial law?&#8217; &#8216;Where can I get help to rebuild my house which was damaged by shelling?&#8217; The safety and well- being of entire families can hinge on the answers to these questions.&#8221;</span></div><div left="69.12" right="146.84" top="69.2"><span x0="69.12" y0="69.2" x1="146.84" style="x0: 69.12; x1: 75.76; y0: 69.2; y1: 78.7; width: 6.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: RYMUPE+MarkOffcPro-Heavy;">Yevgen Poltenko</span><span x0="147.11" y0="69.27" x1="476.47" style="x0: 147.11; x1: 149.47; y0: 69.27; y1: 78.77; width: 2.36; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; font-family: RYMUPE+MarkOffcPro-Book;">,  Executive Director of the Legal Development Network (LDN) in Ukraine</span></div></body></html>
