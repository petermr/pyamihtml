This will support nations, communities, and people in rebuilding their social contract as a foundation for sustaining peace. By engaging public participation, institutions can deliver what people need most, and build on the SDGs. Distrust is fueled by inequality and corruption, and so this Agenda, this renewed social contract must have, at its core, justice.</span></div><div left="259.99" right="380.82" top="721.54"><span x0="259.99" y0="721.54" x1="380.82" style="x0: 259.99; x1: 265.89; y0: 721.54; y1: 732.54; width: 5.91; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0.071, 0.271, 0.29]; stroke: [0.067, 0.333, 0.8]; font-family: RYMUPE+MarkOffcPro-BoldItalic;">Justice Action Coalition</span></div><div left="259.99" right="530.78" top="694.64"><span x0="259.99" y0="694.64" x1="530.78" style="x0: 259.99; x1: 266.34; y0: 694.64; y1: 705.14; width: 6.35; font-size: 10.5; fill: [0.071, 0.271, 0.29]; stroke: [0.067, 0.333, 0.8]; font-family: RYMUPE+MarkOffcPro-Book;">To close the widening justice gap, we need bold action and ambition, political will and collaboration between different stakeholders championing equal access to justice for all.
