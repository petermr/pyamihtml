We must increase innovation in the justice sector by providing new ways to address problems and reduce bureaucracy and complexity. And, we must improve justice journeys for those engaging with the justice system from the point of entry through to resolution of their problems. This means access to people-centered justice services with accelerated and simplified processes, alternative pathways to justice and one-stop service provision for those in need.</span></div><div left="312.75" right="543.12" top="312.95"><span x0="312.75" y0="312.95" x1="543.12" style="x0: 312.75; x1: 319.85; y0: 312.95; y1: 323.45; width: 7.1; font-size: 10.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: RYMUPE+MarkOffcPro-Bold;">Support civic space and enhance partnerships to repair the social contract. </span><span x0="456.75" y0="299.42" x1="543.87" style="x0: 456.75; x1: 468.27; y0: 299.42; y1: 309.92; width: 11.52; font-size: 10.5; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: RYMUPE+MarkOffcPro-Book;">We must use the experience of the last two years to better prepare for the future.  International processes which require the deep partnership of civil society to succeed, from the most recent COP26 on climate to the decisions of the G7 and G20, are failing to engage people in the way they must to engender change. By focusing on making people partners in delivering justice &#8211; not just objects of institutions and laws, but participants in their shaping and execution &#8211; we can foster the collective will and energy to tackle the globe&#8217;s most pressing challenges together. </span></div><div left="45.0" right="570.82" top="643.25"><span x0="45.0" y0="643.25" x1="570.82" style="x0: 45.0; x1: 57.27; y0: 643.25; y1: 658.25; width: 12.27; font-size: 15.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: RYMUPE+MarkOffcPro-Light;">Global Citizen is ready to play our part by  amplifying the voices of Global Citizens and by  working with partners and stakeholders to articulate a new vision of justice in the context of our campaigning &#8212; one that centers on people, protects their interests, resolves their justice problems, leads to fair outcomes and delivers on their expectations. </span></div></body></html>
