Global Citizen was proud to showcase the launch of the Legal Empowerment Fund (LEF) at Global Citizen Live in September 2021. The LEF was launched through collaboration between the Fund for Global Human Rights, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and Namati, and is supported by the Pathfinders for Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies. Its goal is to provide urgently needed support to grassroots justice defenders and organizations fighting to help people understand and claim their rights.</span><span x0="347.31" y0="523.68" x1="354.6" style="x0: 347.31; x1: 350.99; y0: 523.68; y1: 529.8; width: 3.67; font-size: 6.12; fill: [0.071, 0.271, 0.29]; stroke: [0.067, 0.333, 0.8]; font-family: RYMUPE+MarkOffcPro-Book;">12</span></div><div left="259.99" right="524.58" top="492.14"><span x0="259.99" y0="492.14" x1="524.58" style="x0: 259.99; x1: 267.1; y0: 492.14; y1: 502.64; width: 7.12; font-size: 10.5; fill: [0.071, 0.271, 0.29]; stroke: [0.067, 0.333, 0.8]; font-family: RYMUPE+MarkOffcPro-Book;">Reducing discrimination and bolstering participation in legal processes are crucial first steps to empowering people to make positive impacts in the fight against poverty and climate change. It is here that the LEF, formed as a bold new initiative to close the global justice gap, comes into play. Initiatives like the Legal Empowerment Fund are a critical step towards creating a future where all people can enjoy equal protections and remedies under the law. Through supporting grassroots justice groups with renewable and long-term core funding, the LEF will enhance access to justice and push forward systemic change by putting the law in people&#8217;s hands &#8211; critical steps in the fight for justice for all. </span></div><div left="259.99" right="528.01" top="303.14"><span x0="259.99" y0="303.14" x1="528.01" style="x0: 259.99; x1: 267.69; y0: 303.14; y1: 313.64; width: 7.71; font-size: 10.5; fill: [0.071, 0.271, 0.29]; stroke: [0.067, 0.333, 0.8]; font-family: RYMUPE+MarkOffcPro-Book;">#GlobalCitizenLive saw @mottfoundation @hewlett_found announce the launch of the Legal Empowerment Fund &amp; commit $20M, + $5M from @globalnamati to help grassroots activists tackle systemic injustice&#8211; an important step forward for people-centered justice movements.</span></div></body></html>
