Set up to address a market failure in long-term capital flows to post-conflict Europe and developing countries, they combined financial heft and technical knowl-edge for more than five decades to support their borrowing members&#8217; investments in post-conflict reconstruction, growth stimulation, and poverty reduction. However, the geo-economic landscape has changed dra-matically in this century, and with it the demands and needs of the developing world. Developing countries now make up half of the global economy. The capital market failure that originally motivated the MDBs is less acute. Almost all devel-oping countries now rely primarily on domestic resources to manage public investment, and some of the poorest countries can borrow abroad on their own. Similarly, growth and the globalization of professional expertise on development practice have eroded whatever near-monopoly of advisory services the MDBs once had. At the same time, new challenges call for global collective action and financing of the sort the MDBs are well suited to provide but have been handicapped in doing so effectively. The list goes beyond major financial shocks, where the IMF&#8217;s role is clear&#8212;ranging from climate change, pandemic risk, increasing resistance to antibiotics, and poor management of international migration flows and of displaced and refugee populations. Other areas include the cross-border security and spillovers associated with growing competition for water and other renewable natural resources, and, with climate change, an increase in the frequency and human costs of weather and other shocks in low-income countries that are poorly equipped to respond. The World Bank has stepped in with emergency financing </span></div><div left="307.5" right="557.19" top="517.3"><span x0="307.5" y0="517.3" x1="557.19" style="x0: 307.5; x1: 311.03; y0: 517.3; y1: 528.3; width: 3.53; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">some donors earmarked to deal with climate change. But the MDBs as a group, built around the country loan as their key product, have had neither the core mandate nor the type and volume of financing to go beyond modest ad hoc responses to these new challenges. In addition, the global economy may be entering more than a brief period of demand-limited low growth and secular stagnation. In much of the developing world, high debt and fiscal constraints are reducing investment in power, roads, ports, and other public infrastructure&#8212;just when continuing growth of the working age population makes infrastructure critical to poverty-reducing growth, and just as the opportu-nity for innovation in climate-friendly infrastructure could help restart sustainable and sustained global growth. Though developing countries recovered reasonably well following the 2008&#8211;10 global financial crisis&#8212;especially relative to high-income countries&#8212;much of that growth relied on low global interest rates and a commodity boom driven largely by China&#8217;s demands. The risk of stalled growth all over the world as we write this report is a reminder that the development successes of the last five decades&#8212;including dramatic reductions in material poverty, illiteracy, and infant mortality, and rapid growth of emerging market economies resulting in conver-gence toward rich-country incomes and a dramatic reduction in global inequality&#8212;relied heavily on economic growth in the developing world. But its continuation cannot be taken for granted. These new and urgent challenges&#8212;including a restart of the healthy rates of economic growth that are at the heart of the MDBs&#8217; contribution to the globally agreed sustain-able development goals&#8212;have in common disproportionate risks and benefits for the developing world, and a particular need to combine financing, technical and country expertise, </span></div><div left="48.0" right="301.86" top="637.66"><span x0="48.0" y0="637.66" x1="301.86" style="x0: 48.0; x1: 65.79; y0: 637.66; y1: 667.66; width: 17.79; font-size: 30.0; fill: [1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Light;">Executive summary</span></div></body></html>
