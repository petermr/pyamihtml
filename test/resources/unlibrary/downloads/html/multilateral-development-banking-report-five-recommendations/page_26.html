In the first decade of this century, a growing focus on reducing absolute poverty and improving people&#8217;s well-being brought reasonable new emphasis on education, health, social insur-ance, and environment programs led by the World Bank. Meanwhile, growing concerns about waste, corruption, and compliance in large infrastructure&#8212;particularly but not only in hydroelectric power and urban transport&#8212;reduced the share of infrastructure lending. More recently, with the increases in overall growth fueled by China&#8217;s (now declining) demand across the developing world today, infrastructure bottlenecks have become a more visible and critical constraint on sustaining that growth. And with the growing risk of a global growth slowdown, investing in infrastructure in the developing world has become a criti-cal spur to global demand, to the healthy continuation of the benefits of cooperation on global challenges associated with the convergence of income among rich and poor countries, and to the potential to quickly ramp up long-run investment in climate-friendly sustained growth. When Morocco switched on the world&#8217;s largest concen-trated solar power plant at Ourzazate earlier this year, it showed what is possible when public investment in sustain-able power works in partnership with the MDBs. A mix of market-based and concessional financing from the World Bank, AfDB, and EIB enabled Morocco to move forward with a massive investment in solar, which will ultimately provide power to more than 1 million consumers in Morocco and reduce carbon emissions by 760,000 tons a year. MDB partnerships can also catalyze private investment </span></div><div left="316.5" right="564.0" top="517.3"><span x0="316.5" y0="517.3" x1="564.0" style="x0: 316.5; x1: 322.16; y0: 517.3; y1: 528.3; width: 5.65; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">financing through the AsDB has unlocked commercial lend-ing for geothermal projects in Indonesia, including the 320 megawatt Sarulla geothermal power project.The panel believes that through landmark partnerships like Ourzazate and Sarulla, the MDBs are demonstrating that they are best equipped to address a triple challenge in infrastructure: </span><span x0="316.5" y0="419.0" x1="326.05" style="x0: 316.5; x1: 322.5; y0: 419.0; y1: 431.0; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Heavy;">&#8226; </span><span x0="328.5" y0="418.34" x1="349.77" style="x0: 328.5; x1: 338.12; y0: 418.34; y1: 429.34; width: 9.62; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro-It;">More</span><span x0="349.72" y0="419.3" x1="566.18" style="x0: 349.72; x1: 351.95; y0: 419.3; y1: 430.3; width: 2.23; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">, especially in Africa where energy poverty is deep and where transport infrastructure is vital to bind economies together.</span><span x0="316.5" y0="377.0" x1="326.05" style="x0: 316.5; x1: 322.5; y0: 377.0; y1: 389.0; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Heavy;">&#8226; </span><span x0="328.5" y0="376.34" x1="361.58" style="x0: 328.5; x1: 335.85; y0: 376.34; y1: 387.34; width: 7.35; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro-It;">Cleaner</span><span x0="361.07" y0="377.3" x1="566.24" style="x0: 361.07; x1: 363.36; y0: 377.3; y1: 388.3; width: 2.29; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">, including in coal-rich East and South Asia, to protect health and the environment locally and globally. </span><span x0="316.5" y0="349.0" x1="326.05" style="x0: 316.5; x1: 322.5; y0: 349.0; y1: 361.0; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Heavy;">&#8226; </span><span x0="328.5" y0="348.34" x1="421.28" style="x0: 328.5; x1: 338.11; y0: 348.34; y1: 359.34; width: 9.61; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro-It;">More privately financed</span><span x0="421.38" y0="349.3" x1="564.0" style="x0: 421.38; x1: 423.62; y0: 349.3; y1: 360.3; width: 2.23; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">, with limited public finance crowd-ing in private investors&#8212;because in sectors like power, public finance often in the past has filled a vacuum due not to a lack of private capital but to a lack of the regulatory and pricing environment that private capital demands. Success in these three areas relies heavily on the strengths of the MDBs as multilateral and collective institutions in a world where international cooperation is critical not only to development but to peace and security. The ability of the MDBs, new as well as legacy, to play these roles requires that their shareholders, especially their major shareholders, take the lead in pushing them in new directions.Critically, MDB success in this area is just as relevant to middle-income and emerging market countries as it is for low-income countries. Cleaner infrastructure will have the largest climate impact in these larger markets. And because these creditworthy countries have access to much greater volumes of financing outside of the MDBs, the market failures associ-ated with public infrastructure and clean technologies are as binding on these countries as they are on any other. </span></div><div left="57.0" right="374.6" top="637.66"><span x0="57.0" y0="637.66" x1="374.6" style="x0: 57.0; x1: 64.8; y0: 637.66; y1: 667.66; width: 7.8; font-size: 30.0; fill: [1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Light;">Increased investment in sustainable infrastructure</span></div><div left="57.0" right="147.4" top="677.52"><span x0="57.0" y0="677.52" x1="147.4" style="x0: 57.0; x1: 71.08; y0: 677.52; y1: 697.52; width: 14.08; font-size: 20.0; fill: [1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Medium;">Chapter 2</span></div></body></html>
