The legacy MDBs have a history of bringing financing and expertise to bear in countries hit by financial shocks&#8212;not duplicating the role of the IMF dealing with balance of pay-ments needs, but working with fiscal and program authorities to address budget issues, as in Mexico in 1994&#8211;95. Legacy MDBs have built or reformed social insurance programs with countercyclical effects that have endured, as in Southeast Asia after the 1997&#8211;98 financial crisis. And they have created tem-porary trade finance support to stabilize trade flows, as in Latin America in 2009&#8211;10. The MDBs have also proven critical in the reconstruction efforts that follow conflict and crisis, as in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake and in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire with the cessation of civil conflict in 2011.In cases involving balance of payments issues, the IMF has a clear leading role, but the MDBs also appropriately provide additional fiscal support in many of these situations. Dur-ing the global financial crisis, MDB financing disbursements exceeded those of the IMF (Table 1). As the number of MDBs grows, it is critical that responses to macroeconomic crises are well coordinated. In recent years, the role of MDBs has been as or more critical in the face of nonfinancial crises rooted in fragile or conflict-ridden settings, or following natural disasters: the West African Ebola outbreak, the ongoing refugee crisis asso-ciated with conflict in Syria, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2013 typhoon in the Philippines, and the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia. </span></div><div left="316.5" right="566.21" top="517.3"><span x0="316.5" y0="517.3" x1="566.21" style="x0: 316.5; x1: 324.88; y0: 517.3; y1: 528.3; width: 8.38; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">management and insurance, with MDBs and especially the World Bank playing a role in developing new products.</span><span x0="536.55" y0="508.08" x1="542.91" style="x0: 536.55; x1: 539.73; y0: 508.08; y1: 514.68; width: 3.18; font-size: 6.6; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">62</span><span x0="544.59" y0="503.3" x1="566.17" style="x0: 544.59; x1: 549.75; y0: 503.3; y1: 514.3; width: 5.16; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">Still, we know shocks will continue to hit in some form, somewhere, soon.

The proposed shift to regional MDBs for routine traditional lending will free up the World Bank to arm itself better for unpredictable contingencies and emergencies, particularly those that represent global bads by virtue of being cross-border and at a potential scale to have regional or global consequences. All MDBs should assess exist-ing policies and operations to better address crisis situations, including the ability to respond in a timely and effective way to help meet reconstruction needs in post-conflict situations. If we view the world through a crisis lens, it should come as no surprise that country demand for MDB financing has been growing. The global shock that caused MDB lending to spike in 2008&#8211;10 has been followed by a series of crises in the developing world of various sorts: regional and global pandemics like Ebola and Zika;</span><span x0="445.25" y0="158.08" x1="451.63" style="x0: 445.25; x1: 448.45; y0: 158.08; y1: 164.68; width: 3.2; font-size: 6.6; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">63</span><span x0="453.37" y0="153.3" x1="564.0" style="x0: 453.37; x1: 461.74; y0: 153.3; y1: 164.3; width: 8.37; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">major refugee and humani-</span></div><div left="316.5" right="565.82" top="125.98"><span x0="316.5" y0="125.98" x1="565.82" style="x0: 316.5; x1: 320.87; y0: 125.98; y1: 134.98; width: 4.37; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0.8]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">62.
