China&#8217;s decision to seek World Bank assistance starting in 1980 and Asian Development Bank (AsDB) assistance in 1986 resulted in a remarkably productive 30-year MDB partnership. Chinese officials have character-ized the MDB role as catalytic in promoting a reform agenda that lifted nearly 700 million people out of extreme poverty in just three decades.</span><span x0="135.69" y0="256.08" x1="138.9" style="x0: 135.69; x1: 138.9; y0: 256.08; y1: 262.68; width: 3.21; font-size: 6.6; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">2</span><span x0="141.47" y0="251.3" x1="297.71" style="x0: 141.47; x1: 153.01; y0: 251.3; y1: 262.3; width: 11.54; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">The collapse of the Soviet Union saw the MDBs move aggressively to help drive the transition to market economies in Central and Eastern Europe, particularly through the creation of a new MDB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), in 1991.The larger story is the role of the MDBs in fostering ideas, policies, and large-scale programs, often complementing and building on the macroeconomic reforms supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), that have been good for growth and resulted in large gains in living standards around the world. The World Bank put poverty reduction on the global agenda, supported the agricultural research that </span></div><div left="48.0" right="122.17" top="69.98"><span x0="48.0" y0="69.98" x1="122.17" style="x0: 48.0; x1: 52.37; y0: 69.98; y1: 78.98; width: 4.37; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0.8]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">1.

Finally, the legacy MDBs, and especially the World Bank, have become the trusted home (given their fiduciary and legal capacity as well as staff expertise on particular issues) of thousands of trust funds supported by donors for special purposes&#8212;from impact evaluation to climate finance, learning assessments, piloting new ideas in aid delivery (output-based aid), and the rollout of programs supported by a mix of phil-anthropic and western donors such as the Advance Market Commitment, which creates a &#8220;market&#8221; for pharmaceutical products that treat diseases primarily affecting the poor.</span><span x0="539.43" y0="228.08" x1="542.64" style="x0: 539.43; x1: 542.64; y0: 228.08; y1: 234.68; width: 3.21; font-size: 6.6; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">4</span></div><div left="319.5" right="557.16" top="209.3"><span x0="319.5" y0="209.3" x1="557.16" style="x0: 319.5; x1: 324.7; y0: 209.3; y1: 220.3; width: 5.2; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">Successes of the past reflect the particular combination of assets the MDBs bring together: not only financial resources, but technical depth across a wide range of economic and social issues, country knowledge, and fiduciary and legal capacity. All of these elements have been brought to bear in MDB policy engagements with developing country governments, which over many decades helped spur growth and policy reform in the developing world.All of this is not to suggest the World Bank and other MDBs have always been right on policies and effective on </span></div></body></html>
