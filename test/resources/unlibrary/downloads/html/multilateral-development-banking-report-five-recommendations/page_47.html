But perhaps the biggest boost to this agenda came from the Asian Development Bank&#8217;s (AsDB) 2015 decision to merge its concessional and non-concessional balance sheets.Under the AsDB merger, the assets of the concessional loan window, the Asian Development Fund (AsDF), are treated as equity and brought onto the bank&#8217;s core balance sheet. The AsDF equity, comprised of $30.8 billion in loans out-standing and $7.2 billion in liquidity/receivables, effectively triples AsDB capital to $53 billion. The expanded capital base increases overall lending capacity by 50 percent. Countries eligible for concessional funding will continue to be served in two ways. The poorest grant-only countries will continue to be supported by AsDF donor contributions. The other AsDF countries will continue to receive concessional lending from the newly combined balance sheet, with the cost of conces-sionality absorbed by the balance sheet. </span></div><div left="319.5" right="557.17" top="391.3"><span x0="319.5" y0="391.3" x1="557.17" style="x0: 319.5; x1: 331.27; y0: 391.3; y1: 402.3; width: 11.77; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">The AsDB merger has been described as win-win-win. AsDF countries see expanded access to lending; AsDB coun-tries also see expanded access (on non-concessional terms); and AsDF donors see a 50 percent reduction in their contributions to the grant fund as a result of a smaller pool of countries. Discussions are now under way at the World Bank to con-sider some version of the AsDB model, and it is useful to consider how the numbers might differ. For example, the IDA &#8220;equity&#8221; equivalent to the AsDF equity at the AsDB is currently about $175 billion. This compares with current IBRD usable equity of about $40 billion. So, on the supply side, there is much more bang for the buck in employing IDA equity at the World Bank than there was in employing AsDF equity at the AsDB. However, the demand side also differs, and here there is less certainty. The composition of borrowers&#8212;those requiring concessional lending terms and their size relative to non-con- cessional borrowers&#8212;clearly differs between the two institu-tions. Nonetheless, we can draw some firm conclusions even with this limited information. Some leveraging of IDA equity, whether through a full merger of IDA-IBRD balance sheets or something more limited, would generate additional financing capacity, including additional concessional financing capacity. This implies that at the same level of IDA donor contributions </span></div><div left="48.0" right="548.12" top="637.66"><span x0="48.0" y0="637.66" x1="548.12" style="x0: 48.0; x1: 74.67; y0: 637.66; y1: 667.66; width: 26.67; font-size: 30.0; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Light;">MDB balance sheet optimization: The Asian Development Bank case and its implications for the World Bank</span></div><div left="48.0" right="152.84" top="677.52"><span x0="48.0" y0="677.52" x1="152.84" style="x0: 48.0; x1: 62.08; y0: 677.52; y1: 697.52; width: 14.08; font-size: 20.0; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Medium;">Appendix 2</span></div><div left="191.15" right="411.84" top="516.34"><span x0="191.15" y0="516.34" x1="411.84" style="x0: 191.15; x1: 198.3; y0: 516.34; y1: 527.34; width: 7.15; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro-It;">Table A2.1: Equity stock of the World Bank and AsDB</span></div><div left="332.7" right="495.62" top="498.8"><span x0="332.7" y0="498.8" x1="495.62" style="x0: 332.7; x1: 339.2; y0: 498.8; y1: 507.8; width: 6.5; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Heavy;">AsDBWorld Bank</span></div><div left="52.15" right="167.9" top="483.65"><span x0="52.15" y0="483.65" x1="167.9" style="x0: 52.15; x1: 58.49; y0: 483.65; y1: 492.65; width: 6.34; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-BookOblique;">Concessional window equity</span><span x0="332.7" y0="483.65" x1="491.72" style="x0: 332.7; x1: 337.7; y0: 483.65; y1: 492.65; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Book;">$38 billion$175 billion</span></div><div left="52.15" right="152.96" top="468.84"><span x0="52.15" y0="468.84" x1="152.96" style="x0: 52.15; x1: 59.15; y0: 468.84; y1: 477.84; width: 7.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-BookOblique;">Non-concessional equity</span><span x0="332.7" y0="468.84" x1="488.36" style="x0: 332.7; x1: 337.7; y0: 468.84; y1: 477.84; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Book;">$17 billion$40 billion</span></div><div left="52.15" right="125.7" top="454.04"><span x0="52.15" y0="454.04" x1="125.7" style="x0: 52.15; x1: 58.49; y0: 454.04; y1: 463.04; width: 6.34; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-BookOblique;">Combined equity </span><span x0="332.7" y0="454.04" x1="492.42" style="x0: 332.7; x1: 337.7; y0: 454.04; y1: 463.04; width: 5.0; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Book;">$55 billion$215 billion</span></div><div left="49.79" right="199.16" top="427.45"><span x0="49.79" y0="427.45" x1="199.16" style="x0: 49.79; x1: 54.05; y0: 427.45; y1: 436.45; width: 4.26; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0.8]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 0.8]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">Source: AsDB, World Bank annual reports.</span></div></body></html>
