I fully endorse the ambition of the CDG to launch such a public discussion and would hope that this effort might prompt others to do the same. While the report raises many new ideas and questions, I am unable to endorse the content of the paper in its entirety but rather suggest that a number of these proposed ideas are worthy of further research and debate. My principal areas of concern are as follows. In considering the state of international development today, it is critical to speak not just about poverty or growth, but also about the growing inequalities between and within countries. The Bank, Fund, and World Economic Forum all acknowl-edge the widening gap between rich and poor, its impact on growth, and its detriment to the achievement of sustainable development. We simply cannot ignore the programs, policies, and structures that are accelerating the widening of such gaps. I think this perspective needs to be underlined more force-fully in any further discussion on the future of the MDBs. One of the reasons we are having this discussion today is the changing landscape of development: new national, regional, and international financial players, a bigger role for the private sector, and lively discussion on impact investing, etc. What separates the MDBs in this fast-changing context, however, is their specific mandate to reduce poverty. I therefore believe that it is imperative that the starting point for any such dis-cussion on the future of the MDBs acknowledge up front the centrality of the poverty reduction mandates to the vision and purpose of the MDBs. While I would certainly recognize the role of global public goods (GPGs) in addressing different dimensions of poverty and inequality (and might go so far as to suggest including the area of international tax regulation, </span></div><div left="307.5" right="557.22" top="517.3"><span x0="307.5" y0="517.3" x1="557.22" style="x0: 307.5; x1: 311.87; y0: 517.3; y1: 528.3; width: 4.37; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">and major pillar of work, I would continue to argue that the overarching mission and mandate of the World Bank (and other MDBs) must remain the fight to eliminate extreme poverty.Among its recommendations, the paper proposes that the World Bank should increase its focus on the GPGs and that when it comes to standard country operations, donors should concentrate future resources on regional banks. When viewed from an aid effectiveness (OECD Busan agreements) and a proximity standpoint, this could make sense. However, each of the legacy MDBs has developed unique competencies and organizational cultures. If we consider the added value of each institution, where their strengths and technical expertise lie, the relationships they have, particularly with donors and governments, and ultimately the capacity and experience they each have built up over time, such a change in focus (which could arguably entail the World Bank doing increasingly fewer country operations) may not be easy or optimal. It may make more sense to build on existing added value and the invest-ments built up over decades. We also have to recognize how challenging it is to change institutions, their cultures, their staffing, and the expectations that their development partners have of them. Finally, I&#8217;d like to comment on an issue which came up throughout the paper both implicitly and explicitly&#8212;the subject of environmental and social safeguards. The paper presents safeguards as a burdensome, costly process which has frustrated borrowing countries. What is not highlighted is that these policies are considered by many constituencies, not just NGOs but companies and even the investment com-munity, to be one of the MDBs&#8217; most significant added values. Increasingly, strong environmental and social outcomes are being seen as development outcomes in themselves&#8212;especially </span></div><div left="48.0" right="543.53" top="637.66"><span x0="48.0" y0="637.66" x1="543.53" style="x0: 48.0; x1: 71.34; y0: 637.66; y1: 667.66; width: 23.34; font-size: 30.0; fill: [1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Light;">Note of dissent from Ray Offenheiser </span></div></body></html>
