In this appendix, we explain what we mean by DR-GPGs and set out examples of a subset of DR-GPGs in which the MDBs could play a greater role. The subset is in four devel- opment areas in which many potential programs and invest-ments have substantial global spillovers&#8212;health, agriculture, climate/energy, and development policy research)&#8212;and on which the multilateral development banks and especially the World Bank have substantial competence. We offer rough estimates of annual spending by official funders on these DR-GPGs in the last decade and provide a brief history of support for DR-GPGs at the World Bank to those four areas. (See Appendix 2 for a discussion of how a broader and clearer mandate on DR-GPGs could be financed at the World Bank.)</span></div><div left="48.0" right="246.35" top="236.77"><span x0="48.0" y0="236.77" x1="246.35" style="x0: 48.0; x1: 59.67; y0: 236.77; y1: 251.77; width: 11.67; font-size: 15.0; fill: [1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Medium;">Global public goods that are development-relevant</span></div><div left="48.0" right="297.71" top="195.3"><span x0="48.0" y0="195.3" x1="297.71" style="x0: 48.0; x1: 53.99; y0: 195.3; y1: 206.3; width: 5.99; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">Public goods are defined as those that are non-excludable (no single provider can capture all the benefits of provision) and non-rivalrous (more for me does not imply less for you). Theory suggests that public goods (policing, pollution control, immu-nizations, management of public parks, some forms of social insurance) likely are inadequately provided and financed, espe- cially where collective agreement is hard to reach because gov-ernments are weak and unable to tax citizens adequately to provide such goods, or are otherwise dysfunctional in reaching </span></div><div left="307.5" right="557.15" top="517.3"><span x0="307.5" y0="517.3" x1="557.15" style="x0: 307.5; x1: 311.87; y0: 517.3; y1: 528.3; width: 4.37; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">and maintaining an adequate consensus on the provision of such goods.</span><span x0="355.56" y0="508.08" x1="361.96" style="x0: 355.56; x1: 358.76; y0: 508.08; y1: 514.68; width: 3.21; font-size: 6.6; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">71</span></div><div left="319.5" right="557.19" top="489.3"><span x0="319.5" y0="489.3" x1="557.19" style="x0: 319.5; x1: 330.36; y0: 489.3; y1: 500.3; width: 10.86; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">Whatever the challenge of providing public goods at the local and national levels, that challenge is greater (and thus even less likely to be met) in achieving optimal provision and financing of such goods at the global level&#8212;the provision of global public goods. Few would argue, for example, that financing climate mitigation programs is adequate, let alone optimal for the world at the moment, relative to provision and financing of national security in most countries. Some global public goods (and bads) are particularly impor-tant for developing countries and their people.

For example, the protection of sea trade lanes that undergirds the global trading system and United Nations peacekeeping operations are outside of their remit, and thus their competence. However, in sectors such as health, energy, and agriculture, MDB staff are familiar with the full range of technical and economic issues that matter for the provision of DR-GPG products and programs because of their main-stream activity: developing and financing country operations. </span></div><div left="307.5" right="370.94" top="69.98"><span x0="307.5" y0="69.98" x1="370.94" style="x0: 307.5; x1: 311.87; y0: 69.98; y1: 78.98; width: 4.37; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 0.8]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">71.
