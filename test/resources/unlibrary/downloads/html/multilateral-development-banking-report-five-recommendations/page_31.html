Most but not all remaining low-income countries eligible for concessional finance are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Currently the World Bank&#8217;s concessional fund, IDA, devotes 50 per-cent of its annual financing to Africa (or roughly $8 billion), making it the largest source of concessional resources to the region.</span><span x0="75.99" y0="270.08" x1="82.3" style="x0: 75.99; x1: 79.16; y0: 270.08; y1: 276.68; width: 3.17; font-size: 6.6; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">57</span><span x0="83.96" y0="265.3" x1="295.5" style="x0: 83.96; x1: 95.36; y0: 265.3; y1: 276.3; width: 11.4; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">The African Development Bank&#8217;s concessional fund- ing is about $2.25 billion a year.</span><span x0="179.51" y0="256.08" x1="186.01" style="x0: 179.51; x1: 182.72; y0: 256.08; y1: 262.68; width: 3.21; font-size: 6.6; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">58</span></div><div left="60.0" right="297.7" top="237.3"><span x0="60.0" y0="237.3" x1="297.7" style="x0: 60.0; x1: 67.44; y0: 237.3; y1: 248.3; width: 7.44; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">As a group, low-income countries that still need access to concessional finance can be presumed to face particularly tough constraints to growth inherent in their endowments, their politics, their history, or their neighborhoods. Sustain-ing the kind of patient, long-run support for these countries is not easy politically, given the likelihood of repeated setbacks over several decades. It can be argued that the role of the MDBs (along with the IMF) in supporting macroeconomic management and reforms in those countries has been constructive.

It is also the case that concessional finance and other aid have played a critical role in saving and improving lives by financing access to vaccines and other critical medicines and supporting the build-up of health and education systems. However, it is also difficult, beyond debt relief, to associate MDB (and bilateral) financ-ing with recent growth of some low-income countries&#8212;as opposed to a benign external environment and good domestic leadership in those countries. The bottom line: it is too soon to consider a diminution in the MDBs&#8217; financing role (and in other forms of external financial support) for many of these countries, but it also is unacceptable to view the MDB role in terms of business as usual. The MDBs have too often struggled to demonstrate suc- cesses in the poorest countries, often defined by conflict situa-tions and other sources of fragility. In part, they are bound by overly-rigid financing rules and silos that favor performance at the country level over responsiveness to immediate needs and opportunities&#8212;whether the risk posed by a fast-moving pandemic or the opportunity represented in a newly-elected democratic government in a country that has struggled with civil conflict. MDB successes in the poorest countries have also been limited due to the staff incentives that favor work in large borrower countries&#8212;such as the emerging markets&#8212; over work in small and poor countries.</span></div><div left="307.5" right="460.52" top="110.77"><span x0="307.5" y0="110.77" x1="460.52" style="x0: 307.5; x1: 319.98; y0: 110.77; y1: 125.77; width: 12.48; font-size: 15.0; fill: [1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+AvenirLTStd-Medium;">Our recommendations</span></div><div left="307.5" right="555.0" top="83.3"><span x0="307.5" y0="83.3" x1="555.0" style="x0: 307.5; x1: 315.93; y0: 83.3; y1: 94.3; width: 8.43; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0, 1]; stroke: [0, 0, 0, 1]; font-family: HZRYXC+GaramondPremrPro;">Our recommendations come in three parts.
