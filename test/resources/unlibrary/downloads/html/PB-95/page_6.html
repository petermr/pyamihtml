We had the deepest economic recession since World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic impact will last for a long period of time. The developed countries are having the second round of stimulus. The developing countries are having even smaller fiscal space but higher debt level because of the pandemic. As a result, the discussion of the reform of the international debt ar- chitecture was intensive then. Now, owing to fiscal stimu-lus in developed and a few emerging economies as well as to liquidity support (though not sufficient) from multilat-eral financial institutions and the good policies adopted by developing countries, the situation has improved mar-ginally for most of the developing countries.  Even though debt problems are still severe and the pandemic has not been brought under control, the world has averted a sys- temic debt crisis. With it, the desire to reform internation-al debt architecture has tapered to a great extent. The IMF seems to have toned down from &#8220;reform of the interna- tional debt architecture urgently needed&#8221; to &#8220; &#8230;this exist- ing contractual framework has been largely effec-tive&#8230;.there is a need to strengthen the international debt &#8220;architecture&#8221;&#8221;</span><span x0="367.68" y0="360.93" x1="373.88" style="x0: 367.68; x1: 370.74; y0: 360.93; y1: 367.05; width: 3.06; font-size: 6.12; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">19</span><span x0="373.92" y0="357.83" x1="552.24" style="x0: 373.92; x1: 376.29; y0: 357.83; y1: 367.31; width: 2.37; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">.  Both the IMF and the World Bank are talking about the importance of collective action clauses (CACs). There is a lot of complacency. But we know we are not out of the woods yet.

The Rapid Credit Facility (RCF), which is under the PRGT, has been used as the IMF&#8217;s emergency financing facility during the pandemic and has not charged interests and has no conditionality but it has to be repaid within 10 years (grace period of 5&#189; years, and a final maturity of 10 years.) </span></div><div left="57.26" right="283.82" top="599.44"><span x0="57.26" y0="599.44" x1="283.82" style="x0: 57.26; x1: 63.08; y0: 599.44; y1: 608.92; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">The existing rules do not oblige the IMF to be the only institution to have the responsibility for recycling the donated SDRs.
