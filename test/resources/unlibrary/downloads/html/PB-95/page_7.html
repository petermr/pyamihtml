Even though this would require an amend-ment of the IMF&#8217;s Articles of Agreement, the pandemic makes many people feel that we should not wait for an-other crisis to renew this wish to have such a mechanism. If this continues to be an impasse, there is the expressed desire to resort to Chapter VII of the UN Charter to pro- vide temporary protection of the assets belonging to sov-ereigns as it happened in the case of Iraq in 2003 when the UN Security Council passed a resolution. Debt cancella-tion would also be required for countries in debt distress as past experiences have shown that it would be difficult for insolvent countries to grow out of the debt trap, in particular currently no one knows when the world econo-my can restore to its pre-COVID form.  </span></div><div left="318.46" right="550.59" top="581.92"><span x0="318.46" y0="581.92" x1="550.59" style="x0: 318.46; x1: 324.27; y0: 581.92; y1: 591.4; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">The IMF quota system needs to be further reformed. There should be a standing mechanism to re-channel the unused SDRs to countries which need it. The mechanism should not be based on GDP per capita but should be based on countries&#8217; urgency of need for liquidity. It should be allocated without conditionality, with no cost, and should not be considered as ODA. It should not be housed entirely in the IMF.  Special-purpose facilities could be formulated. However, it would be good to set up a special purpose fund because the PRGT is tailored to LICs, while the recycled funds are for countries in need including middle-income countries. In addition, borrow- ing from PRGT requires IMF poverty alleviation pro-grammes.  </span></div><div left="316.06" right="550.58" top="410.63"><span x0="316.06" y0="410.63" x1="550.58" style="x0: 316.06; x1: 321.87; y0: 410.63; y1: 420.11; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">The nightmare scenario of a systemic global debt crisis seems to have been averted, yet the COVID-19 pandemic will have a long lasting negative impact.

The 2017 General Assembly debt paper point out that &#8220;(T)he danger at present is the mismatch between the very gradual, market-based reform of debt and finan-cial instruments, on the one hand, and the growing urgency of sovereign debt vulnerabilities and distress in developing countries, on the other.&#8221;</span><span x0="208.03" y0="685.49" x1="214.21" style="x0: 208.03; x1: 211.09; y0: 685.49; y1: 691.61; width: 3.06; font-size: 6.12; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">22</span></div><div left="59.42" right="282.65" top="664.63"><span x0="59.42" y0="664.63" x1="282.65" style="x0: 59.42; x1: 65.24; y0: 664.63; y1: 674.11; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">The IMF paper also highlighted the need to have further reform of the debt architecture including tools that could be activated at short notice which includes reform of statutory nature which goes beyond the spo-radic national laws to include international laws that would immunize assets from being snapped up by predatory creditors. Various temporary policy measures taken by the G20 and IMF have also been impeded in several ways by the existing weak links in the debt system.  Without a reform, the incremental contractual improvements cannot address these prob- lems.

Debt standstill should cover all countries being hit hardest and facing risks of debt dis-tress. The objective is not to allow debt servicing to mop up the limited financial resources of crisis-struck countries with heavy burden and leave them with no money to fight the crisis.  A GDP per capita based debt standstill would not be sufficient. Contractual improve- ments can also come to the rescue, for instance state-contingent sovereign debt like GDP linked bonds and a force majeure clause which will serve countries in times of natural calamities.  </span></div><div left="59.42" right="282.67" top="175.63"><span x0="59.42" y0="175.63" x1="282.67" style="x0: 59.42; x1: 66.15; y0: 175.63; y1: 185.11; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">Credit rating agencies need to undergo reform and should be included in the equation of international debt architecture as they affect the implementation of debt relief.
