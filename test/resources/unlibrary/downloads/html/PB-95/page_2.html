Following is a brief analysis of these initiatives.  </span></div><div left="303.34" right="550.19" top="423.53"><span x0="303.34" y0="423.53" x1="550.19" style="x0: 303.34; x1: 310.18; y0: 423.53; y1: 433.01; width: 6.84; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua,BoldItalic;">A. IMF grants for servicing IMF debt and emergency lend-ing </span></div><div left="303.34" right="550.28" top="394.31"><span x0="303.34" y0="394.31" x1="550.28" style="x0: 303.34; x1: 310.06; y0: 394.31; y1: 403.79; width: 6.72; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">Credit should be given to the IMF for being the first mov-er in providing debt service relief during the pandemic.  In April 2020, the IMF announced that it would provide grants through the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to 29 of its poorest and most vulnerable Member Countries to cover interest and principal payment of these countries&#8217; eligible IMF debt falling due. The duration was originally 6 months and subsequently has been extended to the current two years. The purpose is to help these poor countries to channel more of their scarce financial re- sources towards vital emergency medical and other pan-demic relief efforts.  The World Bank, however, refused to join the IMF on the ground that it could jeopardize its AAA credit rating and limit or make its financing more expensive in the future.</span><span x0="404.88" y0="232.15" x1="407.94" style="x0: 404.88; x1: 407.94; y0: 232.15; y1: 238.27; width: 3.06; font-size: 6.12; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">2</span><span x0="411.12" y0="229.05" x1="552.09" style="x0: 411.12; x1: 419.01; y0: 229.05; y1: 238.53; width: 7.89; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">However, we have not seen any downgrading of the IMF&#8217;s rating after its suspension of debt service payments.   </span></div><div left="314.62" right="552.52" top="187.51"><span x0="314.62" y0="187.51" x1="552.52" style="x0: 314.62; x1: 319.89; y0: 187.51; y1: 196.99; width: 5.27; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">For countries which are deemed as having sustainable debt, thus not qualified for debt service relief but have been hard hit by the pandemic, they can also apply to a number of IMF financing facilities including emergency financing. Most of the IMF developing Member Countries have asked for emergency financial assistance from the IMF.  This is not a new phenomenon but worth mention-ing as it could facilitate countries in times of crisis though the amount is not sufficient. </span></div><div left="303.34" right="481.91" top="75.61"><span x0="303.34" y0="75.61" x1="481.91" style="x0: 303.34; x1: 309.66; y0: 75.61; y1: 85.09; width: 6.32; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua,BoldItalic;">B. G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative </span></div><div left="45.98" right="284.05" top="753.07"><span x0="45.98" y0="753.07" x1="284.05" style="x0: 45.98; x1: 49.07; y0: 753.07; y1: 762.55; width: 3.09; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">ticipated in international initiatives for temporary debt service relief.  On the other hand, middle-income coun-tries have the lion&#8217;s share of risky debt and many have been hard hit by the pandemic, yet they seem to have fallen into the gap and they are neither qualified for debt service suspension nor concessional lending as the criteria for these benefits are based on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita even during the pandemic.  Therefore, debt service relief of bilateral official debt of low-income countries and (insufficient) liquidity provi- sion would only have limited impact on the debt prob- lem of developing countries. Even though the night-mare scenario of systemic debt crisis may have been averted, the debt mountain would not disappear and will be a major obstacle for &#8220;building back better and greener&#8221;, not to mention achieving the Sustainable De-velopment Goals (SDGs). Without addressing systemic gaps of the international debt architecture, temporary measures to mitigate the debt burden of some countries can only be &#8220;band-aid&#8221; solutions.  </span></div><div left="45.98" right="281.41" top="509.89"><span x0="45.98" y0="509.89" x1="281.41" style="x0: 45.98; x1: 49.44; y0: 509.89; y1: 520.93; width: 3.46; font-size: 11.04; font-family: ABCDEE+Arial Rounded MT Bold;">I. Temporary liquidity boost is not tanta-mount to systemic reform </span></div><div left="45.98" right="283.92" top="479.54"><span x0="45.98" y0="479.54" x1="283.92" style="x0: 45.98; x1: 49.18; y0: 479.54; y1: 489.02; width: 3.19; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">It is important to point out that the measures taken by international financial institutions (IFIs) and the Group of Twenty (G20) so far have been mostly for liquidity provision on a temporary basis and they are not tanta-mount to systemic reform. This is not to say liquidity support is not important. On the contrary, faced with a dire situation of collapsing health systems, sudden fall in GDP growth, shrinking revenue, sharp decline of international trade, sudden-stop of tourism and many other woes, liquidity provision is an important option to provide new though limited financial resources to developing countries to increase fire power to protect lives and livelihood in the face of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic and also prevent countries with liquidity problem from sinking into an insolvency trap. Alleviat- ing debt service burden can increase and free up gov- ernments&#8217; financial resources to meet exceptional bal-ance of payments needs caused by the pandemic so that crisis-struck countries would be able to focus on containing the crisis and minimizing the negative im- pact of the pandemic. To reduce the number of default-ing countries would certainly minimize the likelihood of a systemic debt crisis which would lead to global financial instability and worsen human suffering dur-ing the pandemic.  </span></div><div left="57.02" right="283.79" top="178.27"><span x0="57.02" y0="178.27" x1="283.79" style="x0: 57.02; x1: 64.91; y0: 178.27; y1: 187.75; width: 7.89; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">However, measures taken so far are time bound and targeted at low-income countries (LICs). LICs are in-deed vulnerable. Prior to the pandemic 44% of LICs were in debt distress or high risk of debt distress while now the percentage has increased to 55% (See Figure 1. Adapted from the Financial Times.).  However, initia-tives to reduce debt service burden of LICs have not introduced new norms or new rules e.g. no new ele-ments for debt standstill during crisis or calamity or rules to oblige private creditor participation etc. Nei-</span></div></body></html>
