The COVID-19 pandemic is no different. For countries with little fiscal space to maneuver, they certainly cannot mount need-ed fiscal response to fight the pandemic. Meanwhile, as a result of increasing expenditure and collapsing reve-nue, public debt has increased drastically in developing countries, both low-income and middle-income ones. Many of these countries had entered the pandemic with a high debt burden.

In April 2020, the IMF announced that it would provide grants through the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to 29 of its poorest and most vulnerable Member Countries to cover interest and principal payment of these countries&#8217; eligible IMF debt falling due. The duration was originally 6 months and subsequently has been extended to the current two years. The purpose is to help these poor countries to channel more of their scarce financial re- sources towards vital emergency medical and other pan-demic relief efforts.  The World Bank, however, refused to join the IMF on the ground that it could jeopardize its AAA credit rating and limit or make its financing more expensive in the future.</span><span x0="404.88" y0="232.15" x1="407.94" style="x0: 404.88; x1: 407.94; y0: 232.15; y1: 238.27; width: 3.06; font-size: 6.12; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">2</span><span x0="411.12" y0="229.05" x1="552.09" style="x0: 411.12; x1: 419.01; y0: 229.05; y1: 238.53; width: 7.89; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">However, we have not seen any downgrading of the IMF&#8217;s rating after its suspension of debt service payments.   </span></div><div left="314.62" right="552.52" top="187.51"><span x0="314.62" y0="187.51" x1="552.52" style="x0: 314.62; x1: 319.89; y0: 187.51; y1: 196.99; width: 5.27; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">For countries which are deemed as having sustainable debt, thus not qualified for debt service relief but have been hard hit by the pandemic, they can also apply to a number of IMF financing facilities including emergency financing. Most of the IMF developing Member Countries have asked for emergency financial assistance from the IMF.

On the other hand, middle-income coun-tries have the lion&#8217;s share of risky debt and many have been hard hit by the pandemic, yet they seem to have fallen into the gap and they are neither qualified for debt service suspension nor concessional lending as the criteria for these benefits are based on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita even during the pandemic.  Therefore, debt service relief of bilateral official debt of low-income countries and (insufficient) liquidity provi- sion would only have limited impact on the debt prob- lem of developing countries. Even though the night-mare scenario of systemic debt crisis may have been averted, the debt mountain would not disappear and will be a major obstacle for &#8220;building back better and greener&#8221;, not to mention achieving the Sustainable De-velopment Goals (SDGs). Without addressing systemic gaps of the international debt architecture, temporary measures to mitigate the debt burden of some countries can only be &#8220;band-aid&#8221; solutions.  </span></div><div left="45.98" right="281.41" top="509.89"><span x0="45.98" y0="509.89" x1="281.41" style="x0: 45.98; x1: 49.44; y0: 509.89; y1: 520.93; width: 3.46; font-size: 11.04; font-family: ABCDEE+Arial Rounded MT Bold;">I.

This is not to say liquidity support is not important. On the contrary, faced with a dire situation of collapsing health systems, sudden fall in GDP growth, shrinking revenue, sharp decline of international trade, sudden-stop of tourism and many other woes, liquidity provision is an important option to provide new though limited financial resources to developing countries to increase fire power to protect lives and livelihood in the face of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic and also prevent countries with liquidity problem from sinking into an insolvency trap. Alleviat- ing debt service burden can increase and free up gov- ernments&#8217; financial resources to meet exceptional bal-ance of payments needs caused by the pandemic so that crisis-struck countries would be able to focus on containing the crisis and minimizing the negative im- pact of the pandemic. To reduce the number of default-ing countries would certainly minimize the likelihood of a systemic debt crisis which would lead to global financial instability and worsen human suffering dur-ing the pandemic.  </span></div><div left="57.02" right="283.79" top="178.27"><span x0="57.02" y0="178.27" x1="283.79" style="x0: 57.02; x1: 64.91; y0: 178.27; y1: 187.75; width: 7.89; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">However, measures taken so far are time bound and targeted at low-income countries (LICs). LICs are in-deed vulnerable. Prior to the pandemic 44% of LICs were in debt distress or high risk of debt distress while now the percentage has increased to 55% (See Figure 1. Adapted from the Financial Times.).

So it is kicking the can down the road and not a relief at all. Nonetheless, it is helpful, as countries do not have to pay during the agreed time period when the pandemic is still not yet under con-trol.

The size of external debt of MICs was more than 38 times that of the LICs for the year 2020. Their unsustainable debt is also much larger. The current financial fire power of the IMF and the World Bank as well as the current poli-cy tools do not seem to be well equipped to cope with the debt problems of these countries at such a large scale and with a complex composition of debt. Once again, this proves the need to reform the international debt architec-ture, so these countries would not be left alone to fight the pandemic by themselves.  </span></div><div left="313.78" right="550.59" top="304.29"><span x0="313.78" y0="304.29" x1="550.59" style="x0: 313.78; x1: 321.16; y0: 304.29; y1: 313.77; width: 7.38; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">A United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study</span><span x0="326.38" y0="295.63" x1="329.44" style="x0: 326.38; x1: 329.44; y0: 295.63; y1: 301.75; width: 3.06; font-size: 6.12; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">6</span><span x0="332.26" y0="292.53" x1="550.66" style="x0: 332.26; x1: 335.02; y0: 292.53; y1: 302.01; width: 2.76; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">identified the total debt-service payment at risk for the period of 2021 to 2025 for long term public and public guaranteed debt and noted that LICs account for only 6% of the full period for risky debt-service payment; lower middle income countries (LMICs) account for 49%; and </span></div><div left="45.86" right="282.54" top="753.19"><span x0="45.86" y0="753.19" x1="282.54" style="x0: 45.86; x1: 49.02; y0: 753.19; y1: 762.67; width: 3.16; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">from May 2020. It applies only to official bilateral debt for 73 low-income developing countries that are either eligible to borrow from the International Development Association (IDA) or are least developed countries. It is also time bound which was 6 months at the beginning and is currently expected to finish by end December 2021 unless further extended. The initiative does not change at all contractual terms of private debt though it invites the private creditors to join on voluntary terms, which means private participation will not take place as the private creditors do not have the habit of joining debt relief on a voluntary basis. Up to now, no private creditor has volunteered. This shows one systemic gap of the debt architecture, namely different kinds of cred-itors normally would not coordinate voluntarily and private creditor participation has always been difficult as there are no instruments to legally bind them. There-fore, despite the debt service relief by the IMF and the DSSI by the G20, debtors continue to pay private credi-tors on time during the pandemic for fear of reputation loss. Where does the money come from when revenue earning by many governments has been almost dried up and pandemic related expenditure skyrocketed?  It would not be surprising if some of the money comes from debt service suspension or multilateral emergency lending, which is outright free riding for private credi-tors.  </span></div><div left="57.14" right="282.66" top="428.42"><span x0="57.14" y0="428.42" x1="282.66" style="x0: 57.14; x1: 64.52; y0: 428.42; y1: 437.9; width: 7.38; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">Another systemic problem in the debt architecture exposed by the DSSI is the role of credit rating agen- cies. As credit rating plays a dominant role in deter-mining a country's accessibility to the international credit market, the DSSI-eligible countries, though hit hard by the pandemic, would have to calculate the cost and benefits of joining DSSI and decide whether to join.  The DSSI initiative had a slow start because countries are afraid of the possible prospect of credit rating downgrades which would negatively affect their repu-tation at the international capital market.   As of May 2021, 47 out of the 73 eligible countries have requested participation in the DSSI.</span><span x0="151.49" y0="289.75" x1="156.14" style="x0: 151.49; x1: 154.55; y0: 289.75; y1: 295.87; width: 3.06; font-size: 6.12; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">3 </span></div><div left="57.14" right="280.28" top="268.89"><span x0="57.14" y0="268.89" x1="280.28" style="x0: 57.14; x1: 64.48; y0: 268.89; y1: 278.37; width: 7.34; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">DSSI is not debt relief per se.

Under the Common Framework, eligible coun- tries can also apply for debt restructuring for their unsus-tainable sovereign debt in addition to benefiting from debt service suspension. For countries with debt deemed as sustainable, they could have debt rescheduling (debt re-profiling) which defers the debt payment for an agreed duration. The private sector is supposed to provide debt relief comparable with the official debt, meaning not less favorable than the treatment from official bilateral credi- tors towards debtor countries. It is not on a voluntary ba-sis like DSSI, but it is required.   However, there exists no supranational legal mechanism to compel the private sec-tor to participate in the Common Framework, which means their involvement remains to be seen. The most ground-breaking element of the Common Framework is that some non-Paris Club G20 official creditor countries including China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have agreed to join the initiative.  Like DSSI, the Common Framework is a welcome step forward. However, once again the heavily indebted and pandemic hard hit middle- income countries are not eligible for the Common Frame-work. </span></div><div left="314.62" right="552.52" top="180.79"><span x0="314.62" y0="180.79" x1="552.52" style="x0: 314.62; x1: 320.43; y0: 180.79; y1: 190.27; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">The operation of the Common Framework follows the template of the debt relief and rescheduling of the Paris Club with the IMF and the World Bank playing a very important role. Debt owed to the IMF and the World Bank would not be touched on the ground that they need to retain their preferred creditor status.

Regarding private debt of mid-dle-income countries, it amounted to US$ 2,081 billion in 2020 while low-income countries only had US$ 14 billion (see Table 1).  It is not surprising as they are hardest hit by the pandemic and also entered the pan-demic with high levels of debt. An examination of the per capita GDP loss of countries by the IMF reveals that the income losses are the highest for emerging econo- mies (see also Figure 2.) This shows that the debt prob- lem of the middle-income countries should be ad-dressed.

However, there is no existing mechanism for this kind of transfer. Meanwhile, the IMF has a set of de- tailed rules for governing the use of SDRs. Its special ac-counting system for SDRs and the desire to retain the SDR&#8217;s international reserve currency status in the global economy have made such kind of transfer a complex is-sue. </span></div><div left="316.18" right="548.21" top="398.63"><span x0="316.18" y0="398.63" x1="548.21" style="x0: 316.18; x1: 324.06; y0: 398.63; y1: 408.11; width: 7.88; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">Nevertheless, the new SDR allocation creates an op-portunity to formulate a workable mechanism to allow donated SDRs to be rechanneled to countries in urgent need of unconditional liquidity.

This concern is more relevant for the Common Framework than that for DSSI as in the case of the former, comparable treatment by private credi-tors has been requested instead of being voluntary.

This is going to be the largest new issuance of SDR since they were created in 1969. The new issuance is a truly non-debt creating ad-ditional financial resources for countries.

We had the deepest economic recession since World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic impact will last for a long period of time. The developed countries are having the second round of stimulus. The developing countries are having even smaller fiscal space but higher debt level because of the pandemic. As a result, the discussion of the reform of the international debt ar- chitecture was intensive then. Now, owing to fiscal stimu-lus in developed and a few emerging economies as well as to liquidity support (though not sufficient) from multilat-eral financial institutions and the good policies adopted by developing countries, the situation has improved mar-ginally for most of the developing countries.

Even though this would require an amend-ment of the IMF&#8217;s Articles of Agreement, the pandemic makes many people feel that we should not wait for an-other crisis to renew this wish to have such a mechanism. If this continues to be an impasse, there is the expressed desire to resort to Chapter VII of the UN Charter to pro- vide temporary protection of the assets belonging to sov-ereigns as it happened in the case of Iraq in 2003 when the UN Security Council passed a resolution. Debt cancella-tion would also be required for countries in debt distress as past experiences have shown that it would be difficult for insolvent countries to grow out of the debt trap, in particular currently no one knows when the world econo-my can restore to its pre-COVID form.  </span></div><div left="318.46" right="550.59" top="581.92"><span x0="318.46" y0="581.92" x1="550.59" style="x0: 318.46; x1: 324.27; y0: 581.92; y1: 591.4; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">The IMF quota system needs to be further reformed. There should be a standing mechanism to re-channel the unused SDRs to countries which need it. The mechanism should not be based on GDP per capita but should be based on countries&#8217; urgency of need for liquidity. It should be allocated without conditionality, with no cost, and should not be considered as ODA. It should not be housed entirely in the IMF.  Special-purpose facilities could be formulated. However, it would be good to set up a special purpose fund because the PRGT is tailored to LICs, while the recycled funds are for countries in need including middle-income countries. In addition, borrow- ing from PRGT requires IMF poverty alleviation pro-grammes.  </span></div><div left="316.06" right="550.58" top="410.63"><span x0="316.06" y0="410.63" x1="550.58" style="x0: 316.06; x1: 321.87; y0: 410.63; y1: 420.11; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">The nightmare scenario of a systemic global debt crisis seems to have been averted, yet the COVID-19 pandemic will have a long lasting negative impact.
