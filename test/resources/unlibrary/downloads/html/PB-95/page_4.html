Under the Common Framework, eligible coun- tries can also apply for debt restructuring for their unsus-tainable sovereign debt in addition to benefiting from debt service suspension. For countries with debt deemed as sustainable, they could have debt rescheduling (debt re-profiling) which defers the debt payment for an agreed duration. The private sector is supposed to provide debt relief comparable with the official debt, meaning not less favorable than the treatment from official bilateral credi- tors towards debtor countries. It is not on a voluntary ba-sis like DSSI, but it is required.   However, there exists no supranational legal mechanism to compel the private sec-tor to participate in the Common Framework, which means their involvement remains to be seen. The most ground-breaking element of the Common Framework is that some non-Paris Club G20 official creditor countries including China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have agreed to join the initiative.  Like DSSI, the Common Framework is a welcome step forward. However, once again the heavily indebted and pandemic hard hit middle- income countries are not eligible for the Common Frame-work. </span></div><div left="314.62" right="552.52" top="180.79"><span x0="314.62" y0="180.79" x1="552.52" style="x0: 314.62; x1: 320.43; y0: 180.79; y1: 190.27; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">The operation of the Common Framework follows the template of the debt relief and rescheduling of the Paris Club with the IMF and the World Bank playing a very important role. Debt owed to the IMF and the World Bank would not be touched on the ground that they need to retain their preferred creditor status. But for LICs, in addi-tion to bilateral official debt, debt owed to multilateral creditors constitute an important part. The IMF debt ser-vice relief is far from sufficient.  </span></div><div left="314.62" right="552.6" top="68.56"><span x0="314.62" y0="68.56" x1="552.6" style="x0: 314.62; x1: 320.43; y0: 68.56; y1: 78.04; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">To initiate the process, the requesting country needs to </span></div><div left="45.98" right="283.85" top="447.02"><span x0="45.98" y0="447.02" x1="283.85" style="x0: 45.98; x1: 51.7; y0: 447.02; y1: 456.5; width: 5.72; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">upper middle income countries (UMICs) account for 45%. A large share of UMIC risky debt is rated &#8216;default current or imminent&#8217;.  Regarding private debt of mid-dle-income countries, it amounted to US$ 2,081 billion in 2020 while low-income countries only had US$ 14 billion (see Table 1).  It is not surprising as they are hardest hit by the pandemic and also entered the pan-demic with high levels of debt. An examination of the per capita GDP loss of countries by the IMF reveals that the income losses are the highest for emerging econo- mies (see also Figure 2.) This shows that the debt prob- lem of the middle-income countries should be ad-dressed. According to the World Bank, out of the 120 million additional people pushed into poverty as a re-sult of the pandemic, an estimated 82% are from the middle-income countries.</span><span x0="155.57" y0="273.07" x1="158.63" style="x0: 155.57; x1: 158.63; y0: 273.07; y1: 279.19; width: 3.06; font-size: 6.12; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">7</span><span x0="163.25" y0="269.97" x1="283.46" style="x0: 163.25; x1: 169.06; y0: 269.97; y1: 279.45; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">The data shows that these countries do need a helping hand, and that their ability to counter drastic external shocks cannot be compared with advanced economies.
