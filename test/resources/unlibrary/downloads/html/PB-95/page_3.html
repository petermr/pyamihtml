So it is kicking the can down the road and not a relief at all. Nonetheless, it is helpful, as countries do not have to pay during the agreed time period when the pandemic is still not yet under con-trol. They can divert the interest and principal payment to spend on pandemic control as well as economic recovery.  </span></div><div left="313.78" right="548.37" top="629.08"><span x0="313.78" y0="629.08" x1="548.37" style="x0: 313.78; x1: 321.12; y0: 629.08; y1: 638.56; width: 7.34; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">DSSI has also drawn complaints from the middle-income countries (MICs), many of which have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic and also have crushing debt burden. This category of countries has no access to concessional loans.The wooden treatment of the MICs during an unprecedented global pandemic and the deepest economic recession since World War II has drawn criticism from the MICs, academia and international insti- tutions</span><span x0="331.9" y0="534.78" x1="336.67" style="x0: 331.9; x1: 334.27; y0: 534.78; y1: 544.26; width: 2.37; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua,Bold;">. </span><span x0="338.38" y0="534.62" x1="548.26" style="x0: 338.38; x1: 344.19; y0: 534.62; y1: 544.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">This is another systemic problem of the interna-tional debt architecture.  Some institutions have already started to work on a vulnerability index which include more variables to decide the degree of vulnerability. At one webinar, theWorld Bank Chief Economist, Dr. Rein-hart, identified the realistic difficulties in addressing MIC debt issues, that is, their larger scale of debt as compared to the debt owed by LICs.</span><span x0="413.76" y0="455.16" x1="416.82" style="x0: 413.76; x1: 416.82; y0: 455.16; y1: 461.28; width: 3.06; font-size: 6.12; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">4</span><span x0="419.76" y0="452.06" x1="550.67" style="x0: 419.76; x1: 425.57; y0: 452.06; y1: 461.54; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">The following table shows the difference of scale of debt between the LICs and MICs.  The size of external debt of MICs was more than 38 times that of the LICs for the year 2020. Their unsustainable debt is also much larger. The current financial fire power of the IMF and the World Bank as well as the current poli-cy tools do not seem to be well equipped to cope with the debt problems of these countries at such a large scale and with a complex composition of debt. Once again, this proves the need to reform the international debt architec-ture, so these countries would not be left alone to fight the pandemic by themselves.  </span></div><div left="313.78" right="550.59" top="304.29"><span x0="313.78" y0="304.29" x1="550.59" style="x0: 313.78; x1: 321.16; y0: 304.29; y1: 313.77; width: 7.38; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">A United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study</span><span x0="326.38" y0="295.63" x1="329.44" style="x0: 326.38; x1: 329.44; y0: 295.63; y1: 301.75; width: 3.06; font-size: 6.12; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">6</span><span x0="332.26" y0="292.53" x1="550.66" style="x0: 332.26; x1: 335.02; y0: 292.53; y1: 302.01; width: 2.76; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">identified the total debt-service payment at risk for the period of 2021 to 2025 for long term public and public guaranteed debt and noted that LICs account for only 6% of the full period for risky debt-service payment; lower middle income countries (LMICs) account for 49%; and </span></div><div left="45.86" right="282.54" top="753.19"><span x0="45.86" y0="753.19" x1="282.54" style="x0: 45.86; x1: 49.02; y0: 753.19; y1: 762.67; width: 3.16; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">from May 2020. It applies only to official bilateral debt for 73 low-income developing countries that are either eligible to borrow from the International Development Association (IDA) or are least developed countries. It is also time bound which was 6 months at the beginning and is currently expected to finish by end December 2021 unless further extended. The initiative does not change at all contractual terms of private debt though it invites the private creditors to join on voluntary terms, which means private participation will not take place as the private creditors do not have the habit of joining debt relief on a voluntary basis. Up to now, no private creditor has volunteered. This shows one systemic gap of the debt architecture, namely different kinds of cred-itors normally would not coordinate voluntarily and private creditor participation has always been difficult as there are no instruments to legally bind them. There-fore, despite the debt service relief by the IMF and the DSSI by the G20, debtors continue to pay private credi-tors on time during the pandemic for fear of reputation loss. Where does the money come from when revenue earning by many governments has been almost dried up and pandemic related expenditure skyrocketed?  It would not be surprising if some of the money comes from debt service suspension or multilateral emergency lending, which is outright free riding for private credi-tors.  </span></div><div left="57.14" right="282.66" top="428.42"><span x0="57.14" y0="428.42" x1="282.66" style="x0: 57.14; x1: 64.52; y0: 428.42; y1: 437.9; width: 7.38; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">Another systemic problem in the debt architecture exposed by the DSSI is the role of credit rating agen- cies. As credit rating plays a dominant role in deter-mining a country's accessibility to the international credit market, the DSSI-eligible countries, though hit hard by the pandemic, would have to calculate the cost and benefits of joining DSSI and decide whether to join.  The DSSI initiative had a slow start because countries are afraid of the possible prospect of credit rating downgrades which would negatively affect their repu-tation at the international capital market.   As of May 2021, 47 out of the 73 eligible countries have requested participation in the DSSI.</span><span x0="151.49" y0="289.75" x1="156.14" style="x0: 151.49; x1: 154.55; y0: 289.75; y1: 295.87; width: 3.06; font-size: 6.12; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">3 </span></div><div left="57.14" right="280.28" top="268.89"><span x0="57.14" y0="268.89" x1="280.28" style="x0: 57.14; x1: 64.48; y0: 268.89; y1: 278.37; width: 7.34; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">DSSI is not debt relief per se.
