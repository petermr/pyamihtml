This means coun-tries which need SDRs most will be given the least and those which do not need them will have the most of it. For instance, the G7 countries combined hold quotas amount-ing to 43% of the Fund, equivalent to USD 283 billion out of a new issue of USD 650 billion while low-income coun-tries will have 3.2% of it (See chart below. Adapted from the Financial Times.).  </span></div><div left="313.78" right="548.19" top="587.68"><span x0="313.78" y0="587.68" x1="548.19" style="x0: 313.78; x1: 319.59; y0: 587.68; y1: 597.16; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">The IMF quota system is still under reform, an im-portant systemic reform for the international financial architecture including the international debt architecture, which is expected to increase the voice of developing countries in international financial affairs.   </span></div><div left="313.78" right="550.54" top="522.62"><span x0="313.78" y0="522.62" x1="550.54" style="x0: 313.78; x1: 321.16; y0: 522.62; y1: 532.1; width: 7.38; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">Alongside the request for new issuance of SDR, there has been the discussion about how to transfer the unused SDRs by advanced countries to vulnerable developing countries. However, there is no existing mechanism for this kind of transfer. Meanwhile, the IMF has a set of de- tailed rules for governing the use of SDRs. Its special ac-counting system for SDRs and the desire to retain the SDR&#8217;s international reserve currency status in the global economy have made such kind of transfer a complex is-sue. </span></div><div left="316.18" right="548.21" top="398.63"><span x0="316.18" y0="398.63" x1="548.21" style="x0: 316.18; x1: 324.06; y0: 398.63; y1: 408.11; width: 7.88; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">Nevertheless, the new SDR allocation creates an op-portunity to formulate a workable mechanism to allow donated SDRs to be rechanneled to countries in urgent need of unconditional liquidity.  For the moment, this task has been given to the IMF. The Communiqu&#233; of the sec-ond G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors&#8217; meeting of April 2021 stated that &#8220;(w)e also invite the IMF to present proposals to enhance transparency and ac-countability in the use of the SDRs while preserving the reserve asset characteristic of the SDRs. In parallel, we ask the IMF to explore options for members to channel SDRs on a voluntary basis to the benefit of vulnerable countries, </span></div><div left="45.86" right="282.67" top="753.19"><span x0="45.86" y0="753.19" x1="282.67" style="x0: 45.86; x1: 53.2; y0: 753.19; y1: 762.67; width: 7.34; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) to be conducted jointly by the IMF and World Bank. DSA has been un-der close scrutiny and criticized for its over-optimistic forecasts of economic prospects of debtor countries and lack of consideration of some important variables af-fecting debt sustainability.  The IMF would assess the country situation and decide on the size of the debt relief or the terms of debt rescheduling.  The debtor country must implement an IMF programme and cer-tain IMF defined policies or structural reforms.  </span></div><div left="57.14" right="282.62" top="629.08"><span x0="57.14" y0="629.08" x1="282.62" style="x0: 57.14; x1: 62.41; y0: 629.08; y1: 638.56; width: 5.27; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">From the signals given from the G20, it seems that a comprehensive debt restructuring under the Common Framework might not be the envisaged objective while debt rescheduling could be the main debt treatment under the Common Framework. The Statement at the Extraordinary G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors&#8217; meeting of 13 November 2020 indicated that &#8220;in principle, debt treatments will not be conduct- ed in the form of debt write-off or cancellation.&#8221;</span><span x0="253.15" y0="537.72" x1="256.21" style="x0: 253.15; x1: 256.21; y0: 537.72; y1: 543.84; width: 3.06; font-size: 6.12; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">9</span><span x0="262.51" y0="534.62" x1="282.88" style="x0: 262.51; x1: 268.32; y0: 534.62; y1: 544.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">This focus on extension of debt maturity and debt reduc-tion on NPV terms alone carries the risk of &#8220;too late and too little&#8221;.

The same concern with DSSI also looms over the Com-mon Framework, namely whether participating in the Common Framework would restrict access to borrow-ing in commercial markets or raise debt servicing costs down the road. This concern is more relevant for the Common Framework than that for DSSI as in the case of the former, comparable treatment by private credi-tors has been requested instead of being voluntary. Therefore, the risk of credit rating downgrades and/or deterioration in market reputation seems to be higher.  </span></div><div left="57.14" right="280.3" top="321.95"><span x0="57.14" y0="321.95" x1="280.3" style="x0: 57.14; x1: 62.12; y0: 321.95; y1: 331.43; width: 4.98; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua;">Some consider the Common Framework as a mile-stone in sovereign debt crisis resolution. But a close examination shows it is very much like old wine in a larger bottle. No systemic reform is included in the ele-ments of the Common Framework.  It is certainly not a comprehensive multilateral framework for debt crisis resolution as it deals predominantly with official bilat-eral debt and complex issues like bonds and holdout problem, etc. have not been addressed.  </span></div><div left="45.86" right="151.94" top="210.01"><span x0="45.86" y0="210.01" x1="151.94" style="x0: 45.86; x1: 53.76; y0: 210.01; y1: 219.49; width: 7.9; font-size: 9.48; font-family: ABCDEE+Book Antiqua,Bold;">D.

This is going to be the largest new issuance of SDR since they were created in 1969. The new issuance is a truly non-debt creating ad-ditional financial resources for countries. Comparing with the real needs of financial resources, as noted, DSSI and IMF emergency financing instruments are far from enough. According to the IMF estimates, LICs </span></div></body></html>
