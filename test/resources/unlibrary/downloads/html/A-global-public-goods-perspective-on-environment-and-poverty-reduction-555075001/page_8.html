A coherent strategy for international cooperation for global environmental issues and poverty reduction can be developed by answering three key questions: i) what does the Netherlands want to achieve through international cooperation; ii) what are the priorities in providing GPGs, and iii) what are the implications for the organisation of international cooperation?The answers to these questions are political and views will diverge; this paper is restricted to identifying some choices that need to be taken into account, arguing that international cooperation can benefit from the GPG </span></div><div left="275.3" right="473.83" top="694.2"><span x0="275.3" y0="694.2" x1="473.83" style="x0: 275.3; x1: 280.11; y0: 694.2; y1: 703.2; width: 4.81; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: RTUAHJ+RijksoverheidSansText-Regular;">perspective, as it makes common interests visible and identifies strategies to apply them to national and global policies. The different criteria identified in this paper can help show where different perspectives on international cooperation can meet. A tentative scoring of the relative importance of the issues from a GPG perspective is also proposed. The paper identifies choices with respect to the focus of these policies, in particular thematic choices, the need to link domestic and international policies, and the time dimension of these policies. The implications with respect to organisation are then addressed, in particular the choices to be made regarding policy coherence across sectors, country choice and geopolitics and the selection of channels and actors to make the organisation of international cooperation more effective and efficient. </span></div></body></html>
