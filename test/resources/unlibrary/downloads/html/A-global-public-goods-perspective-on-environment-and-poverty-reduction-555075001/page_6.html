To address these issues, foreign policies require a coherent policy agenda for sustainable poverty reduction and for dealing with global environmental change, both within the Netherlands and internationally. In this paper we explore the possible contribution of the global public good (GPG) perspective to the development of coherent Dutch policies for international cooperation on poverty reduction and the global environment. </span></div><div left="48.19" right="256.57" top="262.19"><span x0="48.19" y0="262.19" x1="256.57" style="x0: 48.19; x1: 56.01; y0: 262.19; y1: 271.19; width: 7.82; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: RTUAHJ+RijksoverheidSansText-Regular;">We specify why global public goods are of interest to the Netherlands for international cooperation, and what the policy choices are arising from taking a global public goods perspective on these issues.

Because of these characteristics, individual use cannot be adequately priced, free-riding occurs and markets typically fail in providing these goods. Policy interventions are therefore necessary to organise collective action, starting with agreements between actors involved to provide for specific public goods. The concept of public goods is relevant at different levels of decision-making and can therefore also be applied to issues of poverty reduction and global environmental management. Providing global public goods (GPGs) is particularly challenging as it requires cooperation and collective action involving many countries and stakeholders. Examples of global public goods are the protection of the ozone layer, peace and macro-economic stability. Development and poverty reduction rely, among other things, on the provisioning of environmental goods, some of which are public and global (e.g. a stable climate), others public and local (e.g. soil conservation), and yet others private (e.g. commodities). </span></div><div left="274.96" right="393.41" top="92.97"><span x0="274.96" y0="92.97" x1="393.41" style="x0: 274.96; x1: 282.53; y0: 92.97; y1: 106.97; width: 7.57; font-size: 14.0; fill: [1]; font-family: QLKUTL+RijksoverheidSerif-Regular;">Analytical framework</span></div><div left="274.96" right="484.66" top="70.16"><span x0="274.96" y0="70.16" x1="484.66" style="x0: 274.96; x1: 282.78; y0: 70.16; y1: 79.16; width: 7.82; font-size: 9.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: RTUAHJ+RijksoverheidSansText-Regular;">We developed a framework for the analysis of GPGs with </span></div></body></html>
