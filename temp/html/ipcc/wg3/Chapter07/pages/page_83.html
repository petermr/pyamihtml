While two of the 17 SDGs directly relate to nature (SDGs 14 and 15 covering marine and terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity), most other SDGs relating to poverty, hunger, inequality, health and well-being, clean sanitation and water, energy, and so on, are directly or indirectly linked to nature (Blicharska et al. 2019). A&#160;survey among experts to assess how 16 ecosystem services could help in achieving the SDGs relating to good environment and human well-being suggested that ecosystem services could contribute to achieving about 41 targets across 12 SDGs (Wood et al. 2018). They also indicated cross-target interactions and synergetic outcomes across many SDGs. Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services is critical to sustaining the well-being and livelihoods of poor and marginalised people, and indigenous communities who depend on natural resources (</span><span style="x0: 123.03; x1: 127.61; y0: 138.63; y1: 148.13; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="123.03" y0="138.63" x1="179.78">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 179.78; x1: 182.43; y0: 138.63; y1: 148.13; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="179.78" y0="138.63" x1="304.72">). Nature provides a&#160;broad array of goods and services that are critical to good quality of life and human well-being.

However, Reyers and Selig (2020) note that the assessment by (IPBES 2019a) could only assess the consequences of trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services for 35 out of the 169 SDG targets due to data and knowledge gaps, and lack of clarity about the relationship between biodiversity, ecosystem services and SDGs.</span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.28" top="246.65"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.79; y0: 246.65; y1: 256.15; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="246.65" x1="563.28">Progress in achieving the 20 Aichi Biodiversity targets which are critical for realising the SDGs has been poor with most of the targets not being achieved or only partially realised (SCBD 2020). There could be synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services and human well-being. For instance, a&#160;study notes that although policy interventions and incentives to enhance supply of provisioning services (e.g.,&#160;agricultural production) have led to higher GDP, it may have an adverse effect on the regulatory services of ecosystems (Kirchner et al. 2015). However, we are aware of the inadequacies of traditional GDP as an indicator of well-being. In this context the Dasgupta Biodiversity Review argues for using the inclusive wealth approach to accurately measure social well-being by tracking the changes in produced, human and natural capital (Dasgupta 2021). Targets for nature (biodiversity and ecosystem services) should be refined so as to fit in with the metrics tracked by the SDGs (IPBES 2016; Rosa et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="138.04" top="714.85"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.28; y0: 714.85; y1: 723.35; width: 4.41; font-size: 8.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="70.87" y0="714.85" x1="138.04">Box&#160;7.13 (continued)</span></div><div left="70.87" right="154.78" top="690.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 77.35; y0: 690.48; y1: 700.48; width: 6.48; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="690.48" x1="154.78">Governance context</span></div><div left="70.87" right="128.71" top="666.6"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.97; y0: 666.6; y1: 676.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="70.87" y0="666.6" x1="128.71">Critical enablers</span><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 654.6; y1: 664.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="654.6" x1="549.07">The role assigned to local government mechanisms such as Ghana&#8217;s Community Resource Management Area Mechanisms (CREMAs) was expected to give a&#160;voice to smallholders who are an important stakeholder in Ghana&#8217;s cocoa sector. CREMAs are inclusive because authority and ownership of natural resources are devolved to local communities who can thus have a&#160;voice in influencing CSC policy thereby ensuring equity and adapting CSC to local contexts. However, ensuring the long-term sustainability of CREMAs will help to make them a&#160;reliable mechanism for farmers to voice their concerns and aspirations, and ensure their independence as a&#160;legitimate governance structure in the long run. The private sector was assigned an important role to popularise climate-smart cocoa production in Ghana. However, whether this will work to the advantage of smallholder cocoa producers needs to be seen.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="125.54" top="558.62"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.97; y0: 558.62; y1: 568.12; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="70.87" y0="558.62" x1="125.54">Critical barriers</span><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 546.62; y1: 556.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="546.62" x1="549.05">The policy intervention overlooks the institutional constraints characteristic of the cocoa sector in Ghana where small farmers are dominant and have skewed access to resources and markets. Lack of secure tenure (tree rights) where the ownership of shade trees and timber vests with the state, bureaucratic and legal hurdles to register trees in their cocoa farms are major constraints that impede realisation of the expected benefits of the CSC programme. This is a&#160;great disincentive for small cocoa producers to implement CSC initiatives and nurture the shade tree seedlings and undertake land improvement measures. The state marketing board has the monopoly in buying and marketing of cocoa beans including exports which impeded CREMAs or farming communities from directly selling their produce to MNCs and traders. However, many MNCs have been involved in setting up of CREMA or similar structures, extending premium prices and non-monetary benefits (access to credit, shade tree seedlings, agrochemicals) thus indirectly securing their cocoa supply chains. A&#160;biased ecological discourse about the benefits of climate-smart agriculture and sustainable intensive narrative, complexities regarding the optimal shade levels for growing cocoa, and dependence on agrochemicals are issues that affect the success and sustainability of the project intervention. Dominance of private sector players especially MNCs in the sector may be detrimental to the interests of smallholder cocoa producers (Nasser et al. 2020).</span></div></body></html>
