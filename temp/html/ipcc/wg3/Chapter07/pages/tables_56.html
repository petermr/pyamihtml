      <td>One curve (EMF-33) is determined from stylised scenarios using IAMs (Rose et al. 2020). One of the two curves determined from\nsectoral models, Constant Land Cover, reflects supply chain emissions and changes in land carbon storage caused by the biomass\nsupply system itself. These two curves are obtained with modelling approaches compatible with the modelling protocol used for the\nscenarios in the AR6 database, which accounts for the land-use change and all other GHG emissions along a given transformation\ntrajectory, enabling assessments of the warming level incurred.</td>

      <td>The Natural Regrowth curve attribute additional &#8216;counterfactual emissions&#8217; to the bioenergy system, corresponding to estimated\nuptake of CO in a counterfactual scenario where land is not used for bioenergy but instead subject to natural vegetation regrowth.\n2\nThis curve does not show actual emissions from the bioenergy system, but it provides insights in the mitigation value of the bioenergy\noption compared to alternative land-use strategies. To illustrate, if biomass is used instead of a primary energy source with emission\nfactor 75 kgCO GJ&#8211;1, and the median values in the Natural Regrowth curve are adopted, then the curve indicates that up to about\n2\n150 EJ of biomass can be produced and used for energy while achieving higher net GHG savings than the alternative to set aside the\nsame land for natural vegetation regrowth (assuming same conversion factor).</td>

      <td>The large ranges in the bars signify the importance of uncertainties and how the biomass is deployed. Variation in energy conversion\nefficiencies and uncertainty about magnitude, timing, and permanence of land carbon storage further complicate the comparison.\nFinally, not shown in Box 7.7, Figure 1, the emission-supply curves would be adjusted downwards if displacement of emission intensive\nenergy was included or if the bioenergy is combined with CCS to provide CDR.</td>
