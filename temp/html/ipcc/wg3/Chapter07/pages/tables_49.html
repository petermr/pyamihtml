It was also shown that, in all regions, there is considerable yield advantage when\na portfolio of technologies is used, rather than the isolated use of technologies (Govaerts et al. 2005; Zougmor&#233; et al. 2014). Moreover,\nfarmers are using research results to promote their products as climate-smart leading to increases in their income (Acosta-Alba\net al. 2019). However, climatic risk sites and socio-economic conditions together with a lack of resource availability are key issues\nconstraining agriculture across all five regions.</td>
