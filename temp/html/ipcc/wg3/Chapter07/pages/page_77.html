The benefits of various natural climate solutions depend on a&#160;variety of spatially dependent issues as well as institutional factors, including their management status (managed or unmanaged systems), their productivity, opportunity costs, technical difficulty of implementation, local willingness to consider, property rights and institutions, among other factors. Biomass energy, as described elsewhere in this chapter and in (Cross-Working Group Box&#160;3 in Chapter&#160;12), is a&#160;potential example of an option with trade-offs that emerge when policies favour one type of mitigation strategy over another. Bioenergy production needs safeguards to limit negative impacts on carbon stocks on the land base as is already in place in the EU Renewable Energy Directive and several national schemes in Netherlands, UK and Denmark (Buchholz et al. 2016; Khanna et al. 2017; DeCicco and Schlesinger 2018; Favero et al. 2020). It is argued that a&#160;carbon tax on only fossil fuel derived emissions, may lead to massive deployment of bioenergy, although the effects of such a&#160;policy can be mitigated when combined with policies that encourage sustainable forest management and protection of forest carbon stocks as well as forest management certification (</span><span style="x0: 104.08; x1: 108.66; y0: 174.63; y1: 184.13; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="104.08" y0="174.63" x1="160.97">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 160.97; x1: 163.62; y0: 174.63; y1: 184.13; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="160.97" y0="174.63" x1="304.73">) (Nabuurs et al. 2017, Baker et al. 2019 and Favero et al.&#160;2020).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="138.64"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 58.99; y0: 138.64; y1: 148.14; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="138.64" x1="304.75">If biomass energy production expands and shifts to carbon capture and storage (e.g.,&#160;BECCS) during the century, there could be a&#160;significant increase in the area of crop and forestland used for biomass energy production (Sections&#160;7.4 and 7.5). BECCS is not projected to be widely implemented for several decades, but in the meantime, policy efforts to advance land-based measures including reforestation and restoration activities (Strassburg et al. </span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.24" top="438.65"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.78; y0: 438.65; y1: 448.15; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="438.65" x1="563.24">2020) combined with sustainable management and provision of agricultural and wood products are widely expected to increase the terrestrial pool of carbon (Cross-Working Group Box&#160;3 in Chapter&#160;12). Carbon sequestration policies, sustainable land management (forest and agriculture), and biomass energy policies can be complementary (Favero et al. 2017; Baker et al. 2019). However, if private markets emerge for biomass and BECCS on the scale suggested in the SR1.5, policy efforts must ramp up to substantially value, encourage, and protect terrestrial carbon stocks and ecosystems to avoid outcomes inconsistent with many SDGs (</span><span style="x0: 424.79; x1: 429.37; y0: 330.66; y1: 340.16; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="424.79" y0="330.66" x1="481.79">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 481.79; x1: 484.43; y0: 330.66; y1: 340.16; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="481.79" y0="330.66" x1="486.71">).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="557.31" top="294.48"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.41; y0: 294.48; y1: 304.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="315.21" y0="294.48" x1="557.31">7.6.4 Barriers and Opportunities for AFOLU Mitigation</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="270.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 270.6; y1: 280.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="270.6" x1="563.28">The AR5 and other assessments have acknowledged many barriers and opportunities to effective implementation of AFOLU measures. Many of these barriers and opportunities focus on the context in developing countries, where a&#160;significant portion of the world&#8217;s cost-effective mitigation exists, but where domestic financing for implementation is likely to be limited. The SSPs capture some of this context, and as a&#160;result, IAMs (Section&#160;7.5) exhibit a&#160;wide range of land-use outcomes, as well as mitigation potential. Potential mitigation, however, will be influenced by barriers and opportunities that are not considered by IAMs or by bottom-up studies reviewed here. For example, more efficient food production systems, or sustainable intensification within agriculture, and globalised trade could enhance the extent of natural ecosystems leading to lower GHG emissions from the land system and lower food prices (Popp et al. 2017), but this (or any) pathway will create new barriers to implementation and encourage new opportunities, negating potential benefits (Box&#160;7.11). It is critically important to consider the current context in any country.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="141.34" top="714.85"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.28; y0: 714.85; y1: 723.35; width: 4.41; font-size: 8.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="70.87" y0="714.85" x1="141.34">Box 7.11 (Continued) </span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.15" top="690.6"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.26; y0: 690.6; y1: 700.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="690.6" x1="549.15">at wider spatial scales, such as catchments or regions (Weltin et al. 2018; Bengochea Paz et al. 2020; Cassman and Grassini 2020). Impacts may be considered in relative terms (per area or product unit), with relationships potentially antagonistic. Both area- and product unit-based metrics are valid, relevant under different contexts and useful in approaching SI, but do not capture overall impacts and trade-offs (Garnett 2014). To reduce the risk of unsustainable intensification, quantitative data and selection of appropriate metrics to identify and guide strategies are paramount (Garnett et al. 2013; Gunton et al. 2016; Cassman and Grassini 2020).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="230.98" top="618.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 76.98; y0: 618.48; y1: 628.48; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="618.48" x1="230.98">Avoiding unsustainable intensification</span><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 73.17; y0: 606.6; y1: 616.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="606.6" x1="549.09">It is critical that intensification does not drive expansion of unsustainable practices. Increased productivity with associated economic reward could incentivise and reward agricultural land expansion, or environmentally and socially damaging practices on existing and former agricultural land (Ceddia et al. 2013; Phalan 2018). Accordingly, coordinated policies are crucial to ensuring desired outcomes (Godfray and Garnett 2014; Reddy et al. 2020; Kassam and Kassam 2020). Barretto et al. (2013) found that in agriculturally consolidated areas, land-use intensification coincided with either a&#160;contraction of both cropland and pasture areas, or cropland expansion at the expense of pastures, both resulting in a&#160;stable farmed area. In contrast, in agricultural frontier areas, land-use intensification coincided with expansion of agricultural lands.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.05" top="510.61"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 73.17; y0: 510.61; y1: 520.11; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="510.61" x1="549.05">In conclusion, SI within agriculture is needed given the rising global population and the need to address multiple environmental and social externalities associated with agricultural activities. However, implementation requires strong stakeholder engagement, appropriate regulations, rigorous monitoring and verification and comprehensive outreach and knowledge exchange programmes.</span></div></body></html>
