This broader inclusion resulted from a&#160;long process of insertion and articulation in the government dating back to 2003 while elaborating on the Sustainable Amazon Plan. In May 2003, a&#160;historic meeting took place in an Amazonian city, with the president of the Republic, state governors, ministers, and various business leaders, civil institutions, and social movements. It was presented and approved the document entitled &#8216;Sustainable Amazonia&#160;&#8211; Guidelines and Priorities of the Ministry of Environment for the Sustainable Development of the Amazon Brazilian&#8217;, containing several guidelines for conservation and sustainable use in the region. At the meeting, the Union and some states signed a&#160;Cooperation Agreement aiming to elaborate a&#160;plan for the Amazon, to be widely discussed with the various sectors of the regional and national society (Ministerio do Meio Ambiente, MMA, 2013).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="186.4" top="474.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 73.65; y0: 474.48; y1: 484.48; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="474.48" x1="186.4">Interactions and limitations</span><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 462.6; y1: 472.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="462.6" x1="549.05">The PPCDAm had three main lines of action: (i) territorial management and land use; (ii) command and control; and (iii) promotion of sustainable practices. During the execution of the 1st and 2nd phases of the PPCDAm (2004&#8211;2011), important results in the territorial management and land-use component included, for example, the creation of 25 Mha of federal Protected Areas (PAs) located mainly in front of the expansion of deforestation, as well as the homologation of 10 Mha of Indigenous Lands. Also, states and municipalities created approximately 25 Mha, so that all spheres of government contributed to the expansion of PAs in the Brazilian Amazon. In the &#8216;command and control&#8217; component, agencies performed hundreds of inspection operations against illegal activities (e.g.,&#160;illegal logging) under strategic planning based on technical and territorial priorities. Besides, there was a&#160;significant improvement of the&#160;environmental monitoring systems, involving the analysis of satellite images to guide actions on the ground. Another policy was the restriction of public credit to enterprises linked to illegal deforestation following a&#160;resolution of the Brazilian Central Bank (2008) (Ministerio do Meio Ambiente, MMA, 2013). Also, in 2008, Brazil created the Amazon Fund, a&#160;REDD+ mechanism (Government of Brazil, n.d.).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.08" top="318.62"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 76.32; y0: 318.62; y1: 328.12; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="318.62" x1="549.08">However, the country&#8217;s political polarisation has gradually eroded environmental governance, especially after the Brazilian Forest Code changes in 2012 (major environmental law in Brazil), the presidential impeachment in 2016, presidential elections in 2018, and the start of the new federal administration in 2019. Successful deforestation control policies are being negatively affected by critical changes in the political context, and weakening the environmental rule of law, forest conservation, and sustainable development programmes (for example, changes in the Amazon Fund governance in disagreement with the main donors).
