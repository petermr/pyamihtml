      <td>Summary of the case.Indigenous peoples include more than 5000 different peoples, with over 370 million people, in 70 countries\non five continents (UNIPP 2012). For example, in Latin America and Caribbean, forests cover more than 80% of the area occupied by\nindigenous peoples (330 million hectares) (FAO and FILAC, 2021) which points to their critical role for forest governance (Garnett et al.\n2018; Fa et al. 2020). The Menominee people (Wisconsin, USA) practice sustainable forestry on their reservation according to a land\nethic integral to the tribal identity. The Tribe calls themselves &#8216;The Forest Keepers&#8217;, recognising that the connection of their future to\nthe sustainable management of the forest that allowed the forest volume standing today to be higher than when timber harvesting\nbegan more than 160 years ago. Management practices are based on continuous forest inventories (Mausel et al. 2017).</td>

      <td>Introduction to the case. Forest management and timber harvesting operations began shortly after the Menominee Indian Reservation\nwas created by treaty in 1854. The Menominee reservation sits on about 95,000 ha of land in Wisconsin that spans multiple forest types\nand is more diverse than adjacent forests. The collectively maintained reservation has 87% of its land under sustained yield forestry.</td>

      <td>Case description. The Tribe, in the 19th century, had already mastered vegetation manipulation with fire, sustainable forestry,\nmultiple-use, ecosystem, and adaptive management. The centrepiece of the Tribe&#8217;s economy has been its forest product industry,\nMenominee Tribal Enterprises (MTE) (Pecore 1992). A balance between growth and removals and continuous forest inventories (CFI)\nare central for forest management for the past 160 years, aiming not at very large volumes, but at very high-quality trees. During this\nsame period, more than 2.3 billion board feet have been harvested from the same area, equivalent to 0.3 m3 ha&#8211;1 yr&#8211;1.</td>

      <td>Interactions and limitations. In 2013, the Menominee Tribe started a collaboration with the US Forest Service to implement climate\nadaptation measures. The Tribe actively works to reduce the risk of forest damage and decided to further promote diversity by\nplanting tree seedlings adapted to a warming climate (https://toolkit.climate.gov/case-studies/and-trees-will-last-forever). However,\nnew challenges are related to increasing pressures on forest ecosystems such as non-native insects, pathogens, weed invasions, and\nthe costs for continuous forest inventories to support long-term forest management.</td>

      <td>Identified lessons. The elements of sustainability are intertwined with Menominee history, culture, spirituality, and ethics. The\nbalance between the environment, community, and economy for the short term as well as future generations is an example of\nprotecting the entire environment as the Menominee land is a non-fragmented remnant of the prehistoric Lake States forest which\nhas been dramatically reduced all around the reserve (Schabel and Pecore 1997). These and other types of community forest owner\nassociations exist all over the world. Examples are S&#246;dra in Sweden (with 52,000 forest owners) (S&#246;dra, 2021) or Waldbauernverband\nin North-Rhine Westphalia (with 150,000 forest owners and covering 585,000 ha) (AGDW-The Forest Owners, 2021). These are ways\nfor small forest owners to educate, jointly put wood on the market, employ better forest management, use machinery together, and\napply certification jointly. In this manner and with all their diversity of goals, they manage to maintain carbon sinks and stocks, while\npreserving biodiversity and producing wood.</td>
