      <td>AE can improve system resilience and bring multiple co-benefits (Altieri et al. 2015; Mbow et al. 2019; Aguilera et al. 2020; Tittonell\n2020; Wanger et al. 2020) (AR6 WGII Box 5.10). Limited evidence concerning the mitigation capacity of AE at a system level (Saj\net al. 2017; Snapp et al. 2021) makes conclusions difficult, yet studies into specific practices that may be incorporated, suggest AE\nmay have mitigation potential (medium confidence) (Section 7.4.3). However, AE, that incorporates management practices used in\norganic farming (see below), may result in reduced yields, driving compensatory agricultural production elsewhere. Research into\nGHG mitigation by AE as a system and impacts of wide-scale implementation is required. Despite absence of a universally accepted\ndefinition (see Annex I), RA is gaining increasing attention and shares principles of AE. Some descriptions include carbon sequestration\nas a specific aim (Elevitch et al. 2018). Few studies have assessed mitigation potential of RA at a system level (e.g., Colley et al. 2020).\nLike AE, it is likely that RA can contribute to mitigation, the extent to which is currently unclear and by its case-specific design, will\nvary (medium confidence).</td>

Theoretically, CA may facilitate improved nitrogen use efficiency (limited evidence) (Lal\n2015; Powlson et al. 2016), though CA appears to have mixed effects on soil N O emission (Six et al. 2004; Mei et al. 2018). CA is\n2\nnoted for its adaptation benefits, with wide agreement that CA can enhance system resilience to climate related stress, notably in dry\nregions. There is evidence that CA can contribute to mitigation, but its contribution is depended on multiple factors including climate\nand residue returns (high confidence).</td>

Research indicates some mitigation potential, including by facilitating\nsustainable intensification (Box 7.11), though benefits are likely to be highly context specific (Herrero et al. 2013; Carvalho et al. 2014;\nPiva et al. 2014; de Figueiredo et al. 2017; Rosenstock et al. 2014; Weindl et al. 2015; Thornton and Herrero 2015; Descheemaeker et al.\n2016; Lal 2020; Guenet et al. 2021).

Several studies have reviewed the emissions footprint of organic compared to conventional\nsystems (Mondelaers et al. 2009; Tuomisto et al. 2012; Skinner et al. 2014; Meier et al. 2015; Seufert and Ramankutty 2017; Clark and\nTilman 2017; Meemken and Qaim 2018; Bellassen et al. 2021). Acknowledging potential assessment limitations (Meier et al. 2015;\nvan der Werf et al. 2020), evidence suggests organic production to typically generate lower emissions per unit of area, while emissions\nper unit of product vary and depend on the product (high agreement, medium evidence). OF has been suggested to increase soil\ncarbon sequestration (Gattinger et al. 2012), though definitive conclusions are challenging (Leifeld et al. 2013). Fewer studies consider\nimpacts of large-scale conversion from conventional to organic production globally. Though context specific (Seufert and Ramankutty\n2017), OF is reported to typically generate lower yields (Seufert et al. 2012; De Ponti et al. 2012; Kirchmann 2019; Biernat et al. 2020).\nLarge-scale conversion, without fundamental changes in food systems and diets (Muller et al. 2017; Theurl et al. 2020), may lead to\nincreases in absolute emissions from land-use change, driven by greater land requirements to maintain production (L.G. Smith et al.\n2019; Leifeld 2016; Meemken and Qaim 2018).</td>
