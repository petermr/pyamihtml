      <td>at wider spatial scales, such as catchments or regions (Weltin et al. 2018; Bengochea Paz et al. 2020; Cassman and Grassini 2020).\nImpacts may be considered in relative terms (per area or product unit), with relationships potentially antagonistic. Both area- and\nproduct unit-based metrics are valid, relevant under different contexts and useful in approaching SI, but do not capture overall impacts\nand trade-offs (Garnett 2014). To reduce the risk of unsustainable intensification, quantitative data and selection of appropriate\nmetrics to identify and guide strategies are paramount (Garnett et al. 2013; Gunton et al. 2016; Cassman and Grassini 2020).</td>

Accordingly, coordinated policies are crucial to ensuring desired\noutcomes (Godfray and Garnett 2014; Reddy et al. 2020; Kassam and Kassam 2020). Barretto et al. (2013) found that in agriculturally\nconsolidated areas, land-use intensification coincided with either a contraction of both cropland and pasture areas, or cropland\nexpansion at the expense of pastures, both resulting in a stable farmed area. In contrast, in agricultural frontier areas, land-use\nintensification coincided with expansion of agricultural lands.</td>
