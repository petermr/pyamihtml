In the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the second-largest area of tropical forest in the world occurs, mining-related deforestation exacerbated by violent conflict (Butsic et al. 2015). In India, mining has contributed to deforestation at a&#160;district level, with coal, iron and limestone having had the most adverse impact on forest area loss (Ranjan 2019). Gold mining is also identified as a&#160;driver of deforestation in Myanmar (Papworth et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="169.93" top="618.48"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.82; y0: 618.48; y1: 628.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="618.48" x1="169.93">7.3.1.4 Fire Regime Changes</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.09" top="594.6"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 58.59; y0: 594.6; y1: 604.1; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="594.6" x1="299.09">Wildland fires account for approximately 70% of the global biomass burned annually (van der Werf et al. 2017) and constitute a&#160;large global source of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols (Gunsch et al. 2018) (IPCC WGI AR6). Although fires are part of the natural system, the frequency of fires has increased in many areas, exacerbated by decreases in precipitation, including in many regions with humid and temperate forests that rarely experience large-scale fires naturally. Natural and human-ignited fires affect all major biomes, from peatlands through shrublands to tropical and boreal forests, altering ecosystem structure and functioning (Arga&#241;araz et al. 2015; Nunes et al. 2016; Remy et al. 2017; Mancini et al. 2018; Arag&#227;o et al. 2018; Engel et al. 2019; Rodr&#237;guez V&#225;squez et al. 2021). However, the degree of incidence and regional trends are quite different and a&#160;study over 14 years indicated, on average, the largest fires in Australia, boreal North America and Northern Hemisphere Africa (Andela et al. 2019). More than half of the terrestrial surface of the Earth has fire&#160;regimes outside the range of natural variability, with changes in fire frequency and intensity posing major challenges for land restoration and recovery (Barger et al. 2018). In some ecosystems, fire prevention might lead to accumulation of large fuel loads that enable wildfires (Moreira et al. 2020a).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.09" top="330.63"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.48; y0: 330.63; y1: 340.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="330.63" x1="299.09">About 98 Mha of forest and savannahs are estimated to have been affected by fire in 2015 (FAO and UNEP 2020). Fire is a&#160;prevalent forest disturbance in the tropics where about 4% of the total forest and savannah area in that year was burned and more than two-thirds of the total area affected was in Africa and South America; mostly open savanna types (FAO and UNEP 2020). Fires have many different causes, with land clearing for agriculture the primary driver in tropical regions, for example, clearance for industrial oil-palm and paper-pulp plantations in Indonesia (Chisholm et al. 2016), or for pastures in the Amazon (Barlow et al. 2020). Other socio-economic factors are also associated with wildfire regimes such as land-use conflict and socio-demographic aspects (Nunes et al. 2016; Mancini et al. 2018). Wildfire regimes are also changing by the influence of climate change, with wildfire seasons becoming longer, wildfire average size increases in many areas and wildfires occurring in areas where they did not occur before (Jolly et al. 2015; Art&#233;s et al. 2019). Human influence has likely increased fire weather in some regions of all inhabited continents (IPCC AR6 WGI Technical Summary) and, in  the last years, fire seasons of unprecedented magnitude occurred in&#160;diverse regions as California (Goss et al. 2020), the Mediterranean basin (Ruffault et al. 2020), Canada (Kirchmeier-Young et al. 2019) with unprecedented fires in British Columbia in 2021, the Arctic and Siberia (McCarty et al. 2020), Brazilian Amazon (Silva et al. 2021) and Pantanal (Leal Filho et al. 2021), Chile (Bowman et al. 2019) and </span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.57" top="726.67"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 315.0; y0: 726.67; y1: 736.17; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="726.67" x1="557.57">Australia (Ward et al. 2020; Gallagher et al. 2021).

Considering forest uses, about 30% (1.2 billion ha) of all forests is used primarily for production (wood and non-wood forest products), about 10% (424 Mha) is designated for biodiversity conservation, 398 Mha for the protection of soil and water, and 186 Mha is allocated for social services (recreation, tourism, education research and the conservation of cultural and spiritual sites) (FAO and UNEP 2020). While the rate of increase in the area of forest allocated primarily for biodiversity conservation has slowed in the last ten&#160;years, the rate of increase in the area of forest allocated for soil and water protection has grown since 1990, and notably in the last ten years.

Overall, wood removals are increasing globally as demand for, and the consumption of wood products grows annually by 1% in line with growing populations and incomes with this trend expected to continue in coming decades. When done in a&#160;sustainable way, more regrowth will occur and is stimulated by management, resulting in a&#160;net sink. However illegal and unsustainable logging (i.e., harvesting of timber in contravention of the laws and regulations of the country of harvest) is a&#160;global problem with significant negative economic (e.g.,&#160;lost revenue), environmental (e.g.,&#160;deforestation, forest degradation, GHG emissions and biodiversity losses) and social impact (e.g.,&#160;conflicts over land and resources, disempowerment of local and indigenous communities) (World Bank 2019). Many countries around the world have introduced regulations for the international trade of forest products to reduce illegal logging, with significant and positive impacts (Guan et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.61" top="282.63"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 315.36; y0: 282.63; y1: 292.13; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="282.63" x1="557.61">Over-extraction of wood for timber and fuelwood is identified as an important driver of mangrove deforestation and degradation (Bhattarai 2011; Ajonina et al. 2014; Webb et al. 2014; Giri et al. 2015; Thomas et al. 2017; Fauzi et al. 2019). Unsustainable selective logging and over-extraction of wood is a&#160;substantial form of forest and mangrove degradation in many tropical and developing countries, with emissions associated with the extracted wood, incidental damage to the surrounding forest and from logging infrastructure (Bhattarai 2011; Ajonina et al. 2014; Webb et al. 2014; Pearson et al. 2014, Giri et al. 2015; Thomas et al. 2017; Fauzi et al. 2019). Traditional fuelwood and charcoal continue to represent a&#160;dominant share of total wood consumption in low-income countries (Barger et al. 2018). Regionally, the percentage of total wood harvested used as fuelwood varies from 90% in Africa, 62% in Asia, 50% in South America to less than 20% in Europe, North America and Oceania. Under current projections, efforts to intensify wood production in plantation forests, together with increases in fuel-use efficiency and electrification, are suggested to only partly alleviate the pressure on native forests (Barger et al. 2018). Nevertheless, the area of forest under management plans has increased in all regions since 2000 </span></div></body></html>
