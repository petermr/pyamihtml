Increase of land values of areas adjacent to roads also drives speculation and deforestation related to land tenure (Fearnside 2015). If poorly planned, infrastructure can facilitate fires, illegal mining, and wildlife poaching with consequences for GHG emissions and biodiversity conservation.

For example, the total area of intact wilderness is declining rapidly worldwide (Watson et al. 2016), 70% of the world&#8217;s forests are now less than 1 km from a&#160;forest edge (Haddad et al. 2015), the extent of tropical forest fragmentation is accelerating exponentially (Taubert et al. 2018). One of the most direct and immediate driver of deforestation and biodiversity decline is the dramatic expansion of roads and other transportation infrastructure (Laurance et al. 2014a; Laurance and&#160;Arrea 2017; Alamgir et al. 2017).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="139.97" top="510.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 76.43; y0: 510.48; y1: 520.48; width: 5.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="510.48" x1="139.97">Case description</span><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 74.91; y0: 498.6; y1: 508.1; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="498.6" x1="546.79">From 2010 to 2050, the total length of paved roads is projected to increase by 25 million km (Dulac 2013) including large infrastructure-expansion schemes in Asia (Laurance and Arrea 2017; Lechner et al. 2018) and in South America (Laurance et al. 2001; Killeen 2007), as well as widespread illegal or unplanned road building (Laurance et al. 2009; Barber et al. 2014). For example, in the Amazon, 95% of all deforestation occurs within 5.5 km of a&#160;road, and for every km of legal road there are nearly three km of illegal roads (Barber et al. 2014).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="186.4" top="426.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 73.65; y0: 426.48; y1: 436.48; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="426.48" x1="186.4">Interactions and limitations</span><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 78.26; y0: 414.6; y1: 424.1; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="414.6" x1="549.11">More than any other proximate factor, the dramatic expansion of roads is determining the pace and patterns of habitat disruption and its impacts on biodiversity (Laurance et al. 2009; Laurance and Arrea 2017). Much road expansion is poorly planned. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for roads and other infrastructure are typically too short term and superficial to detect rare species or assess long-term or indirect impacts of projects (Flyvbjerg 2009; Laurance and Arrea 2017). Another limitation is the consideration of each project in isolation from other existing or planned developments (Laurance et al. 2014b). Hence, EIAs alone are inadequate for planning infrastructure projects and assessing their broader environmental, social, and financial impacts and risks (Laurance et al. 2015a; Alamgir et al. 2017, 2018).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="103.08" top="318.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.31; y0: 318.48; y1: 328.48; width: 4.44; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="318.48" x1="103.08">Lessons</span><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 306.6; y1: 316.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="306.6" x1="549.04">The large-scale, proactive land-use planning is an option for managing the development of modern infrastructure. Approaches such as the &#8216;Global Roadmap&#8217; scheme (Laurance and Balmford 2013; Laurance et al. 2014a) Strategic Environmental Assessments (Fischer 2007) can be used to evaluate the relative costs and benefits of infrastructure projects, and to spatially prioritise land uses to optimise human benefits while limited new infrastructure in areas of intact or critical habitats. For example, the Global Roadmap strategy has been used in parts of South-East Asia (Sloan et al. 2018), Indochina (Balmford et al. 2016), and sub-Saharan Africa (Laurance et al. 2015b) to devise land-use zoning that can help optimise the many risks and rewards of planned infrastructure projects.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="219.12" top="198.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 198.48; y1: 208.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="198.48" x1="219.12">7.3.1.3 Extractive Industry Development</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.77" top="174.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 174.6; y1: 184.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="174.6" x1="304.77">The extent and scale of mining is growing due to increased global demand (UNEP 2019). Due to declining ore grades, more ore needs to be processed to meet demand, with extensive use of open cast mining. A&#160;low-carbon future may be more mineral intensive with, for example, clean energy technologies requiring greater inputs in comparison to fossil-fuel-based technologies (Hund et al. 2020). Mining presents cumulative environmental impacts, especially in intensively mined regions (UNEP 2019). The impact of mining on deforestation varies considerably across minerals and countries.

The total estimated area of gold mining throughout the region increased by about 40% between 2012 and 2016 (Asner and Tupayachi 2017).
