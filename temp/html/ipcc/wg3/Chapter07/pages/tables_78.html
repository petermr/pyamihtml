      <td>Achieving the large contribution to mitigation that the AFOLU sector can make requires public and private investment. Austin et al.\n(2020) estimate that in forestry, USD178 billion yr&#8211;1 is needed over the next decade to achieve 5 GtCO yr&#8211;1, and investments need\n2\nto ramp up to USD400 billion yr&#8211;1 by 2050 to expand effort to 6 GtCO yr&#8211;1. Other land-based options, such as mangrove protection,\n2\npeatland restoration, and agricultural options would increase this total cost estimate, but have smaller to negligible opportunity costs.</td>

      <td>Financing needs in AFOLU, and in particular in forestry, include both the direct effects of any changes in activities &#8211; costs of planting\nor managing trees, net revenues from harvesting, costs of thinning, costs of fire management, and so on &#8211; as well as the opportunity\ncosts associated with land-use change. Opportunity costs are a critical component of AFOLU finance, and must be included in any\nestimate of the funds necessary to carry out projects. They are largest, as share of total costs, in forestry because they play a prominent\nrole in achieving high levels of afforestation, avoided deforestation, and improved forest management. In case of increasing soil\ncarbon in croplands through reduced tillage, there are often cost savings associated with increased residues because there is less effort\ntilling, but the carbon effects per hectare are also modest. There could, however, be small opportunity costs in cases where residues\nmay otherwise be marketed to a biorefinery. The effect of reduced tillage on yields varies considerably across sites and crop types, but\ntends to enhance yields modestly in the longer-run.</td>

      <td>Opportunity costs are a direct financing costs for activities that require land uses to change. For instance a government can encourage\nplanting forests on agricultural land by (a) requiring it, (b) setting up a market or market-based incentives, or (c) buying the land and\ndoing it themselves. In each case, the required investment is the same &#8211; the planting cost plus the net foregone returns of agricultural\nrents &#8211; even though a different entity pays the cost. Private entities that pay for carbon credits will also bear the direct costs of\nplanting plus the opportunity costs. In the case of avoided deforestation, opportunity costs similarly must be paid to individual actors\nto avoid the deforestation.</td>
