Such losses will not only affect current economic growth but also impede the capacity for future economic growth.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.73" top="594.61"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.26; y0: 594.61; y1: 604.11; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="594.61" x1="304.73">Population growth, economic development, urbanisation, technology, climate change, global trade and consumption, policy and governance are key drivers of global environmental change over recent decades (Kram et al. 2014; UNEP 2019; WWF 2020). Changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services are mainly driven by habitat loss, climate change, invasive species, over-exploitation of natural resources, and pollution (Millenium Ecosystem Assesment 2005). The relative importance of these drivers varies across biomes, regions, and countries. Climate change is expected to be a&#160;major driver of biodiversity loss in the coming decades, followed by commercial forestry and bioenergy production (OECD 2012; UNEP 2019). Population growth along with rising incomes and changes in consumption and dietary patterns, will exert immense pressure on land and other natural resources (IPCC 2019). Current estimates suggest that 75% of the land surface has been significantly anthropogenically altered, with 66% of the ocean area experiencing increasing cumulative impacts and over 85% of wetland area lost (IPBES 2019a). As discussed, in Section&#160;7.3, land-use change is driven amongst others by agriculture, forestry (logging and fuelwood harvesting), infrastructural development and urbanisation, all of which may also generate localised air, water, and soil pollution (IPBES 2019a). Over a&#160;third of the world&#8217;s land surface and nearly three-quarters of available freshwater resources are devoted to crop or livestock production (IPBES 2019a). Despite a&#160;slight reduction in global agricultural area since 2000, regional agricultural area expansion has occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East (FAO 2019c; OECD and FAO 2019). The degradation of tropical forests and biodiversity hotspots, endangers habitat for many threatened and endemic species, and reduces valuable ecosystem services. However, trends vary considerably by region. As noted in Section&#160;7.3, global forest area declined by roughly 178 Mha between 1990 and 2020 (FAO 2020a), though the rate of net forest loss has decreased over the period, due to reduced deforestation in some countries and forest gains in others. Between 1990 to 2015, forest cover fell by almost 13% in South-East Asia, largely due to an increase in timber extraction, large-scale biofuel plantations and expansion of intensive agriculture and shrimp farms, whereas in North-East Asia and South Asia it increased by 23% and 6% respectively, through policy instruments such as joint forest management, payment for ecosystem services, and restoration of degraded forests (IPBES 2018b). It is lamenting that the area under natural forests which are rich in biodiversity and provide diverse ecosystem services decreased by 301 Mha between 1990 and 2020, decreasing in most regions except Europe and Oceania with largest losses reported in sub-Saharan Africa (FAO 2020a).

The value of global agricultural output (over USD3.54 trillion in 2018) had increased approximately threefold since 1970, and roundwood production (industrial roundwood and fuelwood) by 27%, between 1980 to 2018, reaching some 4 billion m</span><span style="x0: 379.41; x1: 382.6; y0: 526.64; y1: 533.29; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="379.41" y0="526.64" x1="382.6">3</span><span style="x0: 386.42; x1: 388.53; y0: 522.6; y1: 532.1; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="386.42" y0="522.6" x1="563.28">in 2018. However, the positive trends in these four ecosystem services does not indicate long-term sustainability. If increases in agricultural production are realised through forest clearance or through increasing energy-intensive inputs, gains are likely to be unsustainable in the long run. Similarly, an increase in fish production may involve overfishing, leading to local species declines which also impacts fish prices, fishing revenues, and the well-being of coastal and fishing communities (Sumaila and Lam 2020). Climate change and other drivers are likely to affect future fish catch potential, although impacts will differ across regions (Sumaila et al. 2017; Domke et al. 2019).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="378.62"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 378.62; y1: 388.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="378.62" x1="563.26">The increasing trend in aquaculture production especially in South and South-East Asia through intensive methods affects existing food production and ecosystems by diverting rice fields or mangroves (Bhattacharya and Ninan 2011). Although extensive traditional fish farming of carp in central Europe can contribute to landscape management, enhance biodiversity and provide ecosystem services, there are several barriers to scale up production due to strict EU environmental regulations, vulnerability to extreme weather events, and to avian predators that are protected by EU laws, and disadvantages faced by small-scale enterprises that dominate the sector (European-Commission 2021). Bioenergy production may have high opportunity costs in land-scarce areas and compete with land used for food production which threatens food security and affects the poor and vulnerable. But these impacts will differ across scale, contexts and other factors.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.23" top="186.64"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.31; y0: 186.64; y1: 196.14; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="186.64" x1="563.23">Currently, land degradation is estimated to have reduced productivity in 23% of the global terrestrial area, and between USD235 billion and USD577 billion in annual global crop output is at risk because of pollinator loss (IPBES 2019a). The global trends reviewed above are based on data from 2000 studies. It is not clear whether the assessment included a&#160;quality control check of the studies evaluated and suffer from aggregation bias. For instance, a&#160;recent meta-analysis of global forest valuation studies noted that many studies reviewed had shortcomings such as failing to clearly mention the methodology and prices used to value the forest ecosystem services, double counting, data errors, and so on (Ninan and Inoue 2013).
