      <td>was expected to give a voice to smallholders who are an important stakeholder in Ghana&#8217;s cocoa sector. CREMAs are inclusive\nbecause authority and ownership of natural resources are devolved to local communities who can thus have a voice in influencing CSC\npolicy thereby ensuring equity and adapting CSC to local contexts. However, ensuring the long-term sustainability of CREMAs will help\nto make them a reliable mechanism for farmers to voice their concerns and aspirations, and ensure their independence as a legitimate\ngovernance structure in the long run. The private sector was assigned an important role to popularise climate-smart cocoa production\nin Ghana. However, whether this will work to the advantage of smallholder cocoa producers needs to be seen.</td>

      <td>dominant and have skewed access to resources and markets. Lack of secure tenure (tree rights) where the ownership of shade trees\nand timber vests with the state, bureaucratic and legal hurdles to register trees in their cocoa farms are major constraints that impede\nrealisation of the expected benefits of the CSC programme. This is a great disincentive for small cocoa producers to implement CSC\ninitiatives and nurture the shade tree seedlings and undertake land improvement measures. The state marketing board has the\nmonopoly in buying and marketing of cocoa beans including exports which impeded CREMAs or farming communities from directly\nselling their produce to MNCs and traders. However, many MNCs have been involved in setting up of CREMA or similar structures,\nextending premium prices and non-monetary benefits (access to credit, shade tree seedlings, agrochemicals) thus indirectly securing\ntheir cocoa supply chains. A biased ecological discourse about the benefits of climate-smart agriculture and sustainable intensive\nnarrative, complexities regarding the optimal shade levels for growing cocoa, and dependence on agrochemicals are issues that affect\nthe success and sustainability of the project intervention. Dominance of private sector players especially MNCs in the sector may be\ndetrimental to the interests of smallholder cocoa producers (Nasser et al. 2020).</td>
