      <td>The Global Stocktake aims to assess countries&#8217; collective progress towards the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement in the light\nof the best available science. Historic progress is assessed based on NGHGIs, while expectations of future progress are based on\ncountry climate targets (e.g., NDCs for 2025 or 2030 and long-term strategies for 2050). Scenarios consistent with limiting warming\nwell-below 2&#176;C and 1.5&#176;C developed by IAMs (Chapter 3) are expected to play a key role as benchmarks against which countries&#8217;\naggregated future mitigation pledges will be assessed. This, however, implies that estimates by IAMs and country data used to\nmeasure progress are comparable.</td>

      <td>In fact, there is about 5.5 GtCO yr&#8211;1 difference during 2005&#8211;2015 between global anthropogenic land CO net flux estimates of IAMs\n2 2\nand aggregated NGHGIs, due to different conceptual approaches to what is &#8216;anthropogenic&#8217;. This approach and its implications when\ncomparing climate targets with global mitigation pathways are illustrated in this Box Figure 1a&#8211;e.</td>

      <td>By adjusting the original IAM output (Cross-Chapter Box 6, Figure 1a) with the indirect effects from countries&#8217; managed forest\n(Cross-Chapter Box 6, Figure 1b, estimated by DGVMs, see also Figure 7.6), NGHGI-comparable pathways can be derived (Cross-\nChapter Box 6, Figure 1c). The resulting apparent increase in anthropogenic sink reflects simply a reallocation of a CO flux previously\n2\nlabelled as natural, and thus does not reflect a mitigation action. These changes do not affect non-LULUCF emissions. However,\nsince the atmosphere concentration is a combination of CO emissions from LULUCF and from fossil fuels, the proposed land-related\n2\nadjustments also influence the NGHGI-comparable economy-wide (all sector) CO pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 6, Figure 1d).\n2</td>

      <td>This approach does not imply a change in the original decarbonisation pathways, nor does it suggest that indirect effects should be\nconsidered in the mitigation efforts. It simply ensures that a like-with-like comparison is made: if countries&#8217; climate targets use the\nNGHGI definition of anthropogenic emissions, this same definition can be applied to derive NGHGI-comparable future CO pathways.\n2\nThis would have an impact on the NGHGI-comparable remaining carbonor GHG budget (i.e., the allowable emissions until net zero\nCO or GHG emissions consistent with a certain climate target). For example, for SSP2-1.9 and SSP2-2.6 (representing pathways in\n2\nline with 1.5&#176;C and well-below 2&#176;C limits under SSP2 assumptions), carbon budget is 170 GtCO -eq lower than the original remaining\n2\ncarbon budget according to the models&#8217; approach (Cross-Chapter Box 6, Figure 1e). Similarly, the remaining carbon (or GHG) budgets\nin Chapter 3 (this report), as well as the net zero carbon (or GHG) targets, could only be used in combination with the definition of\nanthropogenic emissions as used by the IAMs (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3). In the absence of these adjustments, collective\nprogress would appear better than it is.</td>
