Data also indicate increased productivity per animal for example, average increases of 16% in beef, 17% in pig meat and 70% in whole (cow) milk per respective animal between 1990 and 2019 (FAO 2021c). Despite these advances leading to reduced emissions per unit of product (calories, meat and milk) (FAO 2016; Tubiello 2019), increased individual animal productivity generally requires increased inputs (e.g.,&#160;feed) and this generates increased emissions (Beauchemin et al. 2020). Manipulation of livestock diets, or improvements in animal genetics or health may counteract some of this. In addition, the production of inputs to facilitate increased animal productivity, may indirectly drive further absolute GHG emissions along the feed supply chain.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="258.62"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.15; y0: 258.62; y1: 268.12; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="258.62" x1="304.76">Although there are several potential drivers (McDermott et al. 2010; Alary et al. 2015), increased livestock production is principally in response to growth in demand for animal-sourced food, driven by a&#160;growing human population (FAO, 2019) and increased consumption resulting from changes in affluence, notably in middle-income countries (Godfray et al. 2018).

Increased yields are in response to increased demand for food, feed, fuel and fibre crops which in turn has been driven by a&#160;growing human population (FAO, 2019), increased demand for animal-sourced food and bioenergy policy (OECD/FAO 2019). Global crop production is projected to increase by almost 15% over the next decade, with low income and emerging regions with greater availability of land and labour resources expected to experience the strongest growth, and account for about 50% of global output growth (OECD/FAO 2019).
