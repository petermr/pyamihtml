Adoption of new mitigation practices, however, may proceed quickly if the technologies can be shown to improve crop yields, reduce costs, or otherwise improve livelihoods (Ranjan 2019). AR6 presents new estimates of the mitigation potential for shifts in diets and reductions in food waste, but given long-standing dietary traditions within most cultures, some of the strongest barriers exist for efforts to change diets (</span><span style="x0: 82.68; x1: 89.53; y0: 582.62; y1: 592.12; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="82.68" y0="582.62" x1="156.87">medium confidence</span><span style="x0: 156.87; x1: 159.51; y0: 582.62; y1: 592.12; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="156.87" y0="582.62" x1="304.76">). Furthermore, the large number of undernourished who may benefit from increased calories and meat will complicate efforts to change diets. Regulatory or tax approaches will face strong resistance, while efforts to use educational approaches and voluntary measures have limited potential to slow changes in consumption patterns due to free-riders, rebound effects, and other limitations. Food loss and waste occurs across the supply chain, creating significant challenges to reduce it (FAO 2019c). Where food loss occurs in the production stage, in other words, in fields at harvest, there may be opportunities to align reductions in food waste with improved production efficiency, however, adoption of new production methods often requires new investments or changes in labour practices, both of which are barriers.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="244.13" top="414.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 414.48; y1: 424.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="414.48" x1="244.13">7.6.4.2 Institutional Barriers and Opportunities</span></div><div left="56.69" right="223.75" top="390.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.26; y0: 390.6; y1: 400.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.69" y0="390.6" x1="223.75">Transparent and accountable governance. </span><span style="x0: 223.53; x1: 229.35; y0: 390.6; y1: 400.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="223.53" y0="390.6" x1="304.72">Good governance and accountability are crucial for implementation of forest and agriculture mitigation. Effective nature-based mitigation will require large-scale estimation, modelling, monitoring, reporting and verification of GHG inventories, mitigation actions, as well as their implications for sustainable development goals and their interactions with climate change impacts and adaptation. Efforts must be made to integrate the accounting from projects to the country level. While global datasets have emerged to measure forest loss, at least temporarily (e.g.,&#160;Hansen et al. 2013), similar datasets do not yet exist for forest degradation and agricultural carbon stocks or fluxes. Most developing countries have insufficient capacity to address research needs, modelling, monitoring, reporting and data requirements (Ravindranath et al. 2017), compromising transparency, accuracy, completeness, consistency and comparability.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.72" top="198.63"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.51; y0: 198.63; y1: 208.13; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="198.63" x1="304.72">Opportunity for political participation of local stakeholders is barrier in most places where forest ownership rights are not sufficiently documented (Essl et al. 2018). Since incentives for self-enforcement can have an important influence on deforestation rates (Fortmann et al. 2017), weak governance and insecure property rights are significant barriers to introduction of forest carbon offset projects in developing countries, where many of the low-cost options for such projects exist (Gren and Zeleke 2016). Governance challenges exist at all levels of government, with poor coordination, insufficient information sharing, and concerns over accountability playing a&#160;prominent role within REDD+ projects and programmes (Ravikumar et al. 2015). In some cases, governments are increasingly centralising REDD+ governance and limiting the distribution of governance </span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.24" top="726.64"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 317.86; y0: 726.64; y1: 736.14; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="726.64" x1="563.24">functions between state and non-state actors (Zelli et al. 2017; Phelps et al. 2010).

Some positive signs exist as over 500 million hectares of forests have been converted to community management with clear property rights in the past two decades (Rights and Resources Initiative 2018), but adoption of forest and agricultural mitigation practices will be limited in large remaining areas with unclear property rights (Gupta et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="315.22" right="440.79" top="498.67"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.43; y0: 498.67; y1: 508.17; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="315.22" y0="498.67" x1="440.79">Lack of institutional capacity. </span><span style="x0: 442.65; x1: 444.95; y0: 498.67; y1: 508.17; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="442.65" y0="498.67" x1="563.26">Institutional complexity, or lack thereof, represents a&#160;major challenge when implementing large and complex mitigation programmes (e.g.,&#160;REDD+) in agriculture, forest and other land uses (B&#228;ckstrand et al. 2017).

To support large-scale CDR, these scenarios involve significant land-use change, due to afforestation/reforestation, avoided deforestation, and deployment of biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). While a&#160;considerable amount of land is certainly available for new forests or new bioenergy crops, that land has current uses that will affect not only the costs, but also the willingness of current users or owners, to shift uses. Regions with private property rights and a&#160;history of market-based transactions may be the most feasible for land-use change or land management change to occur.
