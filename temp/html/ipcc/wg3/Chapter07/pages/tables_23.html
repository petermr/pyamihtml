If poorly planned, infrastructure can facilitate fires, illegal mining, and wildlife poaching with\nconsequences for GHG emissions and biodiversity conservation. However, some initiatives are providing new approaches for better\nplanning and then limit environmental and societal impacts.</td>

For example, the total area of intact wilderness is declining rapidly worldwide (Watson\net al. 2016), 70% of the world&#8217;s forests are now less than 1 km from a forest edge (Haddad et al. 2015), the extent of tropical forest\nfragmentation is accelerating exponentially (Taubert et al. 2018). One of the most direct and immediate driver of deforestation and\nbiodiversity decline is the dramatic expansion of roads and other transportation infrastructure (Laurance et al. 2014a; Laurance\nand Arrea 2017; Alamgir et al. 2017).</td>

Environmental\nImpact Assessments (EIAs) for roads and other infrastructure are typically too short term and superficial to detect rare species or\nassess long-term or indirect impacts of projects (Flyvbjerg 2009; Laurance and Arrea 2017). Another limitation is the consideration\nof each project in isolation from other existing or planned developments (Laurance et al. 2014b). Hence, EIAs alone are inadequate\nfor planning infrastructure projects and assessing their broader environmental, social, and financial impacts and risks (Laurance et al.\n2015a; Alamgir et al. 2017, 2018).</td>

For example, the Global Roadmap strategy has\nbeen used in parts of South-East Asia (Sloan et al. 2018), Indochina (Balmford et al. 2016), and sub-Saharan Africa (Laurance et al.\n2015b) to devise land-use zoning that can help optimise the many risks and rewards of planned infrastructure projects.</td>
