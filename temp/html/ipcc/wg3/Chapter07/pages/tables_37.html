With the right set of incentives in place at EU and member states\n2\nlevels, it was found that the EU-28 has the potential to achieve an additional combined mitigation impact through the implementation\nof CSF of 441 MtCO yr&#8211;1 by 2050. Also, with the Green Deal and its biodiversity and forest strategy, more emphasis will be placed on\n2\nforests, forest management and the provision of renewables. It is the diversity of measures (from strict reserves to more intensively\nmanaged systems while adapting the resource) that will determine the success. Only with co-benefits in, for example, nature\nconservation, soil protection, and provision of renewables, wood for buildings and income, the mitigation and adaptation measures\nwill be successful.</td>

Pilots and projects are being implemented by a variety of forest owners, some with more attention\non biodiversity and adaptation, some with more attention on production functions. They establish examples and in longer term the\noutreach to the 16 million private owners in Europe. However, the right triggers and incentives are often still lacking. For example,\nadapting the spruce forest areas in Central Europe to climate change requires knowledge about different species, biodiversity and\ndifferent management options and eventually use in industry. It requires alternative species to be available from the nurseries, as well\nas improved monitoring to assess the success and steer activities.</td>
