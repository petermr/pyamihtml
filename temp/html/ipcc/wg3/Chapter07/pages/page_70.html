Although more impact evaluation (IE) analysis needs to be conducted on REDD+ payments, these studies support the country-level estimates of carbon benefits from REDD+ shown in Table&#160;7.4.

However, a&#160;review of the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPAs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), NAMAs, and NDCs in the Paris Agreement suggest an increasing focus of policy makers on agriculture and food security. The vast majority of parties to the Paris Agreement recognise the significant role of agriculture in supporting a&#160;secure sustainable development pathway (Richards and VanWey 2015) with the inclusion of agriculture mitigation in 103 NDCs from a&#160;total of 160 NDC submissions.

Under the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU, up to 30% of the direct payments to farmers (Pillar&#160;1) have been green payments (Henderson et al. 2020), including some actions that could increase carbon storage or reduce emissions. Similarly, at least 30% of the rural development payments (Pillar 2) are used for measures that reduce environmental impact, including reduction of GHG emissions and carbon storage.
