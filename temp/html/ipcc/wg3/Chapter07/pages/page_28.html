If implemented with benefits to human well-being and biodiversity, land-based mitigation measures are often referred to as nature-based solutions and/or natural climate solutions (Glossary). Measures that result in a&#160;net removal of GHGs from the atmosphere and storage in either living or dead organic material, or in geological stores, are known as CDR, and in previous IPCC reports were sometimes referred to as greenhouse gas removal (GGR) or negative emissions technologies (NETs) (Rogelj et al. 2018a; Jia et al. 2019). This section evaluates current knowledge and latest scientific literature on AFOLU mitigation measures and potentials, including land-based CDR measures. Section&#160;7.4.1 provides an overview of the approaches for estimating mitigation potential, the co-benefits and risks from land-based mitigation measures, estimated global and regional mitigation potential and associated costs according to literature published over the last decade. Subsequent subsections assess literature on 20 key AFOLU mitigation measures specifically providing:</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.06" top="414.63"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.77; y0: 414.63; y1: 424.13; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="414.63" x1="299.06">&#8226; A description of activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities and barriers.</span><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.77; y0: 390.64; y1: 400.14; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="51.02" y0="390.64" x1="58.24">&#8226; </span><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 390.64; y1: 400.14; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="390.64" x1="299.08">A summary of conclusions in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and IPCC Special Reports (Special Report on Climate Change of 1.5&#176;C (SR1.5), Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a&#160;Changing Climate (SROCC) and Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL)).</span><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.77; y0: 330.64; y1: 340.14; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="51.02" y0="330.64" x1="58.24">&#8226; </span><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 330.64; y1: 340.14; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="330.64" x1="299.04">An overview of literature and developments since the AR5 and IPCC Special Reports. &#8226; An assessment and conclusion based on current evidence.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.09" top="282.65"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 58.41; y0: 282.65; y1: 292.15; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="282.65" x1="299.09">Measures are categorised as supply-side activities in: (i) forests and other ecosystems (Section&#160;7.4.2); (ii) agriculture (Section&#160;7.4.3); (iii)&#160;bioenergy and other land-based energy technologies (Section&#160;7.4.4); as well as (iv) demand-side activities (Section&#160;7.4.5 and Figure&#160;7.11).

Novel measures, including enhanced weathering and novel foods are covered in Chapter&#160;12, this report. In addition, as mitigation within AFOLU concerns land management and use of land resources, AFOLU measures impact other sectors. Accordingly, AFOLU measures are also discussed in other sectoral chapters within this report, notably demand-side solutions (Chapter&#160;5), bioenergy and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) (Chapter&#160;6), the use of wood products and biomass in buildings (Chapter&#160;9), and CDR measures, food systems and land related impacts, risks and opportunities of mitigation measures (Chapter&#160;12).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="464.0" top="726.48"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.74; y0: 726.48; y1: 736.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="309.54" y0="726.48" x1="464.0">7.4.1 Introduction and Overview of&#160;Mitigation Potential</span></div><div left="309.54" right="470.85" top="690.48"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.34; y0: 690.48; y1: 700.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="690.48" x1="470.85">7.4.1.1 Estimating Mitigation Potentials</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.61" top="666.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 316.93; y0: 666.6; y1: 676.1; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="666.6" x1="557.61">Mitigation potentials for AFOLU measures are estimated by calculating the scale of emissions reductions or carbon sequestration against a&#160;counterfactual scenario without mitigation activities. The types of mitigation potential estimates in recent literature include: (i) technical potential (the biophysical potential or amount possible with current technologies); (ii) economic potential (constrained by costs, usually by a&#160;given carbon price (Table&#160;7.3); (iii) sustainable potential (constrained by environmental safeguards and/or natural resources, e.g.,&#160;limiting natural forest conversion), and (iv) feasible potential (constrained by environmental, socio-cultural, and/or institutional barriers), however, there are no set definitions used in literature. In addition to types of mitigation estimates, there are two AFOLU mitigation categories often calculated: supply-side measures (land management interventions) and demand-side measures (interventions that require a&#160;change in consumer behaviour).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.59" top="474.63"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.76; y0: 474.63; y1: 484.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="474.63" x1="557.59">Two main approaches to estimating mitigation potentials include: (i) studies on individual measures and/or sectors&#160;&#8211; henceforth referred to as sectoral assessments, and (ii) integrated assessment models (IAM). Sectoral assessments include studies focusing on one activity (e.g.,&#160;agroforestry) based on spatial and biophysical data, as well as econometric and optimisation models for a&#160;sector, for example, the forest or agriculture sector, and therefore cover a&#160;large suite of practices and activities while representing a&#160;broad body of literature. Sectoral assessments, however, rarely capture cross-sector interactions or impacts, making it difficult to completely account for land competition, trade-offs, and double counting when aggregating sectoral estimates across different studies and methods (Smith et al. 2014; Jia et al. 2019). On the other hand, IAMs assess the climate impact of multiple and interlinked practices across sectors and therefore, can account for interactions and trade-offs (including land competition, use of other resources and international trade) between them. However, the number of land-based measures used in IAMs are limited compared with the sectoral portfolio (Figure&#160;7.11). The resolution of land-based measures in IAMs are also generally coarser compared to some sectoral estimates, and as such, may be less robust for individual measures (Roe et al. 2021). Given the differences between and strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, it is helpful to compare the estimates from both. We combine estimates from both approaches to establish an updated range of global land- based mitigation potential.</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.62" top="162.66"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.59; y0: 162.66; y1: 172.16; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="162.66" x1="557.62">For the 20 land-based mitigation measures outlined in this section, the mitigation potential estimates are largely derived from sectoral approaches, and where data is available, are compared to IAM estimates.
