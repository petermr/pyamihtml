      <td>(using GWP100 and IPCC AR4 values) with a technical mitigation potential of 85.5 MtCO -eq yr&#8211;1 through the adoption of various\n2\nmitigation practices. About 80% of the technical mitigation potential could be achieved by adopting cost-saving measures.\nThree mitigation options, for example, efficient use of fertiliser, zero-tillage, and rice-water management, could deliver more than 50%\nof the total technical abatement potential. Under the BAU scenario the projected GHG emissions from major crop and livestock species\nis estimated at 489 MtCO -eq in 2030, whereas under mitigation scenario GHG emissions are estimated at 410 MtCO -eq implying\n2 2\na technical mitigation option of about 78.67 MtCO -eq yr&#8211;1 (Box 7.6, Figure 1). Major sources of projected emissions under the BAU\n2\nscenario, in order of importance, were cattle, rice, buffalo, and small ruminants. Although livestock production and rice cultivation\naccount for a major share of agricultural emissions, the highest mitigation potential was observed in rice (about 36 MtCO -eq yr&#8211;1)\n2\nfollowed by buffalo (about 14 MtCO -eq yr&#8211;1), wheat (about 11 MtCO -eq yr&#8211;1) and cattle (about 7 MtCO -eq yr&#8211;1). Crops such as\n2 2 2\ncotton and sugarcane each offered mitigation potential of about 5 MtCO -eq yr&#8211;1 while the mitigation potential from small ruminants\n2\n(goat/sheep) was about 2 MtCO -eq yr&#8211;1.\n2</td>

      <td>Sapkota et al. (2019) also estimated the magnitude of GHG savings\nper year through adoption of various mitigation measures, together\nwith the total cost and net cost per unit of CO -eq abated. When\n2\nthe additional benefits of increased yield due to adoption of the\nmitigation measures were considered, about 80% of the technical\nmitigation potential (67.5 out of 85.5 MtCO-eq) could be achieved\n2\nby cost-saving measures. When yield benefits were considered,\ngreen fodder supplements to ruminant diets were the most cost-\neffective mitigation measure, followed by vermicomposting\nand improved diet management of small ruminants. Mitigation\nmeasures such as fertigation and micro-irrigation, various methods\nof restoring degraded land and feed additives in livestock appear\nto be cost-prohibitive, even when considering yield benefits, if\nany. The study accounted for GHG emissions at the farm level\nand excluded emissions arising due to processing, marketing or\nconsumption post farm-gate. It also did not include emissions\nfrom feed production, since livestock in India mostly rely on crop\nBox 7.6, Figure 1 | Contribution of various crops and livestock\nby-products and concentrates. Further the potential of laser land species to total agricultural emission in 2012 (baseline) and by 2030\nlevelling seems exaggerated which may also be redundant with under business as usual (BAU) and mitigation scenarios for Indian\nalready accounted potential from &#8216;improved water management agricultural sector.
