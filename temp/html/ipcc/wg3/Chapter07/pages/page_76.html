The concept was explored within the SRCCL (SRCCL (Mbow et al. 2019), Section&#160;5.6.4.4 and Cross-Chapter Box&#160;6 in Chapter&#160;5). SI is context specific and dynamic, with no universally prescribed methodology (HLPE 2019). Equal importance is given to enhancing sustainability as to achieving agricultural intensification.

However, changes in agricultural land use and degradation of natural resources (UNEP 2019; IPBES 2019b) suggests that not all of this intensification is sustainable. Although agricultural intensification has led to less GHG emissions compared to a&#160;scenario where that intensification had not taken place (Burney et al. 2010), absolute agriculture related emissions have continued to increase (Section&#160;7.2). Active pursuit of SI was found to be expanding, with implementation on an increasing area, notably in developing countries (Pretty et al. 2018), yet regional agricultural area expansion at the expense of native habitat also continues in such regions (Section&#160;7.3). Although there are specific examples of SI (Box&#160;7.13) global progress in achieving SI is acknowledged as slow (Cassman and Grassini 2020) with potentially multiple, context specific geophysical and socio-economic barriers to implementation (Firbank et al. 2018; da Silva et al. 2021).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="276.97" top="174.48"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.39; y0: 174.48; y1: 184.48; width: 5.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="174.48" x1="276.97">Preconditions to ensure sustainable intensification</span><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 67.84; y0: 162.6; y1: 172.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="162.6" x1="543.64">Increasing the total amount of product produced by improving production efficiency (output per unit of input) does not guarantee SI.&#160;</span><span style="x0: 121.02; x1: 123.32; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="121.02" y0="150.6" x1="543.37">It will only be successful if increased production efficiency translates into reduced environmental and social impacts as well as increased production.
