The following analysis aligns with the drivers typology used by IPBES (2019b) and the Global Environmental Outlook (UNEP 2019). Drivers are divided into direct drivers resulting from human decisions and actions concerning land use and land-use change, and indirect drivers that operate by altering the level or rate of change of one or more direct drivers. Although drivers of emissions in agriculture and FOLU are presented separately, they are interlinked, operating in many complex ways at different temporal and spatial scales, with outcomes depending on their interactions. For example, deforestation in tropical forests is a&#160;significant component of sectorial emissions. A&#160;review of deforestation drivers&#8217; studies published between 1996 and 2013, indicated a&#160;wide range of factors associated with deforestation rates across many analyses and studies, covering different regions (Busch and Ferretti-Gallon 2017) (Figure&#160;7.9). Higher agricultural prices were identified as a&#160;key driver of deforestation, while law enforcement, area protection, and ecosystem services payments were found to be important drivers of reduced deforestation, while timber activity did not show a&#160;consistent impact.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="544.23" top="726.48"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.41; y0: 726.48; y1: 736.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="315.21" y0="726.48" x1="544.23">7.3.1 Anthropogenic Direct Drivers: Deforestation, Conversion of Other Ecosystems, and Land Degradation</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.22" top="678.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 678.6; y1: 688.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="678.6" x1="563.22">The global forest area in 2020 is estimated at 4.1 billion ha, representing 31% of the total land area (FAO 2020a). Most forests are situated in the tropics (45%), followed by boreal (27%), temperate (16%) and subtropical (11%) domains. Considering regional distribution of global forest area, Europe and the Russian Federation accounts for 25%, followed by South America (21%), North and Central America (19%), Africa (16%), Asia (15%) and Oceania (5%). However, a&#160;significant share (54%) of the world&#8217;s forest area concerns five countries&#160;&#8211; The Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the USA and China (FAO 2020a). Forest loss rates differ among regions though the global trend is towards a&#160;net forest loss (UNEP 2019). The global forest area declined by about 178 Mha in the 30 years from 1990 to 2020 (FAO 2020a). The rate of net forest loss has decreased since 1990, a&#160;result of reduced deforestation in some countries and forest gains in others. The annual net loss of forest area declined from 7.8 Mha in 1990&#8211;2000, to 5.2 Mha in 2000&#8211;2010, to 4.7 Mha in 2010&#8211;2020, while the total growing stock in global forests increased (FAO 2020a). The rate of decline in net forest loss during the last decade was due mainly to an increase in the rate of forest gain (i.e., afforestation and the natural expansion of forests).</span></div><div left="162.39" right="551.56" top="115.35"><span style="x0: 162.39; x1: 166.64; y0: 115.35; y1: 123.85; width: 4.25; font-size: 8.5; fill: [0.402]; stroke: [0.613, 0.618, 0.625]; font-family: TLAJFA+FrutigerLTStd-Cn;" x0="162.39" y0="115.35" x1="551.56">&#8211;9&#8211;8&#8211;7&#8211;6&#8211;5&#8211;4&#8211;3&#8211;2&#8211;10123456789</span></div><div left="81.04" right="158.6" top="129.91"><span style="x0: 81.04; x1: 85.92; y0: 129.91; y1: 138.41; width: 4.88; font-size: 8.5; fill: [0.402]; stroke: [0.613, 0.618, 0.625]; font-family: TLAJFA+FrutigerLTStd-Cn;" x0="81.04" y0="129.91" x1="158.6">Higher agricultural price Rural income support Nearer to agriculture Greater population Nearer to urban area Nearer to roads Greater soil suitability Agricultural activity Nearer to cleared land Nearer to water Timber activity Greater education More secure land tenure Community forestry Wetter Higher timber price Larger property size Greater poverty Older population Steeper slope Presence of indigenous peoples Higher elevation Payments (PES) Protected area Law enforcement</span></div><div left="191.73" right="250.1" top="401.82"><span style="x0: 191.73; x1: 195.19; y0: 401.82; y1: 410.32; width: 3.46; font-size: 8.5; fill: [0.402]; stroke: [0.613, 0.618, 0.625]; font-family: TLAJFA+FrutigerLTStd-Cn;" x0="191.73" y0="401.82" x1="250.1">Less deforestation More deforestation Not consistent</span></div><div left="166.18" right="498.5" top="98.82"><span style="x0: 166.18; x1: 169.17; y0: 98.82; y1: 105.82; width: 2.98; font-size: 7.0; fill: [0.402]; stroke: [0.613, 0.618, 0.625]; font-family: TLAJFA+FrutigerLTStd-Cn;" x0="166.18" y0="98.82" x1="498.5">For each category of explanatory variables (left-hand side), the meta-analysis determined whether the driver variables in that category were consistently associated with higher rates of deforestation, lower rates of deforestation, or neither (not consistent).For example, a ratio of &#8211;4x indicates that a variable is associated with less deforestation four times as often as it is associated with more deforestation.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="309.2" top="55.19"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.4; y0: 55.19; y1: 63.19; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0.339]; stroke: [0.613, 0.618, 0.625]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.69" y0="55.19" x1="309.2">Figure&#160;7.9 | Association of driver variables with more or less deforestation. </span><span style="x0: 309.2; x1: 312.61; y0: 55.19; y1: 63.19; width: 3.41; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0.613, 0.618, 0.625]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="309.2" y0="55.19" x1="526.95">Source: reproduced with permission from Busch and Ferretti-Gallon (2017).</span></div></body></html>
