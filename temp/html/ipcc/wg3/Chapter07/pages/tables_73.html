This broader inclusion resulted from a long process of insertion and articulation in the government dating\nback to 2003 while elaborating on the Sustainable Amazon Plan. In May 2003, a historic meeting took place in an Amazonian city,\nwith the president of the Republic, state governors, ministers, and various business leaders, civil institutions, and social movements. It\nwas presented and approved the document entitled &#8216;Sustainable Amazonia &#8211; Guidelines and Priorities of the Ministry of Environment\nfor the Sustainable Development of the Amazon Brazilian&#8217;, containing several guidelines for conservation and sustainable use in the\nregion. At the meeting, the Union and some states signed a Cooperation Agreement aiming to elaborate a plan for the Amazon, to be\nwidely discussed with the various sectors of the regional and national society (Ministerio do Meio Ambiente, MMA, 2013).</td>

      <td>of sustainable practices. During the execution of the 1st and 2nd phases of the PPCDAm (2004&#8211;2011), important results in the\nterritorial management and land-use component included, for example, the creation of 25 Mha of federal Protected Areas (PAs)\nlocated mainly in front of the expansion of deforestation, as well as the homologation of 10 Mha of Indigenous Lands. Also, states\nand municipalities created approximately 25 Mha, so that all spheres of government contributed to the expansion of PAs in the\nBrazilian Amazon. In the &#8216;command and control&#8217; component, agencies performed hundreds of inspection operations against illegal\nactivities (e.g., illegal logging) under strategic planning based on technical and territorial priorities. Besides, there was a significant\nimprovement of the environmental monitoring systems, involving the analysis of satellite images to guide actions on the ground.\nAnother policy was the restriction of public credit to enterprises linked to illegal deforestation following a resolution of the Brazilian\nCentral Bank (2008) (Ministerio do Meio Ambiente, MMA, 2013). Also, in 2008, Brazil created the Amazon Fund, a REDD+ mechanism\n(Government of Brazil, n.d.).</td>

      <td>However, the country&#8217;s political polarisation has gradually eroded environmental governance, especially after the Brazilian Forest\nCode changes in 2012 (major environmental law in Brazil), the presidential impeachment in 2016, presidential elections in 2018, and\nthe start of the new federal administration in 2019. Successful deforestation control policies are being negatively affected by critical\nchanges in the political context, and weakening the environmental rule of law, forest conservation, and sustainable development\nprogrammes (for example, changes in the Amazon Fund governance in disagreement with the main donors). In 2019, the annual\ndeforestation rate reached 10,129 km2 being the first time it surpassed 10,000 km2 since 2008 (INPE, 2021). Besides, there has been\nno effective transition from the historical economic model to a sustainable one. The lack of clarity in the ownership of land is still\na major unresolved issue in the Amazon.</td>
