      <td>plants from heat and water stress, enhance soil organic matter and water holding capacity of soils, and provide other assistance with\nagroforestry, giving access to extension services such as agronomic information and agrochemical inputs. The shade tree seedlings\nwere distributed by NGOs, government extension agencies, and the private sector free of charge or at subsidised prices and was\nexpected to reduce pressure on forests for growing cocoa plants. The CSC programme was mainly targeted at small farmers who\nconstitute about 80% of total farm holdings in Ghana. Although the government extension agency (Cocobod) undertook mass spraying\nor pruning of cocoa farms they found it difficult to access the 800,000 cocoa smallholders spread across the tropical south of the\ncountry. The project brought all stakeholders together, in other words, the government, private sector, local farmers and civil society or\nNGOs to facilitate the sustainable intensification of cocoa production in Ghana. Creation of a community-based governance structure\nwas expected to promote benefit sharing, forest conservation, adaptation to climate change, and enhanced livelihood opportunities.</td>
