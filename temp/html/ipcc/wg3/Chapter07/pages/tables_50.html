      <td>maintaining and where appropriate, increase overall production. The SRCCL identified several farming system approaches, deemed\nalternative to conventional systems (Olsson et al. 2019; Mbow et al. 2019; L.G. Smith et al. 2019). These may incorporate several of the\nmitigation measures described in Section 7.4.3, while potentially also delivering environmental co-benefits. This Box assesses evidence\nspecifically on the mitigation capacity of some such system approaches. The approaches are not mutually exclusive, may share similar\nprinciples or practices and can be complimentary. In all cases, mitigation may result from either (i) emission reductions or (ii) enhanced\ncarbon sequestration, via combinations of management practices as outlined in Figure 1 within this Box. The approaches will have\npros and cons concerning multiple factors, including mitigation, yield and co-benefits, with trade-offs subject to the diverse contexts\nand ways in which they are implemented.</td>
