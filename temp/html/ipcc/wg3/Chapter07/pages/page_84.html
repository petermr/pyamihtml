Land-based mitigation and adaptation to the risks posed by climate change and extreme weather events can have several co-benefits as well as help promote development and conservation goals. Land-based mitigation and adaptation will not only help reduce GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector, but measures are required to closely link up with adaptation. In the central 2&#176;C scenario, improved management of land and more efficient forest practices, a&#160;reduction in deforestation and an increase in afforestation, would account for 10% of the total mitigation effort over 2015&#8211;2050 (Keramidas et al. 2018). If managed and regulated appropriately, the Land sector could become carbon-neutral as early as 2030&#8211;2035, being a&#160;key sector for emissions reductions beyond 2025 (Keramidas et al. 2018).
