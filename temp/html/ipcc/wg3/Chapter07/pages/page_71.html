A&#160;review of land sparing and land sharing policies in developing countries indicated that most of them follow land sparing models, sometimes in combination with land sharing approaches. However, there is still no clear evidence of which policy provides the best results for ecosystem services provision, conservation, and livelihoods (Mertz and Mertens 2017). The literature contains a&#160;wide range of results on the effectiveness of protected areas to reduce deforestation (Burivalova et al. 2019), with studies suggesting that protected areas provide significant protection of forests (e.g.,&#160;Blackman 2015), modest protection (Andam et al. 2008), as well as increases in deforestation (Blackman 2015) and possible leakage of harvesting to elsewhere (Kallio et al. 2018). An estimate of the contributions of protected areas to mitigation between 2000 and 2012, showed that in the tropics, PAs reduced carbon emissions from deforestation by 4.88 PgC, or around 29%, when compared to the expected rates of deforestation (Bebber and Butt 2017).

Examples are S&#246;dra in Sweden (with 52,000 forest owners) (S&#246;dra, 2021) or Waldbauernverband in North-Rhine Westphalia (with 150,000 forest owners and covering 585,000 ha) (AGDW-The Forest Owners, 2021). These are ways for small forest owners to educate, jointly put wood on the market, employ better forest management, use machinery together, and apply certification jointly. In this manner and with all their diversity of goals, they manage to maintain carbon sinks and stocks, while preserving biodiversity and producing wood.</span></div></body></html>
