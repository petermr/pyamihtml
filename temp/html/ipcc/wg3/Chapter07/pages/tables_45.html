While complex systems are more effective in the mitigation of climate change, trade-offs with scalability need to be resolved\nfor agroforestry systems to deliver on their potential. The Brazilian-Dutch CANOPIES project (Janssen 2020) is exploring transition\npathways to agroforestry systems optimised for local ecological and socio-economic conditions.</td>

      <td>farmers and researchers are pioneering diverse ways of integrating trees into croplands, from planting rows of eucalyptus trees in\npastures up to highly complex agroforests consisting of &gt;30 crop and tree species. The degree of complexity influences the multiple\nfunctions that farmers and societies can attain from agroforestry: the more complex it is, the more it resembles a natural forest with\nassociated benefits for its carbon storage capacity and its habitat quality for biodiversity (Santos et al. 2019). However, trade-offs\nexist between the complexity and scalability of agroforestry as complex systems rely on intensive manual labour to achieve high\nproductivity (Tscharntke et al. 2011). To date, mechanisation of structurally diverse agroforests is scarce and hence, efficiencies of\nscale are difficult to achieve.</td>
