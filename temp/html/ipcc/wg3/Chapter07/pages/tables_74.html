In addition to the\ncarbon benefits, these agroforestry systems decrease erosion, provide animal fodder, recharge groundwater, generate nutrition and\nincome benefits and act as safety nets for vulnerable rural households during climate and other shocks (Bayala et al. 2014, 2015;\nBinam et al. 2015; Sinare and Gordon 2015; Ilstedt et al. 2016).</td>

      <td>volatility and local policy reform have all likely played a role (Haglund et al. 2011; Sendzimir et al. 2011; Brandt et al. 2019a; Garrity and\nBayala 2019); the easing of forestry regulations has been particularly critical in giving farmers greater control over the management\nand use of trees on their land (Garrity et al. 2010). This policy shift was catalysed by greater regional autonomy resulting from\neconomic decline and coincided with successful pilots and NGO-led experimentation, cash-for-work, and training efforts to support\nchanges in land management (Sendzimir et al. 2011). Participation of farmers in planning and implementation helped align actions\nwith local knowledge and goals as well as market opportunities.</td>

      <td>Regreening takes place when dormant seed or tree stumps sprout and are cultivated through the technique, called Farmer Managed\nNatural Regeneration (FMNR). Without planting new trees, FMNR is presumed to be cheaper than other approaches to restoration,\nthough comparative economic analysis has yet to be conducted (Chomba et al. 2020). Relatively lower investment costs are believed\nto have contributed to the replication across the landscape. These factors worked together to contribute to a groundswell of action\nthat affected rights, access, and use of local resources (Tougiani et al. 2009).</td>

      <td>Regreening in the Sahel and the consequent transformation of the landscape has resulted from the actions of hundreds of thousands\nof individuals responding to social and biophysical signals (Hanan 2018). This is an example for climate change mitigation, where\neliminating regulations &#8211; versus increasing them &#8211; has led to carbon dioxide removal.</td>
