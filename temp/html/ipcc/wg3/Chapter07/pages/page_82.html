Land degradation has had a&#160;pronounced impact on ecosystem functions worldwide (IPBES 2018e). Net primary productivity of ecosystem biomass and of agriculture is presently lower than it would have been under a&#160;natural state on 23% of the global terrestrial area, amounting to a&#160;5% reduction in total global net primary productivity (IPBES 2018e). Over the past two centuries, soil organic carbon, an indicator of soil health, has seen an estimated 8% loss globally (176&#160;GtC) from land conversion and unsustainable land management practices (IPBES 2018e). Projections to 2050 predict further losses of 36 GtC from soils, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. These losses are projected to come from the expansion of agricultural land into natural areas (16 GtC), degradation due to inappropriate land management (11 GtC) and the draining and burning of peatlands (9&#160;GtC) and melting of permafrost (IPBES 2018e). Trends in biodiversity measured by the global living planet index between 1970 to 2016 indicate a&#160;68% decline in monitored population of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish (WWF 2020). FAO&#8217;s recent report on the state of the world&#8217;s biodiversity for food and agriculture points to an alarming decline in biodiversity for food and agriculture including associated biodiversity such as pollination services, microorganisms which are essential for production systems (FAO 2019d). These suggest that overall ecosystem health is consistently declining with adverse consequences for good quality of life, human well-being, and sustainable development.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.05" top="390.64"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.48; y0: 390.64; y1: 400.14; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="390.64" x1="299.05">Although numerous studies have estimated the value of ecosystem services for different sites, ecosystems, and regions, these studies mostly evaluate ecosystem services at a&#160;single point in time (Costanza&#160;et al. 1997; Xue and Tisdell 2001; Nahuelhual et al. 2007; </span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.59" top="726.65"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 314.12; y0: 726.65; y1: 736.15; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="726.65" x1="557.59">de Groot et al. 2012; Ninan and Kontoleon 2016). The few studies that have assessed the trends in the value of ecosystem services provided by different ecosystems across regions and countries indicate a&#160;declining trend (Costanza et al. 2014; Kubiszewski et al. 2017). Land-use change is a&#160;major driver behind loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in most regions (IPBES 2018b; IPBES 2018c, IPBES 2018d, Rice et al. 2018). Projected impacts of land-use change and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (material and regulating services) between 2015 to 2050 were assessed to have relatively less negative impacts under global sustainability scenarios as compared to regional competition and economic optimism scenarios (IPBES 2019a). The projected impacts were based on a&#160;subset of Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and GHG emissions trajectories (RCP) developed in support of IPCC assessments. There are synergies, trade-offs and co-benefits between ecosystem services and mitigation options with impacts on ecosystem services differing by scale and contexts (</span><span style="x0: 539.5; x1: 544.08; y0: 534.67; y1: 544.17; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="539.5" y0="534.67" x1="557.62">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 348.43; x1: 351.07; y0: 522.67; y1: 532.17; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="348.43" y0="522.67" x1="557.57">). Measures such as conservation agriculture, agroforestry, soil and water conservation, afforestation, adoption of silvopastoral systems, can help minimise trade-offs between mitigations options and ecosystem services (Duguma et al. 2014). Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is being promoted to enable farmers to make agriculture more sustainable and adapt to climate change (Box&#160;7.4). However, experience with CSA in Africa has not been encouraging. For instance, a&#160;study of climate-smart cocoa production in Ghana shows that due to lack of tenure (tree) rights, bureaucratic and legal hurdles in registering trees in cocoa farms, and other barriers small cocoa producers could not realise the project benefits (Box&#160;7.13). Experience of CSA in some other sub-Saharan African countries and other countries such as Belize too has been constrained by weak extension systems and policy implementation, and other barriers (Arakelyan et al. 2017; Kongsager 2017).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="388.88" top="305.98"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 71.87; y0: 305.98; y1: 317.98; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="305.98" x1="388.88">Box&#160;7.13 | Case Study: Climate-smart Cocoa Production in Ghana</span></div><div left="65.2" right="134.68" top="282.48"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.39; y0: 282.48; y1: 292.48; width: 5.19; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="282.48" x1="134.68">Policy objectives</span></div><div left="65.2" right="511.32" top="258.6"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 67.31; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="258.6" x1="511.32">i.

The shade tree seedlings were distributed by NGOs, government extension agencies, and the private sector free of charge or at subsidised prices and was expected to reduce pressure on forests for growing cocoa plants. The CSC programme was mainly targeted at small farmers who constitute about 80% of total farm holdings in Ghana. Although the government extension agency (Cocobod) undertook mass spraying or pruning of cocoa farms they found it difficult to access the 800,000 cocoa smallholders spread across the tropical south of the country. The project brought all stakeholders together, in other words, the government, private sector, local farmers and civil society or NGOs to facilitate the sustainable intensification of cocoa production in Ghana. Creation of a&#160;community-based governance structure was expected to promote benefit sharing, forest conservation, adaptation to climate change, and enhanced livelihood opportunities.</span></div></body></html>
