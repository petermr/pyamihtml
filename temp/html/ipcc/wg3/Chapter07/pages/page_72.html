According to the Rights and Resources Initiative (2018), the area of forests under community management increased globally by 152 Mha from 2002 to 2017, with over 500 Mha under community management in 2017. Studies have now shown that improved property rights with community forest management can reduce deforestation and increase carbon storage (Deininger and Minten 2002; Alix-Garcia et al. 2005; Alix-Garcia 2007; Bowler et al. 2012; Blackman 2015; Fortmann et al. 2017; Burivalova et al. 2019).

The number of private commitments to reduce deforestation from supply chains has greatly increased in recent years, with at least 865 public commitments by 447 producers, processors, traders, manufacturers and retailers as of December, 2020 (New York Declaration on Forests 2021). Industry partnerships with NGOs, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), have become more widespread and visible in agricultural production. For example, RSPO certifies members all along the supply chain for palm oil and claims around 19% of total production.

However, recent studies have shown that some deforestation from the Amazon was displaced to the Cerrado (Brazilian savannas) region (Moffette and Gibbs 2021), which is a&#160;global hotspot for biodiversity, and has significant carbon stocks. These results illustrate the importance of broadening the scope of supply chain management to minimise or eliminate displacement (Lima et al. 2019). In addition, while voluntary efforts may improve environmental outcomes for a&#160;time, it is not clear that they are sufficient to deliver long-term reductions in deforestation, given the increases in deforestation that have occurred in the Amazon in recent years (Box&#160;7.9). Voluntary efforts would be more effective at slowing deforestation if they present stronger linkages to regulatory or other approaches (Lambin et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="403.09" top="173.98"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 71.87; y0: 173.98; y1: 185.98; width: 6.67; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="173.98" x1="403.09">Box&#160;7.9 | Case Study: Deforestation Control in the Brazilian Amazon</span></div><div left="65.2" right="104.1" top="150.48"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.2; y0: 150.48; y1: 160.48; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="150.48" x1="104.1">Summary</span><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 138.6; y1: 148.1; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="138.6" x1="543.44">Between 2000 and 2004, deforestation rates in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (is a&#160;socio-geographic division containing all nine Brazilian states in the Amazon basin) increased from 18,226 to 27,772 km</span><span style="x0: 311.42; x1: 314.61; y0: 130.64; y1: 137.29; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="311.42" y0="130.64" x1="314.61">2</span><span style="x0: 318.23; x1: 322.1; y0: 126.6; y1: 136.1; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="318.23" y0="126.6" x1="324.91">yr</span><span style="x0: 325.48; x1: 328.8; y0: 130.64; y1: 137.29; width: 3.32; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="325.48" y0="130.64" x1="332.0">&#8211;1</span><span style="x0: 335.62; x1: 340.18; y0: 126.6; y1: 136.1; width: 4.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="335.62" y0="126.6" x1="543.43">2008 (INPE, 2021).
