Most offset registries have strong permanence requirements, although they vary in their specific requirements. The Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) from the Verra programme requires a&#160;pool of additional carbon credits that provides a&#160;buffer against inadvertent losses. The Climate Action Reserve (CAR) protocol for forests requires carbon to remain on the site for 100 years. The carbon on the site will be verified at pre-determined intervals over the life of the project. If carbon is diminished on a&#160;given site, the credits for the site have to be relinquished and the project developer has to use credits from their reserve fund (either other projects or purchased credits) to make up for the loss. Estimates of leakage in forestry projects in AR5 suggest that it can range from 10% to over 90% in the USA (Murray et al. 2004), and 20&#8211;50% in the tropics (Sohngen and Brown 2004) for forest set-asides and reduced harvesting. Carbon offset protocols have made a&#160;variety of assumptions. The Climate Action Reserve (CAR) assumes it is 20% in the USA.&#160;One of the voluntary protocols (Verra) uses specific information about the location of the project to calculate a&#160;location specific leakage factor.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="402.64"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 64.08; y0: 402.64; y1: 412.14; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="402.64" x1="304.76">More recent literature has developed explicit estimates of leakage based on statistical analysis of carbon projects or programs. The literature suggests that there are two economic pathways for leakage (e.g.,&#160;(Roopsind et al. 2019), either through a&#160;shift in output price that occurs when outputs are affected by the policy or programme implementation, as described in (Wear and Murray 2004; Murray et al. 2004; Sohngen and Brown 2004; Gan and McCarl 2007), or through a&#160;shift in input prices and markets, such as for labour or capital, as analysed in (Andam et al. 2008; Alix-Garcia et al. 2012; Honey-Ros&#233;s et al. 2011; Fortmann et al. 2017). Estimates of leakage through product markets (e.g.,&#160;timber prices) have suggested leakage of up to 90% (Sohngen and Brown 2004; Murray et al. 2004; Gan and McCarl 2007; Kallio et al. 2018), while studies that consider shifts in input markets are considerably smaller. The analysis of leakage for the Guyana programme by Roopsind et al. (2019) revealed no statistically significant leakage in Suriname. A&#160;key design feature for any programme to reduce leakage is to increase incentives for complementary mitigation policies to be implemented in areas where leakage may occur. Efforts to continue to draw more forests into carbon policy initiatives will reduce leakage over time Roopsind et al. (2019), suggesting that if NDCs continue to encompass a&#160;broader selection of policies, measures and forests over time, leakage will decline.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="287.51" top="114.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.89; y0: 114.48; y1: 124.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.69" y0="114.48" x1="287.51">7.6.3  Assessment of Current Policies and Potential Future Approaches</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.74" top="78.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 78.6; y1: 88.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="78.6" x1="304.74">The Paris Agreement encourages a&#160;wide range of policy approaches, including REDD+, sustainable management of forests, joint mitigation and adaptation, and emphasises the importance of non-</span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.29" top="726.61"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 318.91; y0: 726.61; y1: 736.11; width: 3.7; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="726.61" x1="563.29">carbon benefits and equity for sustainable development (Martius et al. 2016).
