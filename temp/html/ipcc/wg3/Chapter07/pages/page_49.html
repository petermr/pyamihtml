At the same time, it fosters the understanding of climate change with the implementation of adaptation and mitigation actions, as much as possible. Rural communities and local stakeholders are the leaders of this process, where scientists facilitate their knowledge to be useful for the communities and learn at the same time about challenges but also the capacity those communities have built through time. The portfolio includes weather-smart activities, water-smart practices, seed/breed smart, carbon-/nutrient-smart practices, and institutional-/market-smart activities.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="186.4" top="450.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 73.65; y0: 450.48; y1: 460.48; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="450.48" x1="186.4">Interactions and limitations</span><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="438.6" x1="549.15">The integration of technologies and services that are suitable for the local conditions resulted in many gains for food security and adaptation and for mitigation where appropriate. It was also shown that, in all regions, there is considerable yield advantage when a&#160;portfolio of technologies is used, rather than the isolated use of technologies (Govaerts et al. 2005; Zougmor&#233; et al. 2014). Moreover, farmers are using research results to promote their products as climate-smart leading to increases in their income (Acosta-Alba et al. 2019). However, climatic risk sites and socio-economic conditions together with a&#160;lack of resource availability are key issues constraining agriculture across all five regions.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="103.08" top="354.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.31; y0: 354.48; y1: 364.48; width: 4.44; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="354.48" x1="103.08">Lessons</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.04" top="330.6"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 72.98; y0: 330.6; y1: 340.1; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="330.6" x1="549.04">i. Understanding the priorities, context, challenges, capacity, and characteristics of the territory and the communities regarding climate, as well as the environmental and socio-economic dimensions, is the first step. Then, understanding climate vulnerability in their agricultural systems based on scientific data but also listening to their experience will set the pathway to identify climate- smart agriculture (CSA) options (practices and technologies) to reduce such vulnerability.ii. Building capacity is also a&#160;critical element of the CSV approach, rural families learn about the practices and technologies in a&#160;neighbour&#8217;s house, and as part of the process, families commit to sharing their knowledge with other families, to start a&#160;scaling-out process within the communities. Understanding the relationship between climate and their crop is key, as well as the use of weather forecasts to plan their agricultural activities.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.05" top="222.61"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 222.61; y1: 232.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="222.61" x1="549.05">The assessment of the implementation of the CSA options should be done together with community leaders to understand changes in livelihoods and climate vulnerability.
