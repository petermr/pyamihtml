Overall emission levels had remained similar since the publication of AR4 (Nabuurs et al. 2007). The diverse nature of the sector, its linkage with wider societal, ecological and environmental aspects and the required coordination of related policy, was suggested to make implementation of known and available supply- and demand-side mitigation measures particularly challenging (IPCC 2019). Despite such implementation barriers, the considerable mitigation potential of AFOLU as a&#160;sector on its own and its capacity to contribute to mitigation within other sectors was emphasised, with land-related measures, including bioenergy, estimated as capable of contributing between 20% and 60% of the total cumulative abatement to 2030 identified within transformation pathways (IPCC 2018). However, the vast mitigation potential from AFOLU initially portrayed in literature and in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), as explored in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change of 1.5&#176;C (SR1.5), is being questioned in terms of feasibility (Roe et al. 2021) and a&#160;more balanced perspective on the role of land in mitigation is developing, while at the same time, interest by private investors in land-based mitigation is increasing fast.</span></div><div left="56.7" right="192.22" top="342.63"><span style="x0: 56.7; x1: 60.91; y0: 342.63; y1: 352.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.7" y0="342.63" x1="192.22">The SRCCL (IPCC 2019) outlined with </span><span style="x0: 192.18; x1: 199.04; y0: 342.63; y1: 352.13; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="192.18" y0="342.63" x1="257.54">medium evidence </span><span style="x0: 257.51; x1: 261.9; y0: 342.63; y1: 352.13; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="257.51" y0="342.63" x1="273.33">and </span><span style="x0: 273.3; x1: 280.15; y0: 342.63; y1: 352.13; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="273.3" y0="342.63" x1="304.77">medium agreement </span><span style="x0: 101.78; x1: 104.59; y0: 330.63; y1: 340.13; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="101.78" y0="330.63" x1="304.72">that supply-side agriculture and forestry measures had an economic (at USD100 tCO</span><span style="x0: 188.64; x1: 191.83; y0: 317.41; y1: 324.06; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="188.64" y0="317.41" x1="191.83">2</span><span style="x0: 191.83; x1: 194.64; y0: 318.6; y1: 328.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="191.83" y0="318.6" x1="203.43">-eq</span><span style="x0: 203.43; x1: 206.75; y0: 322.64; y1: 329.29; width: 3.32; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="203.43" y0="322.64" x1="209.94">&#8211;1</span><span style="x0: 209.94; x1: 212.59; y0: 318.6; y1: 328.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="209.94" y0="318.6" x1="304.74">) mitigation potential of 7.2&#8211;10.6 GtCO</span><span style="x0: 109.63; x1: 112.82; y0: 305.41; y1: 312.06; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="109.63" y0="305.41" x1="112.82">2</span><span style="x0: 112.82; x1: 115.63; y0: 306.6; y1: 316.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="112.82" y0="306.6" x1="124.42">-eq</span><span style="x0: 124.42; x1: 127.75; y0: 310.64; y1: 317.29; width: 3.33; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="124.42" y0="310.64" x1="130.94">&#8211;1</span><span style="x0: 132.23; x1: 134.34; y0: 306.6; y1: 316.1; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="132.23" y0="306.6" x1="304.74">in 2030 (using GWP100 and multiple IPCC values for CH</span><span style="x0: 78.59; x1: 81.78; y0: 293.41; y1: 300.06; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="78.59" y0="293.41" x1="81.78">4</span><span style="x0: 83.09; x1: 87.49; y0: 294.6; y1: 304.1; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="83.09" y0="294.6" x1="103.76">and N</span><span style="x0: 103.76; x1: 106.95; y0: 293.41; y1: 300.06; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="103.76" y0="293.41" x1="106.95">2</span><span style="x0: 106.95; x1: 112.76; y0: 294.6; y1: 304.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="106.95" y0="294.6" x1="304.76">O) of which about a&#160;third was estimated as achievable at &lt;USD20 tCO</span><span style="x0: 102.77; x1: 105.97; y0: 281.41; y1: 288.06; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="102.77" y0="281.41" x1="105.97">2</span><span style="x0: 105.97; x1: 108.78; y0: 282.6; y1: 292.1; width: 2.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="105.97" y0="282.6" x1="117.57">-eq</span><span style="x0: 117.57; x1: 120.89; y0: 286.64; y1: 293.29; width: 3.33; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="117.57" y0="286.64" x1="124.08">&#8211;1</span><span style="x0: 124.08; x1: 126.36; y0: 282.6; y1: 292.1; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="124.08" y0="282.6" x1="304.75">.

However, some mitigation measures were suggested to not compete with other land uses, while also having multiple co-benefits, including adaptation capacity and potential synergies with some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As in AR5, there was large uncertainty surrounding mitigation within AFOLU, in part because current carbon stocks and fluxes are unclear and subject to temporal variability. Additionally, the non-additive nature of individual measures that are often inter-linked and the highly context specific applicability of measures, causes further uncertainty. Many AFOLU measures were considered well-established and some achievable at low to moderate cost, yet contrasting economic drivers, insufficient policy, lack of incentivisation and institutional support to stimulate implementation among the many stakeholders involved, in regionally diverse contexts, was recognised as hampering realisation of potential.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.26" top="210.63"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 321.03; y0: 210.63; y1: 220.13; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="210.63" x1="563.26">None the less, the importance of mitigation within AFOLU was highlighted in all IPCC reports, with modelled scenarios demonstrating the considerable potential role and land-based mitigation forming an important component of pledged mitigation in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. The sector was identified as the only one in which large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) may currently and at short term be possible (e.g.,&#160;through afforestation/reforestation or soil organic carbon management). This CDR component was deemed crucial to limit climate change and its impacts, which would otherwise lead to enhanced release of carbon from land. However, the SRCCL emphasised that mitigation cannot be pursued in isolation. The need for integrated response options, that mitigate and adapt to climate change, but also deal with land degradation and desertification, while enhancing food and fibre </span></div></body></html>
