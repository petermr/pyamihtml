The concept was explored within the SRCCL (SRCCL (Mbow et al. 2019),\nSection 5.6.4.4 and Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 5). SI is context specific and dynamic, with no universally prescribed methodology\n(HLPE 2019). Equal importance is given to enhancing sustainability as to achieving agricultural intensification. The former aspect is\noften challenging to realise, measure and maintain.</td>

      <td>indicating that agricultural intensification, as judged by production per unit of land (Petersen and Snapp 2015; OECD and FAO 2019) has\ntaken place. However, changes in agricultural land use and degradation of natural resources (UNEP 2019; IPBES 2019b) suggests that\nnot all of this intensification is sustainable. Although agricultural intensification has led to less GHG emissions compared to a scenario\nwhere that intensification had not taken place (Burney et al. 2010), absolute agriculture related emissions have continued to increase\n(Section 7.2). Active pursuit of SI was found to be expanding, with implementation on an increasing area, notably in developing\ncountries (Pretty et al. 2018), yet regional agricultural area expansion at the expense of native habitat also continues in such regions\n(Section 7.3). Although there are specific examples of SI (Box 7.13) global progress in achieving SI is acknowledged as slow (Cassman\nand Grassini 2020) with potentially multiple, context specific geophysical and socio-economic barriers to implementation (Firbank\net al. 2018; da Silva et al. 2021).</td>

For example, AR5 highlighted a growing emphasis on reducing GHG emissions per unit of product\nvia increasing production efficiency (Smith et al. 2014), but reductions in absolute GHG emissions will only occur when production\nefficiency increases at a greater rate than the rate at which production increases (Clark et al. 2005).</td>

SI may warrant whole system redesign or land reallocation (Garnett et al. 2013;\nPretty et al. 2018). Accordingly, there is high agreement concerning the need to consider multiple environmental and social outcomes</td>
