California may implement regulations on methane emissions from cattle, however, regulations if approved, will not go into effect until 2024. Institutional and trade-related barriers (e.g.,&#160;leakage) likely will limit widespread implementation of taxes on emissions in the food sector globally. Many countries exempt purchases of fuels used in agricultural or fishery production from fuel or carbon taxes, thus lowering the effective tax rate imposed on those sectors (OECD 2021a). Furthermore, bioenergy, produced from agricultural products, agricultural waste, and wood is often exempted from explicit carbon taxes. Colombia recently implemented a&#160;carbon tax on liquid fuels but allowed domestically produced forestry credits to offset the tax.
