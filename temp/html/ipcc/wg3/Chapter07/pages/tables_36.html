Climate change is putting a large pressure on mono species and high stocked areas of Norway spruce in Central Europe\n(Hl&#225;sny et al. 2021; Senf and Seidl 2021) with estimates of mortality reaching 200 million m3, biodiversity under pressure, the\nMediterranean area showing a weak sector and harvesting pressure in the Baltics and north reaching maxima achievable. A European\nstrategy for unlocking the EU&#8217;s forests and forest sector potential was needed at the time of developing the LULUCF regulation and\nwas based on the concept of &#8216;climate-smart forestry&#8217; (CSF) (Nabuurs et al. 2017; Verkerk et al. 2020).</td>

      <td>of measures can be applied to provide positive incentives for more firmly integrating climate objectives into the forest and forest\nsector framework. CSF is more than just storing carbon in forest ecosystems; it builds upon three main objectives; (i) reducing and/\nor removing GHG emissions; (ii) adapting and building diverse forests for forest resilience to climate change; and (iii) sustainably\nincreasing forest productivity and incomes. These three CSF objectives can be achieved by tailoring policy measures and actions to\nregional circumstances in member states&#8217; forest sectors.</td>
