Since the earlier assessment reports, new studies have emerged to provide new insights on the effect of these issues on the credibility of forest and agricultural mitigation. This assessment also provides additional context not considered in earlier assessments.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.05" top="198.61"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.24; y0: 198.61; y1: 208.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="198.61" x1="299.05">Typically, carbon registries will require that project developers show additionality by illustrating that the project is not undertaken as a&#160;result of a&#160;legal requirement, and that the project achieves carbon reductions above and beyond a&#160;business as usual. The protocols developed by the California Air Resources Board to ensure permanence and additionality are strong standards and may even limit participation (e.g.,&#160;Ruseva et al. 2017). The business as usual is defined as past management actions by the same entity that can be verified. Additionality can thus be observed in the future as a&#160;difference from historical actions. This approach has been used by several countries in their UNFCCC Biennial Update reports to establish reductions in carbon emissions from avoided deforestation (e.g.,&#160;Brazil and Indonesia).</span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.6" top="342.63"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 315.0; y0: 342.63; y1: 352.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="342.63" x1="557.6">However, alternative statistical approaches have been deployed in the literature to assess additionality with a&#160;quasi-experimental method that rely on developing a&#160;counterfactual (e.g.,&#160;Andam et al. 2008; Blackman 2015; Sills et al. 2015; Fortmann et al. 2017; Roopsind et al. 2019). In several studies, additionality in avoided deforestation was established after the project had been developed by comparing land-use change in treated plots where the policy or programme was in effect with land-use change in similar untreated plot. Alternatively, synthetic matching statistically compares trends in a&#160;treated region (i.e., a&#160;region with a&#160;policy) to trends in a&#160;region without the policy, and has been applied in a&#160;region in Brazil (e.g.,&#160;Sills et al. 2015), and at the country level in Guyana (Roopsind et al. 2019).

In addition to the carbon benefits, these agroforestry systems decrease erosion, provide animal fodder, recharge groundwater, generate nutrition and income benefits and act as safety nets for vulnerable rural households during climate and other shocks (Bayala et al. 2014, 2015; Binam et al. 2015; Sinare and Gordon 2015; Ilstedt et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="97.41" top="594.48"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 69.64; y0: 594.48; y1: 604.48; width: 4.44; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="65.2" y0="594.48" x1="97.41">Lessons</span><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.65; y0: 582.6; y1: 592.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="582.6" x1="543.41">A m&#233;lange of factors contributed to regreening in the Sahel. Increased precipitation, migration, community development, economic volatility and local policy reform have all likely played a&#160;role (Haglund et al. 2011; Sendzimir et al. 2011; Brandt et al. 2019a; Garrity and Bayala 2019); the easing of forestry regulations has been particularly critical in giving farmers greater control over the management and use of trees on their land (Garrity et al. 2010). This policy shift was catalysed by greater regional autonomy resulting from economic decline and coincided with successful pilots and NGO-led experimentation, cash-for-work, and training efforts to support changes in land management (Sendzimir et al. 2011). Participation of farmers in planning and implementation helped align actions with local knowledge and goals as well as market opportunities.</span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.44" top="486.61"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 486.61; y1: 496.11; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="486.61" x1="543.44">Regreening takes place when dormant seed or tree stumps sprout and are cultivated through the technique, called Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR). Without planting new trees, FMNR is presumed to be cheaper than other approaches to restoration, though comparative economic analysis has yet to be conducted (Chomba et al. 2020). Relatively lower investment costs are believed to have contributed to the replication across the landscape. These factors worked together to contribute to a&#160;groundswell of action that affected rights, access, and use of local resources (Tougiani et al. 2009).</span></div><div left="65.2" right="543.42" top="414.62"><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 70.13; y0: 414.62; y1: 424.12; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="65.2" y0="414.62" x1="543.42">Regreening in the Sahel and the consequent transformation of the landscape has resulted from the actions of hundreds of thousands of individuals responding to social and biophysical signals (Hanan 2018).
