Studies arrive at varying mitigation potentials for bioenergy and BECCS due to the large diversity of bioenergy systems, and varying conditions concerning where and how they are deployed (Elshout 2015; Harper et al.2018; Muri 2018; Kalt et al.2019; Brand&#227;o et al. 2019; Buchspies et al. 2020; Cowie et al. 2021; Calvin et al. 2021). Important factors include feedstock type, land management practice, energy conversion efficiency, type of bioenergy product (and possible co-products), emissions intensity of the products being displaced, and the land use/cover prior to bioenergy deployment (Zhu et al. 2017; Staples et al. 2017; Daioglou et al. 2017; Carvalho et al. 2017; Hanssen et al. 2020; Mouratiadou et al. 2020). Studies arrive at contrasting conclusions also when similar bioenergy systems and conditions are analysed, due to different methodologies, assumptions, and parametrization (Harper et al.2018; Kalt et al.2019; Brand&#227;o et al. 2019; Albers et al. 2019; Buchspies et al. 2020; Bessou et al. 2020; Rolls and Forster 2020; Cowie et al. 2021).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.09" top="546.62"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.8; y0: 546.62; y1: 556.12; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="546.62" x1="549.09">Box&#160;7.7, Figure&#160;1 shows emissions associated with biomass supply (residues and crops grown on cropland not needed for food) in 2050, here designated emission-supply curves. The curves are constructed assuming that additional biomass supply consistently comes from the available land/biomass resource that has the lowest GHG emissions, for example, the marginal GHG emissions increase with increasing biomass use for bioenergy. Net negative emissions indicate cases where biomass production increases land carbon stocks.</span></div></body></html>
