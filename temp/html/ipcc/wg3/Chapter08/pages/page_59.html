This section brings together the urban mitigation options described in Section&#160;8.4 and assesses the range of mitigation potentials for different types of cities. There is consensus in the literature that mitigation strategies are most effective when multiple interventions are coupled together. Urban-scale interventions that implement multiple strategies concurrently through policy packages are more effective and have greater emissions savings than when single interventions are implemented separately. This is because a&#160;city-wide strategy can have cascading effects across sectors, that have multiplicative effects on GHG emissions reduction within and outside a&#160;city&#8217;s administrative boundaries. Therefore, city-scale strategies can reduce more emissions than the net sum of individual interventions, particularly if multiple scales of governance are included (Sections&#160;8.4 and 8.5). Furthermore, cities have the ability to implement policy packages across sectors using an urban systems approach, such as through planning, particularly those that affect key infrastructures (Figures&#160;8.15, 8.17 and 8.22).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.74" top="438.63"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 438.63; y1: 448.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="438.63" x1="304.74">The way that cities are laid out and built will shape the entry points for realising systemic transformation across urban form and infrastructure, energy systems, and supply chains.

Below, Figure&#160;8.20 distils the typologies of urban growth across three categories: emerging, rapidly growing, and established. Urban growth is relatively stabilised in established urban areas with mature urban form while newly taking shape in emerging urban areas. In contrast, rapidly growing urban areas experience pronounced changes in outward and/or upward growth. These typologies are not mutually exclusive, and can co-exist within an urban system; cities typically encompass a&#160;spectrum of development, with multiple types of urban form and various typologies (Mahtta et al. 2019).</span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.25" top="594.65"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.43; y0: 594.65; y1: 604.15; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="594.65" x1="563.25">Taken together, urban form (Figure&#160;8.16) and growth typology (Figure&#160;8.20) can act as a&#160;roadmap for cities or sub-city communities looking to identify their urban context and, by extension, the mitigation opportunities with the greatest potential to reduce GHG emissions. Specifically, this considers whether a&#160;city is established with existing and managed infrastructure; rapidly growing with new and actively developing infrastructure; or emerging with large amounts of infrastructure build-up. The long lifespan of urban infrastructure locks in behaviour and committed emissions. Therefore, the sequencing of mitigation strategies is important for determining emissions savings in the short and long term. Hence, different types of cities will have different mitigation pathways, depending upon a&#160;city&#8217;s urban form and state of that city&#8217;s urban development and infrastructure; the policy packages and implementation plan that provide the highest mitigation potential for rapidly growing cities&#160;with new infrastructures will differ from those for established cities  with existing infrastructure.</span></div><div left="56.67" right="350.18" top="113.12"><span style="x0: 56.67; x1: 60.37; y0: 113.12; y1: 121.12; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.67" y0="113.12" x1="350.18">Figure&#160;8.20:&#160;Urban growth typologies define the main patterns of urban development. </span><span style="x0: 350.45; x1: 354.01; y0: 113.12; y1: 121.12; width: 3.55; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="350.45" y0="113.12" x1="563.18">Emerging urban areas are undergoing the buildup of new infrastructure. These are new urban areas that are budding out. Rapidly growing urban areas are undergoing significant changes in either outward and/or upward growth, accompanied by large-scale development of new urban infrastructure. Established urban areas are relatively stable with mature urban form and existing urban infrastructures. Each of these typologies represents different levels of economic development and state of urbanisation. Rapidly growing urban areas that are building up through vertical development are often those with higher levels of economic development. Rapidly growing urban areas that are building outward through horizontal expansion are found at lower levels of economic development and are land intensive. Like with urban form, different areas of a&#160;single city can undergo different growth typologies. Therefore a&#160;city will be comprised of multiple urban growth typologies.
