      <td>In some cases, the scope of these targets extends beyond net-zero emissions from any given sector based on direct emissions (see\nGlossary) and encompass downstream emissions from a consumption-based perspective with 195 targets that are found to represent\neconomy-wide targets. These commitments range from &#8216;carbon neutrality&#8217; (see Glossary) or net-zero GHG emissions targets, which\nentail near elimination of cities&#8217; own direct or electricity-based emissions but could involve some type of carbon offsetting, to more\nstringent net-zero-emissions goals (Data-Driven EnviroLab and NewClimate Institute 2020) (for related definitions, such as &#8216;carbon\nneutrality&#8217;, &#8216;net-zero CO emissions&#8217;, &#8216;net-zero GHG emissions&#8217;, and &#8216;offset&#8217;, see Glossary).\n2</td>
