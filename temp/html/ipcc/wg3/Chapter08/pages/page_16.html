For example, green roofs and facades and other urban greening efforts such as urban agriculture and greening streets can improve microclimatic conditions and enhance thermal comfort, thereby reducing utility and health care costs. The presence of green and blue infrastructure may also increase the economic values of nearby properties (Votsis 2017; Alves et al. 2019) (Section&#160;8.4.4 and Figure&#160;8.18).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.09" top="618.61"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.24; y0: 618.61; y1: 628.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="618.61" x1="299.09">Studies in the UK show that beneficiaries are willing to pay (WTP) an additional fee (up to 2% more in monthly rent) for proximity to green and blue infrastructure, with the WTP varying depending on the size and nature of the green space (Mell et al. 2013, 2016). Urban agriculture can not only reduce household food expenditure, but also provide additional sources of revenue for the city (Ayerakwa 2017; Alves et al. 2019).

Wastewater recycling can minimise the costs associated with the renewal of centralised wastewater treatment plants (Bernstad Saraiva Schott and C&#225;novas 2015; Gharfalkar et al. 2015; Gonzalez-Valencia et al. 2016; Herrero and Vilella 2018; Matsuda et al. 2018; Nisbet et al. 2019).

Additionally, authorities can sell energy generated from wastewater recycling to compensate for the wastewater management costs (Colenbrander et al. 2017; Gondhalekar and Ramsauer 2017). Another measure that contributes to reducing household costs is the promotion of behavioural measures such as dietary changes that can decrease the demand for costly food sources and reduce health care costs through promoting healthy diets (Hoppe et al. 2016) (Sections&#160;8.4.5 and 8.4.6).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.06" top="282.66"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 53.32; y0: 282.66; y1: 292.16; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="282.66" x1="299.06">In addition to cost savings, various measures such as stormwater management and urban greening can enhance social equity and environmental justice. For example, the thermal comfort benefits provided by green and blue infrastructure and passive design measures can address issues related to energy poverty and unaffordability of expensive air conditioning systems for some social groups (Sharma et al. 2018; He et al. 2019). To achieve such benefits, however, the costs of integrating green and blue infrastructure and passive design measures into building design would need to be minimised. Another example is the flood mitigation benefits of stormwater management measures that can reduce impacts on urban poor who often reside in flood-prone and low-lying areas of cities (Adegun 2017; He et al. 2019). Generally, the urban poor are expected to be disproportionately affected by climate change impacts. Carefully designed measures that reduce such disproportionate impacts by involving experts, authorities and citizens would enhance social equity (Pandey et al. 2018; He et al. 2019; Mulligan et al. 2020).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="500.26" top="726.48"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.74; y0: 726.48; y1: 736.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="309.54" y0="726.48" x1="500.26">8.2.3 Coupling Mitigation and Adaptation</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.58" top="702.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.76; y0: 702.6; y1: 712.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="702.6" x1="557.58">There are numerous synergies that come from coupling urban adaptation and mitigation. A&#160;number of studies have developed methods to assess the synergies between mitigation and adaptation strategies, as well as their co-benefits (Solecki et al. 2015; Buonocore et al. 2016; Chang et al. 2017; Helgenberger and J&#228;nicke 2017). Co-benefits occur when implementing mitigation (or adaptation) measures that have positive effects on adaptation (or mitigation) (Sharifi 2021). In contrast, the trade-offs emerge when measures aimed at improving mitigation (adaptation) undermine the ability to pursue adaptation (mitigation) targets (Sharifi 2020). The magnitude of such co-benefits and trade-offs may vary depending on various factors. A&#160;systematic review of over 50 climate change articles provides evidence that mitigation can contribute to resilience&#160;&#8211; especially to temperature changes and flooding&#160;&#8211; with varying magnitudes, depending on factors such as the type of mitigation measure and the scale of implementation (Sharifi 2019).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.58" top="498.63"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 316.93; y0: 498.63; y1: 508.13; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="498.63" x1="557.58">Measures from different sectors that can provide both mitigation and adaptation benefits involve urban planning (Section&#160;8.4.2), buildings (Sections&#160;8.4.3.2 and 8.4.4), energy (Section&#160;8.4.3), green and blue infrastructure (Section&#160;8.4.4), transportation (Section&#160;8.4.2), socio-behavioural aspects (Section&#160;8.4.5), urban governance (Section&#160;8.5), waste (Section&#160;8.4.5.2), and water (Section&#160;8.4.6). In addition to their energy-saving and carbon-sequestration benefits, many measures can also enhance adaptation to climate threats, such as extreme heat, energy shocks, floods, and droughts (Sharifi 2021). Existing evidence is mainly related to urban green infrastructure, urban planning, transportation, and buildings. There has been more emphasis on the potential co-benefits of measures, such as proper levels of density, building energy efficiency, distributed and decentralised energy infrastructure, green roofs and facades, and&#160;public/active transport modes. Renewable-based distributed and decentralised energy systems improve resilience to energy shocks and can enhance adaptation to water stress considering the water-energy nexus. By&#160;further investment on these measures, planners and decision makers can ensure enhancing achievement of mitigation/ adaptation co-benefits at the urban level (Sharifi 2021).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.57" top="246.66"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 315.0; y0: 246.66; y1: 256.16; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="246.66" x1="557.57">As for trade-offs, some mitigation efforts may increase exposure to stressors such as flooding and the urban heat island (UHI) effect (see&#160;Glossary), thereby reducing the adaptive capacity of citizens. For instance, in some contexts, high-density areas that lack adequate provision of green and open spaces may intensify the UHI effect (Pierer and Creutzig 2019; Xu et al. 2019). There are also concerns that some mitigation efforts may diminish adaptive capacity of urban  poor and marginalised groups through increasing costs of urban&#160;services and/or eroding livelihood options. Environmental policies designed to meet mitigation targets through phasing out old vehicles may erode livelihood options of poor households, thereby decreasing their adaptive capacity (Colenbrander et al. 2017). Ambitious mitigation and adaptation plans could benefit private corporate interests resulting in adverse effects on the urban poor (Chu et al. 2018; Mehta et al. 2019).</span></div></body></html>
