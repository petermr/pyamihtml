      <td>This could lead to a trajectory where exotic understory species,\nwhich are often herbaceous, out-compete regenerating trees in\nthe understory layer, alter the soil (Ward et al. 2020), and alter the\nforest canopy (Matthews et al. 2016). A change in New York City&#8217;s\nvegetation structure and composition to a more open vegetation\ntype could reduce the carbon storage by over half (open grassland\n120.1 MgC ha&#8211;1).</td>

      <td>When compared to estimates of carbon storage presented\nin other studies, the components (pools) of the natural area\nforests in New York City store carbon in similar proportions to\nother non-urban forests (see Table 1). This might suggest that in\nother geographies, similar adjacent non-urban forest types may\nstore similar carbon stocks per unit area (medium confidence).\nHowever, despite similarities to non-urban forests, the urban\ncontext can lead to altered forest function and carbon cycling\nthat should be considered. For example, trees growing in urban\nareas have been observed to grow at much higher rates due to\nhigher access to light, nutrients, and increased temperatures\n(Gregg et al. 2003; Reinmann et al. 2020).</td>

      <td>Higher growth rates coupled with the UHI effect have also\nbeen suggested to yield greater evaporative cooling by urban\ncanopies relative to rural forests (Winbourne et al. 2020). Based\non estimates in New York City, it is likely that the majority of\ntree biomass, and carbon in trees in cities, could be found in\nurban natural area forest patches (medium agreement, limited\nevidence). More research is needed to map urban natural areas,\nassess vegetation, and differentiate tree canopy types (natural\nversus non-natural) at fine scales within many cities and\ngeographies. Accurate maps, as well as greater understanding of\ndefinitions of urban canopies and vegetation, could lead to better\naccounts for carbon stocks and the many other unique benefits\nthey provide (Raciti et al. 2012; Pregitzer et al. 2019a).</td>

      <td>Despite this potential, natural areas are inherently a minority land-\nuse type in cities and should be viewed along with other types\nof urban tree canopy that occur in more designed environments\nthat might out-perform natural areas in other ecosystem services.\nThe mosaic of vegetation characteristics and growing conditions\nwill yield different ecosystem services across cities (Pataki et al.\n2011) and should be an important consideration in planning,\nmanagement, and policy in the future.</td>
