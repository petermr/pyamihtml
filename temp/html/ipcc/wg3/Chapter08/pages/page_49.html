Building standards and mandates could work towards making these options required or more readily available and accessible. Residential appliance use, water heating, and thermostat settings can be influenced by feedback on energy use, particularly when paired with real-time feedback and/or instructions on how to reduce energy use (Kastner and Stern 2015; Stern et al. 2016; Wynes et al. 2018; Tiefenbeck et al. 2019). The energy-saving potentials of changing occupant behaviour can range between 10% and 25% for residential buildings, and between 5% and 30% for commercial buildings (Zhang et al. 2018). Households are more likely to invest in energy-related home technologies if they believe it financially benefits (rather than disadvantages) them, increases comfort, or will benefit the natural environment (Kastner and Stern 2015). Social influences and availability of funding for household energy measures also support behaviour change (Kastner and Stern 2015).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="258.58" top="522.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 522.48; y1: 532.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="522.48" x1="258.58">8.4.5.1 Increasing Locational and Mobility Options</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.77" top="498.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 498.6; y1: 508.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="498.6" x1="304.77">Spatial planning, urban form, and infrastructure can be utilised to deliberately increase both locational and mobility options for socio-behavioural change in support of urban mitigation.

It holds promise for targeting and obtaining greater reductions in GHG emissions in household travel by providing access through walking, biking, and public transit. Accessibility as a&#160;criterion for urban form has been embedded in neighbourhood form models since at least the last century and in more recent decades in the &#8216;urban village&#8217; concept of the New Urbanism (Duany and Plater-Zyberck 1991) and TODs (Calthorpe 1993). However, accessibility did not gain much traction in urban planning and transportation until the last decade. The experience of cities and metropolitan areas with the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a&#160;further resurgence in interest and importance (Handy 2020; Hu et al. 2020), and it is becoming a&#160;criterion at the core of the concept of the 15/20-minute city (Moreno et al. 2021; Pozoukidou and Chatziyiannaki 2021). Initially, neighbourhoods have been designed to provide quality, reliable services within 15&#160;or 20 minutes of active transport (i.e.,&#160;walking or cycling), as well as a&#160;variety of housing options and open space (Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability 2012; Pozoukidou and Chatziyiannaki 2021; State Government of Victoria 2021). Community life circles strategy for urban areas has also emphasised walking access and health (Weng et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2021). The growing popularity of the 15/20-minute city movement has significant potential for reducing VMT/VKT and associated GHG emissions.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="516.87" top="726.48"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.01; y0: 726.48; y1: 736.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="726.48" x1="516.87">8.4.5.2 Avoiding, Minimising, and Recycling Waste</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.27" top="702.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 702.6; y1: 712.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="702.6" x1="563.27">The waste sector is a&#160;significant source of GHG emissions, particularly CH</span><span style="x0: 325.77; x1: 328.96; y0: 689.41; y1: 696.06; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="325.77" y0="689.41" x1="328.96">4</span><span style="x0: 331.05; x1: 333.69; y0: 690.6; y1: 700.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="331.05" y0="690.6" x1="563.27">(Gonzalez-Valencia et al. 2016; Nisbet et al. 2019). Currently, the sector remains the largest contributor to urban emissions after the energy sector, even in low-carbon cities (Lu and Li 2019). Since waste management systems are usually under the control of municipal authorities, they are a&#160;prime target for city-level mitigation efforts with co-benefits (EC 2015, 2020; Gharfalkar et al. 2015; Herrero and Vilella 2018; Zaman and Ahsan 2019). Despite general agreement on mitigation impacts, quantification remains challenging due to differing assumptions for system boundaries and challenges related to measuring avoided waste (Zaman and Lehmann 2013; Bernstad Saraiva Schott and C&#225;novas 2015; Matsuda et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.29" top="546.62"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 546.62; y1: 556.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="546.62" x1="563.29">The implementation of the waste hierarchy from waste prevention onward, as well as the effectiveness of waste separation at source, involves socio-behavioural options in the context of urban infrastructure (Sun et al. 2018a; Hunter et al. 2019). Managing and treating waste as close to the point of generation as possible, including distributed waste treatment facilities, can minimise transport-related emissions, congestion, and air pollution. Home composting and compact urban form can also reduce waste transport emissions (Oliveira et al. 2017). Decentralised waste management can reinforce source-separation behaviour since the resulting benefits can be more visible (Eisted et al. 2009; Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata 2012; Linzner and Lange 2013). Public acceptance for waste management is greatest when system costs for citizens are reduced, there is greater awareness of primary waste separation at source, and there are positive behavioural spill-overs across environmental policies (Milutinovi&#263; et al. 2016; Boyer and Ramaswami 2017; D&#237;az-Villavicencio et al. 2017; Slorach et al. 2020). In addition to the choice of technology, the costs of waste management options depend on the awareness of system users that can represent time-dependent costs (Khan et al. 2016; Chifari et al. 2017; Ranieri et al. 2018; Tomi&#263; and Schneider 2020). Waste management systems and the inclusion of materials from multiple urban sectors for alternative by-products can increase scalability (Eriksson et al. 2015; Boyer and Ramaswami 2017; D&#8217;Adamo et al. 2021). As a&#160;broader concept, circular economy approaches can contribute to managing waste (Box&#160;12.8) with varying emissions impacts (Section&#160;5.3.4).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="222.66"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 222.66; y1: 232.16; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="222.66" x1="563.28">The generation and composition of waste varies considerably from region to region and city to city. So do the levels of institutional management, infrastructure, and (informal) work in waste disposal activities. Depending on context, policy priorities are directed towards reducing waste generation and transforming waste to energy or other products in a&#160;circular economy (Diaz 2017; Ezeudu and Ezeudu 2019; Joshi et al. 2019; Calder&#243;n M&#225;rquez and Rutkowski 2020; Fatimah et al. 2020). Similarly, waste generation, waste collection coverage, recycling, and composting rates, as well as the means of waste disposal and treatment, differ widely, including the logistics of urban waste management systems. Multiple factors influence waste generation, and regions with similar urbanisation rates can generate different levels of waste per capita (Kaza et al. 2018).</span></div></body></html>
