In moving forward with the research agenda on cities and climate change science, transformation of urban systems will be critical; however, understanding this transformation and how best to assess mitigation action remain key knowledge gaps (Butcher-Gollach 2018; Pathak and Mahadevia 2018; Rigolon et al. 2018; Anguelovski et al. 2019; Buyana et al. 2019; Trundle 2020; Azunre et al. 2021).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.77" top="462.62"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 462.62; y1: 472.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="462.62" x1="304.77">There is a&#160;key knowledge gap in respect to the potential of the informal sector in developing country cities.

The impact of COVID-19 on urban&#160;activity and urban GHG emissions may offer insights into urban emissions and their behavioural drivers and may include structural shifts in emissions that last into the future. The science is unclear as to the links between urban characteristics and COVID-19, and involves multiple aspects. For example, some research shows higher COVID-19 infection rates with city size (e.g.,&#160;Dalziel et al. 2018; Stier et al. 2021), as well as challenges to epidemic preparedness due to high population </span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.29" top="726.62"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.79; y0: 726.62; y1: 736.12; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="726.62" x1="563.29">density and high volume of public transportation (Layne et al. 2020; Lee et al. 2020).

For example, long-term exposure to air pollution has been found to exacerbate the impacts of COVID-19 infections (Wu et al. 2020b), while urban areas with cleaner air from clean energy and greenspace, can provide advantages.</span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.25" top="534.64"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.43; y0: 534.64; y1: 544.14; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="534.64" x1="563.25">Some studies indicate that socio-economic factors, such as poverty, racial and ethnic disparities, and crowding are more significant than density in COVID-19 spread and associated mortality rate (Borjas 2020; Maroko et al. 2020; Lamb et al. 2021). The evidence for the connection between household crowding and the risk of contagion from infectious diseases is also strong. A&#160;2018 World Health Organization (WHO) systematic review of the effect of household crowding on health concluded that a&#160;majority of studies of the risk of non-tuberculosis infectious diseases, including flu-related illnesses, were associated with household crowding (Shannon et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.28" top="402.66"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.43; y0: 402.66; y1: 412.16; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="402.66" x1="563.28">Though preliminary, some studies suggest that urban areas saw larger overall declines in emissions because of lower commuter activity and associated emissions.
