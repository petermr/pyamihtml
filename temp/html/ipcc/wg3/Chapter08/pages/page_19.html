Tax and fiscal incentives for businesses and individuals can help support city-wide behaviour change towards low-carbon and risk-reducing choices. Change can start where governments have most control&#160;&#8211; often in public sector institutions and investment&#160;&#8211; but the challenge ahead requires partnership with private sector and community actors acting at scale and with accountability.

Conditions of complexity, uncertainty, and constrained resources require innovative solutions that are both adaptive and anticipatory. Complex interactions among multiple agents in times of uncertainty makes decision-making about social, economic, governance, and infrastructure choices challenging and can lead decision-makers to postpone action. This is the case for those balancing household budgets, residential investment portfolios, and city-wide policy responsibilities. Living with climate change requires changes to business-as-usual design-making. Co-design and collaboration with communities through iterative policy experimentation can point the way towards climate-resilient development pathways (Ata&#246;v and Peker 2021). Key to successful learning is transparency in policymaking, inclusive policy processes, and robust local modelling, monitoring, and evaluation, which are not yet widely undertaken (Sanchez Rodriguez et al. 2018; Ford et al. 2019).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.15" top="126.65"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 126.65; y1: 136.15; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="126.65" x1="549.15">The diversity of cities&#8217; experiences of climate mitigation and adaptation strategies brings an advantage for those city governments and other actors willing to &#8216;learn together&#8217; (</span><span style="x0: 212.24; x1: 214.34; y0: 114.65; y1: 124.15; width: 2.11; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="212.24" y0="114.65" x1="270.93">limited evidence</span><span style="x0: 270.93; x1: 273.21; y0: 114.65; y1: 124.15; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="270.93" y0="114.65" x1="275.49">, </span><span style="x0: 275.46; x1: 280.04; y0: 114.65; y1: 124.15; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="275.46" y0="114.65" x1="332.43">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 332.43; x1: 335.07; y0: 114.65; y1: 124.15; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="332.43" y0="114.65" x1="549.09">) (Bellinson and Chu 2019; Haupt and Coppola 2019).
