Varied historical legacies of transportation and the built environment, which can be utilised to develop more sustainable cities (Newman et al. 2016, 2017), are often not taken into account directly. Metropolitan policies and spatial planning, as evident in&#160;Copenhagen&#8217;s Finger Plan, as well as strategic spatial planning&#160;in Stockholm and Seoul, have been major tools to restructure urban regions and energy patterns (Sung and Choi 2017). Road prices and congestion charges can provide the conditions for urban inhabitants to shift mobility demands and reduce vehicle use (Section&#160;5.6.2). Surprisingly, even cities with higher population densities and a&#160;greater range of land uses can show declines in these important attributes, which can lead to emissions increases, such as found in a&#160;study of 323 East and South East Asian cities (Chen et al. 2020c).

When combined with advances in transport technology, this share increases to 64&#8211;70% in 2050 based on compact urban form scenarios for 1727 municipalities (Kii 2020).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.09" top="390.61"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.48; y0: 390.61; y1: 400.11; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="390.61" x1="299.09">As a&#160;reaffirmation of AR5, population density reduces emissions per capita in the transport, building, and energy sectors (Baur et al. 2015; Gudipudi et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2017; Yi et al. 2017) (see also Sections&#160;8.3.1 and 8.3.4 on past trends and forecasts of urban population density and land expansion). Urban compactness tends to reduce emissions per capita in the transport sector, especially for commuting (Matsuhashi and Ariga 2016; Lee and Lim 2018; Lee and Lee 2020). The relative accessibility of neighbourhoods to the rest of the region, in addition to the density of individual neighbourhoods, is important (Ewing et al. 2018). Creating higher residential and employment densities, developing smaller block sizes, and increasing housing opportunities in an employment area can significantly reduce household car ownership and car driving, and increase the share of transit, walk, and bicycle commuting (Ding et al. 2018). In addition to population density, land-use mix, rail transit accessibility, and street design reduce emissions from transport (Dou et al. 2016; Cao and Yang 2017; Choi 2018). The impact of population density and urban compactness on emissions per capita in the household or energy sector is also associated with socioeconomic characteristics or lifestyle preferences (Baiocchi et al. 2015; Miao 2017). Changes in the attributes of urban form and spatial structure have influences on overall energy demand across spatial scales, particularly street, block, neighbourhood, and city scales, as well as across the building (housing) and transport (mobility) sectors (Silva et al. 2017). Understanding the existing trade-offs (or synergetic links) between urban form variables across major emissions source sectors, and how they impact the size of energy flows within the urban system, is key to prioritising action for energy-efficient spatial planning strategies, which are likely to vary across urban areas.</span></div><div left="309.54" right="543.97" top="726.48"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.34; y0: 726.48; y1: 736.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="726.48" x1="543.97">8.4.2.3 Urban Form, Growth, and Sustainable Development</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.61" top="702.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.76; y0: 702.6; y1: 712.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="702.6" x1="557.61">Spatial planning for compact urban form is a&#160;system-wide intervention (Sethi et al. 2020) and has potential to be combined with sustainable development objectives while pursuing climate mitigation for urban systems (Gro&#223;e et al. 2016; Cheshmehzangi and Butters 2017; Facchini et al. 2017; Lwasa 2017; Stokes and Seto 2019). Compact urban form can enable positive impacts on employment and green growth given that the local economy is decoupled from GHG emissions and related parameters while the concentration of people and activity can increase productivity based on both proximity and efficiency (Lee and Erickson 2017; Salat et al. 2017; Gao and Newman 2018; Han et al. 2018; Li and Liu 2018; Lall et al. 2021).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.57" top="558.62"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.11; y0: 558.62; y1: 568.12; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="558.62" x1="557.57">Public acceptance can have a&#160;positive impact on integrated spatial planning especially when there is a&#160;process of co-design (Grandin et al. 2018; Webb et al. 2018). The quality of spatial planning can also increase co-benefits for health and well-being, including decisions to balance urban green areas with density (Li et al. 2016; Sorkin 2018; Pierer and Creutzig 2019). The distributional effects of spatial planning can depend on the policy tools that shape the influence of urban densification on affordable housing while evidence for transit-induced gentrification is found to be partial and inconclusive (Chava and Newman 2016; Jagarnath and Thambiran 2018; Padeiro et al. 2019; Debrunner and Hartmann 2020) (Sections&#160;8.2 and 8.4.4).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.6" top="402.64"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.47; y0: 402.64; y1: 412.14; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="402.64" x1="557.6">Reducing GHG emissions across different urban growth typologies (Figure&#160;8.20) depends in part on the ability to integrate opportunities for climate mitigation with co-benefits for health and well-being (Grandin et al. 2018). At the same time, requirements for institutional capacity and governance for cross-sector coordination for integrated urban planning is high given the complex relations between urban mobility, buildings, energy systems, water systems, ecosystem services, other urban sectors, and climate adaptation (Gro&#223;e et al. 2016; Cast&#225;n Broto 2017a; Endo et al. 2017; Geneletti et al. 2017). The capacity for implementing land-use zoning and regulations in a&#160;way that is consistent with supporting spatial planning for compact urban form is not equal across urban areas and depends on different contexts as well as institutional capacities (Bak&#305;r et al. 2018; Deng et al. 2018; Shen et al. 2019).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.59" top="222.66"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.64; y0: 222.66; y1: 232.16; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="222.66" x1="557.59">Currently, integrating spatial planning, urban form, and infrastructure in urban mitigation strategies remains limited in mainstream practices, including in urban areas targeting an emissions reduction of 36&#8211;80% in the next decades (Asarpota and Nadin 2020).
