Countries develop their own definitions of urban, often based on a&#160;combination of population size or density, and other criteria including the percentage of population not employed in agriculture, the availability of electricity, piped water, or other infrastructures, and characteristics of the built environment, such as dwellings and built structures. This chapter assesses urban systems, which includes cities and towns. It uses a&#160;similar framework to Chapter&#160;6&#160;of AR6 WGII, referring to cities and urban settlements as &#8216;concentrated human habitation centres that exist along a&#160;continuum&#8217; (Dodman et al. 2022) (for further definitions of &#8216;urban&#8217;, &#8216;cities&#8217;, &#8216;settlements&#8217; and related terms, see Glossary, and WGII Chapter&#160;6).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="55.06" top="49.59"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 53.71; y0: 49.59; y1: 55.19; width: 2.69; font-size: 5.6; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="51.02" y0="49.59" x1="55.06">4 </span><span style="x0: 65.2; x1: 68.6; y0: 46.19; y1: 54.19; width: 3.41; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="65.2" y0="46.19" x1="555.6">The countries and areas classification in the underlying report for this figure deviates from the standard classification scheme adopted by WGIII as set out in Annex II, Section&#160;1.</span></div><div left="309.54" right="427.23" top="726.48"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.74; y0: 726.48; y1: 736.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="309.54" y0="726.48" x1="427.23">8.1.4 The Urban Century</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.58" top="702.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.76; y0: 702.6; y1: 712.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="702.6" x1="557.58">The 21st century will be the urban century, defined by a&#160;massive increase in global urban populations and a&#160;significant building up of new urban infrastructure stock to accommodate the growing urban population.

As of 2018, approximately 55% of the global population lives in urban areas (about 4.3&#160;billion people) (UN DESA 2019). It is predicted that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. This will mean adding 2.5 billion people to urban areas between 2018 and 2050, with 90% of this increase taking place in Africa and Asia. There is a&#160;strong correlation between the level of urbanisation and the level of national income, with considerable variation and complexity in the relationship between the two (UN DESA 2019). In general, countries with levels of urbanisation of 75% or greater all have high national incomes, whereas countries with low levels of urbanisation under 35% have low national incomes (UN DESA 2019). In general, there is a&#160;clear positive correlation between the level of urbanisation and income levels (Figure&#160;8.1 and Box&#160;8.1).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="84.76" top="98.0"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 54.73; y0: 98.0; y1: 106.0; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0.339]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="51.02" y0="98.0" x1="84.76">Figure&#160;8.1</span><span style="x0: 84.76; x1: 87.67; y0: 101.4; y1: 107.0; width: 2.91; font-size: 5.6; fill: [0.339]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="84.76" y0="101.4" x1="87.67">4</span><span style="x0: 87.67; x1: 89.75; y0: 98.0; y1: 106.0; width: 2.08; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0.339]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="87.67" y0="98.0" x1="342.96">:&#160;Relationship between urbanisation level and gross national income (GNI). </span><span style="x0: 343.25; x1: 346.66; y0: 98.0; y1: 106.0; width: 3.41; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="343.25" y0="98.0" x1="557.24">There is a&#160;positive and strong correlation between the urbanisation level and gross national income.
