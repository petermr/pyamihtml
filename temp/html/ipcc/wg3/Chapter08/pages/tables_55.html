      <td>The extent of realising and implementing these targets with the collective contribution of urban areas to net-zero-emissions scenarios\nwith sufficient timing and pace of emission reductions will require a coordinated integration of sectors, strategies, and innovations\n(Swilling et al. 2018; Hsu et al. 2020c; Sethi et al. 2020; UNEP IRP 2020). In turn, the transformation of urban systems can significantly\nimpact net-zero-emissions trajectories within mitigation pathways. Institutional capacity, governance, financing, and cross-sector\ncoordination is crucial for enabling and accelerating urban actions for rapid decarbonisation.</td>
