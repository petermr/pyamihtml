AR5 WGIII Chapter&#160;12 reported a&#160;range of co-benefits associated with urban climate change mitigation strategies, including public savings, air quality and associated health benefits, and productivity increases in urban centres (Seto et al. 2014). Since AR5, evidence continues to mount on the co-benefits of urban mitigation. Highlighting co-benefits could make a&#160;strong case for driving impactful mitigation action (Bain et al. 2016), especially in developing countries, where development benefits can be the argument for faster implementation (Sethi and Puppim de Oliveira 2018).

Urban areas can work to redirect development pathways towards sustainability while increasing co-benefits for urban inhabitants. Figure&#160;8.4 indicates that mitigation options for urban systems can provide synergistic linkages across a&#160;wide range of SDGs, and some cases where linkages can produce both synergies and trade-offs. While linkages are based on context and the scale of implementation, synergies can be most significant when urban areas pursue integrated approaches where one mitigation option supports the other (Sections&#160;8.4 and 8.6).</span></div><div left="315.22" right="560.98" top="522.64"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.26; y0: 522.64; y1: 532.14; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="522.64" x1="560.98">Figure&#160;8.4 summarises an evaluation of the synergies and/or trade-offs with the SDGs for the mitigation options for urban systems based on Supplementary Material 8.SM.1. The evaluations depend on the specific urban context, with synergies and/or trade-offs being more significant in certain contexts than others. Urban mitigation with a&#160;view of the SDGs can support shifting pathways of urbanisation towards greater sustainability. The feasibility of urban mitigation options is also malleable and can increase with more &#8216;enabling conditions&#8217; (see Glossary), provided, perhaps, through institutional (i.e.,&#160;financial or governmental) support (Section&#160;8.5). Strengthened institutional capacity that supports the coordination of mitigation options can increase linkages with the SDGs and their synergies. For&#160;example, urban land use and spatial planning for walkable and co-located densities, together with electrification of the urban energy system, can hold more benefits for the SDGs than any one of the mitigation options alone (Sections&#160;8.4.2.3, 8.4.3.1 and 8.6).</span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.23" top="318.66"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.61; y0: 318.66; y1: 328.16; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="318.66" x1="563.23">Evidence on the co-benefits of urban mitigation measures for human health has increased significantly since AR5, especially through the use of health impact assessments, where energy savings and cleaner energy supply structures based on measures for urban planning, heating, and transport have reduced CO</span><span style="x0: 468.43; x1: 471.62; y0: 269.41; y1: 276.06; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="468.43" y0="269.41" x1="471.62">2</span><span style="x0: 471.62; x1: 473.9; y0: 270.6; y1: 280.1; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="471.62" y0="270.6" x1="553.57">, nitrogen oxides (NO</span><span style="x0: 553.57; x1: 556.41; y0: 269.41; y1: 276.06; width: 2.83; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="553.57" y0="269.41" x1="556.41">x</span><span style="x0: 556.41; x1: 559.05; y0: 270.6; y1: 280.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="556.41" y0="270.6" x1="563.26">), and coarse particulate matter (PM</span><span style="x0: 440.91; x1: 444.11; y0: 257.41; y1: 264.06; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="440.91" y0="257.41" x1="447.3">10</span><span style="x0: 447.3; x1: 449.94; y0: 258.6; y1: 268.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="447.3" y0="258.6" x1="563.26">) emissions (Diallo et al. 2016).
