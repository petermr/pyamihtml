      <td>Box 8.2, Table 1: A selection of benchmark reference estimates of different carbon pools sampled and the related urban considerations to\ncontextualise the results from New York City (NYC), United States (USA) natural area carbon stocks. The benchmark estimates are intended to provide\na point of reference to help contextualise the calculations for carbon pools in NYC&#8217;s forests. Forest carbon is highly variable and dependent on microclimatic conditions\nsuch as moisture, microbial communities, and nutrient availability, all of which can be impacted by human activity in urban or altered environments. Standard errors\nand 95% confidence intervals can be found in Pregitzer et al. (2021).
