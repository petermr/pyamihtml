In the urban context, this implies using less material by the design of physical infrastructure based on light-weighting and down-sizing, material substitution, prolonged use, as well as enhanced recycling, recovery, remanufacturing, and reuse of materials and related components. For example, light-weight design in residential buildings and passenger vehicles can enable about 20% reductions in lifecycle material-related GHG emissions (UNEP IRP 2020).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="234.66"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 234.66; y1: 244.16; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="234.66" x1="304.75">The context of urban areas as the nexus of both sectors (i.e.,&#160;energy, and urban form and planning) underlines the role of urban planning and policies in contributing to reductions in material-related GHG emissions while enabling housing and mobility services for the benefit of inhabitants. In addition, combining resource efficiency measures with strategic densification can increase the GHG reduction potential and lower resource impacts. While resource efficiency measures are estimated to reduce GHG emissions, land use, water consumption, and metal use impacts from a&#160;lifecycle assessment perspective by 24&#8211;47% over a&#160;baseline, combining resource efficiency with strategic densification can increase this range to about 36&#8211;54% over the baseline for a&#160;sample of 84 urban settlements worldwide (Swilling et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="66.68"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.09; y0: 66.68; y1: 76.18; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="66.68" x1="304.75">Evidence from a&#160;systematic scoping of urban solutions further indicates that the GHG abatement potential of integrating measures </span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.23" top="726.69"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.61; y0: 726.69; y1: 736.19; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="726.69" x1="563.23">across urban sectors is greater than the net sum of individual interventions due to the potential of realising synergies when realised in tandem, such as urban energy infrastructure and renewable energy (Sethi et al. 2020). Similarly, system-wide interventions, such as sustainable urban form, are important for increasing the GHG abatement potential of interventions based on individual sectoral projects (Sethi et al. 2020). Overall, the pursuit of inter-linkages among urban&#160;interventions is important for accelerating GHG reductions in urban areas (Sethi et al. 2020); this is also important for reducing reliance on carbon capture and storage technologies (CCS) at the global scale (Figures&#160;8.15 and 8.21).</span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.25" top="582.7"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 320.32; y0: 582.7; y1: 592.2; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="582.7" x1="563.25">Currently, cross-sectoral integration is one of the main thematic areas of climate policy strategies among the actions that are adopted by signatories to an urban climate and energy network (Hsu et al. 2020c). Although not as prevalent as those for efficiency, municipal administration, and urban planning measures (Hsu et al. 2020c), strategies that are cross-cutting in nature across sectors can provide important emission-saving opportunities for accelerating the pace of climate mitigation in urban areas. Cross-sectoral integration also involves mobilising urban actors to increase innovation in energy services and markets beyond individual energy efficiency actions (Hsu et al. 2020c). Indeed, single-sector versus cross-sector strategies for 637 cities from a&#160;developing country can enable an additional 15&#8211;36% contribution to the national climate mitigation reduction potential (Ramaswami et al. 2017a).

Indeed, since AR5 more research has emerged identifying these actors as vehicles through which to accelerate local-to-global efforts to decarbonise (IPCC 2018a; Hsu et al. 2020b; Salvia et al. 2021; Seto et al. 2021) (Chapter&#160;13, Sections&#160;4.2.3, 14.5.5, 15.6.5 and 16.4.7, and &#8216;subnational actors&#8217; in Glossary).
