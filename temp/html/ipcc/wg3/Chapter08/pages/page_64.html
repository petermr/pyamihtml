Relative decoupling is obtained (Kalmykova et al. 2015) with increasing evidence for turning points in per capita emissions, total emissions, or urban metabolism (Chen et al. 2018b; Shen et al. 2018). The importance of integrating energy and resource efficiency in sustainable and low-carbon city planning (Dienst et al. 2015), structural changes, as well as forms of disruptive social innovation, such as the &#8216;sharing economy&#8217; (see Glossary), is also evident based on analyses for multiple cities, including those that can be used to lower the carbon footprints of urban areas relative to sub-urban areas (Chen et al. 2018a).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.07" top="558.62"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.24; y0: 558.62; y1: 568.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="558.62" x1="299.07">To minimise carbon footprints, new cities can utilise new intelligence functions as well as changes in energy sources and material processes. Core design strategies of a&#160;compact city can be facilitated by data-driven decision-making so that new urban intelligence functions are holistic and proactive rather than reactive (Bibri 2020). In mainstream practices, for example, many cities use environmental impact reviews to identify potentially negative consequences of individual development projects on environmental conditions on a&#160;piecemeal project basis.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.07" top="438.64"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.84; y0: 438.64; y1: 448.14; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="438.64" x1="299.07">New cities can utilise: system-wide analyses of construction materials, or renewable power sources, that minimise ecosystem disruption and energy use, through the use of lifecycle assessments for building types permitted in the new city (Ingrao et al. 2019); urban-scale metabolic impact assessments for neighbourhoods in the city (Pinho and Fernandes 2019); strategic environmental assessments (SEAs) that go beyond the individual project and assess plans for neighbourhoods (Noble and Nwanekezie 2017); or modelling of the type and location of building masses, tree canopies and parks, and temperature (surface conditions) and prevailing winds profiles to reduce the combined effects of climate change and UHI phenomena, thus minimising the need for air conditioning (Matsuo and Tanaka 2019).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.07" top="270.66"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.95; y0: 270.66; y1: 280.16; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="270.66" x1="299.07">Resource-efficient, compact, sustainable, and liveable urban areas can be enabled with an integrated approach across sectors, strategies, and innovations. From a&#160;geophysical perspective, the use of materials with lower lifecycle GHG impacts, including the use of timber in urban infrastructure and the selection of urban development plans with lower material and land demand can lower the emission impacts of existing and future cities (M&#252;ller et al. 2013; Carpio et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2016a; Ramage et al. 2017; Shi et al. 2017a; Stocchero et al. 2017; Bai et al. 2018; Zhan et al. 2018b; Swilling et al. 2018;  Xu et al. 2018b; UNEP IRP 2020) (Figure&#160;8.17). The capacity to implement relevant policy instruments in an integrated and coordinated manner within a&#160;policy mix while leveraging multi-level support as relevant can increase the enabling conditions for urban system transformation (Agyepong and Nhamo 2017; Roppongi et al. 2017). &#160;</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.06" top="78.68"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.24; y0: 78.68; y1: 88.18; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="78.68" x1="299.06">The integration of urban land use and spatial planning, electrification of urban energy systems, renewable energy district heating and cooling networks, urban green and blue infrastructure, and circular </span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.61" top="726.69"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 313.77; y0: 726.69; y1: 736.19; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="726.69" x1="557.61">economy can also have positive impacts on improving air and environmental quality with related co-benefits for health and well-being (Diallo et al. 2016; Nieuwenhuijsen and Khreis 2016; Shakya 2016; Liu et al. 2017; Ramaswami et al. 2017a; Sun et al. 2018b; Tayarani et al. 2018; Park and Sener 2019; Gonz&#225;lez-Garc&#237;a et al. 2021). Low-carbon development options can be implemented in ways that reduce impacts on water use, including water use efficiency, demand management, and water recycling, while increasing water quality (Koop and van Leeuwen 2015; Topi et al. 2016; Drangert and Sharatchandra 2017; Lam et al. 2017, 2018; Vanham et al. 2017; Kim and Chen 2018). The ability to enhance biodiversity while addressing climate change depends on improving urban metabolism and biophilic urbanism towards urban areas that are able to regenerate natural capital (Thomson and Newman 2018; IPBES 2019b).</span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.6" top="546.71"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 313.77; y0: 546.71; y1: 556.21; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="546.71" x1="557.6">There are readily available solutions for low-carbon urban development that can be further supported by new and emerging ones, such as tools for optimising the impact of urban form on energy infrastructure (Hu et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2017b; Xue et al. 2017; Dobler et al. 2018; Egusquiza et al. 2018; Pedro et al. 2018; Soil&#225;n et al. 2018). The costs of low-carbon urban development are manageable, and enhanced with a&#160;portfolio approach for cost-effective, cost-neutral, and reinvestment options with evidence across different urban typologies (Colenbrander et al. 2015, 2017; Gouldson et al. 2015; Nieuwenhuijsen and Khreis 2016; Saujot and Lef&#232;vre 2016; Sudmant et al. 2016; Brozynski and Leibowicz 2018).</span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.57" top="402.73"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 313.41; y0: 402.73; y1: 412.23; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="402.73" x1="557.57">Low-carbon urban development that triggers economic decoupling can have a&#160;positive impact on employment and local competitiveness (Kalmykova et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2018b; Garc&#237;a-Gusano et al. 2018; Hu et al. 2018; Shen et al. 2018). In addition, sustainable urban transformation can be supported with participatory approaches that provide a&#160;shared understanding of future opportunities and challenges where public acceptance increases with citizen engagement and citizen empowerment as well as an awareness of co-benefits (Blanchet 2015; Bj&#248;rkelund et al. 2016; Flacke and de Boer 2017; Gao et al. 2017; Neuvonen and Ache 2017; Sharp and Salter 2017; Wiktorowicz et al. 2018; Fastenrath and Braun 2018; Gorissen et al. 2018; Herrmann et al. 2018; Moglia et al. 2018). Sustainable and low-carbon urban development that integrates issues of equity, inclusivity, and affordability, while safeguarding urban livelihoods, providing access to basic services, lowering energy bills, addressing energy poverty, and improving public health can also improve the&#160;distributional effects of existing and future urbanisation (Friend et al. 2016; Claude et al. 2017; Colenbrander et al. 2017; Ma et al. 2018; Mr&#243;wczy&#324;ska et al. 2018; Puk&#353;ec et al. 2018; Wiktorowicz et al. 2018) (Section&#160;8.2).</span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.61" top="150.76"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 311.85; y0: 150.76; y1: 160.26; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="150.76" x1="557.61">Information and communications technologies can play an important role for integrating mitigation options at the urban systems level for achieving zero-carbon cities. Planning for decarbonisation at the urban systems level involves integrated considerations of the interaction among sectors, including synergies and trade-offs among households, businesses, transport, land use, and lifestyles. The utilisation of big data, artificial intelligence and internet of things (IoT) technologies can be used to plan, evaluate and integrate rapidly progressing transport and building technologies, such as </span></div></body></html>
