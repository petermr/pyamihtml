That each city is comprised of different and multiple urban growth typologies suggests the need for differentiated mitigation strategies for different parts of a&#160;single city (Section&#160;8.6 and Figure&#160;8.21). Recent research shows that the relative combination of outward versus upward growth is a&#160;reflection of its economic and urban development (Lall et al. 2021). That is, how a&#160;city grows&#160;&#8211; whether upward or outward&#160;&#8211; is a&#160;function of its economic development level.

The study also found that cities within a&#160;geographic region exhibit remarkably similar patterns of urban growth. Some studies have found a&#160;mix of urban forms emerging around the world; an analysis of 194 cities identified an overall trend (from 1990 to 2015) toward urban forms that are a&#160;mixture of fragmented and compact (Lemoine-Rodriguez et al. 2020). The exception to this trend is a&#160;group of large cities in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States that are still predominantly fragmented. The same study also identified small to medium-sized cities as the most dynamic in terms of their expansion and change in their forms.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.07" top="426.64"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.48; y0: 426.64; y1: 436.14; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="426.64" x1="299.07">A third trend in is urban land growth taking place on agricultural land, carbon stocks, and other land uses (see &#8216;carbon stock&#8217; and &#8216;AFOLU&#8217;&#160;&#8211; agriculture, forestry, and other land uses&#160;&#8211; in Glossary).

This percentage increased to about 70% for global urban expansion that occurred between 1992 and 2015, followed by grasslands (about 12%) and forests (about 9%) (Liu et al. 2020a). In terms of percent of total urban land expansion, the largest conversion of agricultural lands to urban land uses from 1970 to 2010 took place in the Eastern Asia, and South-East Asia and Pacific regions; the largest proportional losses of natural land cover were reported for the North America and Australia, Japan and New Zealand regions (G&#252;neralp et al. 2020). At a&#160;sub-regional level, agricultural land constituted the largest proportion of land converted to urban areas in China, India, Europe, Southeast Asian countries and the central United States between 1995 and 2015; in the eastern United States, most new urban land was converted from forests (Liu et al. 2020a). Urban expansion through 2040 may lead to the loss of almost 65 Mt of crop production&#160;&#8211; a scenario that underscores the ongoing relationship between urbanisation and AFOLU (van Vliet et al. 2017) (Chapter&#160;7).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="206.87" top="150.48"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.22; y0: 150.48; y1: 160.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="51.02" y0="150.48" x1="206.87">8.3.2 Informal Urban Settlements</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.05" top="126.6"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.48; y0: 126.6; y1: 136.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="126.6" x1="299.05">About 880 million people currently live in informal settlements&#160;&#8211; defined as unplanned areas operating outside of legal and regulatory systems, where residents have no legal claim over their property and have inadequate basic services and infrastructure (United Nations 2018).

There are several key reasons for their potential to mitigate GHG emissions. First, informal urban areas may not require large investments in retrofitting as they have developed with minimal investment in large-scale infrastructure. Second, these areas exhibit flexibility of development and can potentially be transformed into an urban form that supports low- or carbon-neutral infrastructure for transportation, energy use in residential buildings, and other sectors (Baurzhan and Jenkins 2016; Henneman et al. 2016; Byrne et al. 2017; Oyewo et al. 2019).</span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.58" top="606.63"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 311.85; y0: 606.63; y1: 616.13; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="606.63" x1="557.58">Informal urban areas can avoid the conventional trajectory of urban development by utilising large-scale strategies, such as micro-scale technologies, modal shifts towards compact, walkable urban form, as well as decentralised or meso-scale utilities of water, sanitation, and service centres&#160;&#8211; thereby mitigating emissions associated with transport and treating wastes (Tongwane et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2018). Some specific mitigation options include spatial adjustments for walkability of neighbourhoods, low-energy-intensive mobility, low-energy-intensive residential areas, low-carbon energy sources at city scale, off-grid utilities, and electrification and enhancement of the urban ecology&#160;&#8211; all of which have multiple potential benefits (Colenbrander et al. 2017; Fang et al. 2017; Laramee et al. 2018; van der Zwaan et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2018; Silveti and Andersson 2019). Some of the co-benefits of the various mitigation options include more job opportunities and business start-ups, increased incomes, air quality improvement, and enhanced health and well-being (Gebreegziabher et al. 2014; Dagnachew et al. 2018; Keramidas et al. 2018; Adams et al. 2019; Ambole et al. 2019; Boltz et al. 2019; Moncada et al. 2019; Weimann and Oni 2019; Manga et al. 2020) (Section&#160;8.2).</span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.6" top="366.66"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 315.36; y0: 366.66; y1: 376.16; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="366.66" x1="557.6">Non-networked and non-centralised urban services and infrastructure in informal settlements, including sanitation, waste, water, and electricity, serve over 60% of the urban population in developing country cities (Lawhon et al. 2018).
