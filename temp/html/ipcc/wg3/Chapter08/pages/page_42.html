Increased reduction in the energy demands and GHG emissions associated with the manufacture of mineral-based construction materials will be challenging, as these industries have already optimised their production processes. Among the category of primary structural materials, it is estimated that final energy demand for steel production can be reduced by nearly 30% compared to 2010 levels, with 12% efficiency improvement for cement (Lechtenb&#246;hmer et al. 2016).

Additionally, carbon sequestration by cement occurs over the course of the building lifecycle in quantities that would offset only a&#160;fraction of their production stage carbon spike (Xi et al. 2016; Davis et al. 2018). Moreover, there are collateral effects on the carbon cycle related to modern construction and associated resource extraction. The production of cement, asphalt, and glass requires large amounts of sand extracted from beaches, rivers, and seafloors, disturbing aquatic ecosystems and reducing their capacity to absorb atmospheric carbon. The mining of ore can lead to extensive local deforestation and soil degradation (Sonter et al. 2017). Deforestation significantly weakens the converted land as a&#160;carbon sink and in severe cases may even create a&#160;net emissions source.</span></div><div left="51.03" right="299.1" top="342.63"><span style="x0: 51.03; x1: 56.48; y0: 342.63; y1: 352.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.03" y0="342.63" x1="299.1">A broad-based substitution of monolithic engineered timber systems for steel and concrete in mid-rise urban buildings offers the opportunity to transform cityscapes from their current status as net sources of GHG emissions into large-scale, human-made carbon sinks.

The parallel-to-grain strength of mass (engineered) timber is similar to that of reinforced concrete (Ramage et al. 2017). As much as half the weight of a&#160;given volume of wood is carbon, sequestered during forest growth as a&#160;by-product of photosynthesis (Martin et al. 2018). Mass timber is inflammable, but in large sections forms a&#160;self-protective charring layer when exposed to fire that will protect the remaining &#8216;cold wood&#8217; core. This property, formed as massive structural sections, is recognised in the fire safety regulations of building codes in several countries, which allow mid- and high-rise buildings in timber.

Since future urban growth and the construction of timber cities may lead to increased timber demand in regions with low forest cover, it is necessary to systematically analyse timber demand, supply, trade, and potential competition for agricultural land in different regions (Pomponi et al. 2020). The widespread adoption of biomass-based urban construction materials and techniques will demand more robust forest and urban land governance and management policies, as well as internationally standardised carbon accounting methods to properly value and incentivise forest restoration, afforestation, and sustainable silviculture.</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.56" top="378.66"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.94; y0: 378.66; y1: 388.16; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="378.66" x1="557.56">Expansion of agroforestry practices may help to reduce land-use conflicts between forestry and agriculture. Harvesting pressures on forests can be reduced through the reuse and recycling of wooden components from dismantled timber buildings. Potential synergies between the carbon sequestration capacity of forests and the associated carbon storage capacity of dense mid-rise cities built from engineered timber offer the opportunity to construct carbon sinks deployed at the scale of landscapes, sinks that are at least as durable as other buildings (Churkina et al. 2020).
