The largest cities around the world are becoming even larger, and there is a&#160;growing divergence in economic power between megacities and other large cities (Kourtit et al. 2015; Hoornweg and Pope 2017; Zhao et al. 2017b). Moreover, there is evidence that the largest city in each country has an increasing share of the national population and economy.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.08" top="150.62"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.07; y0: 150.62; y1: 160.12; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="150.62" x1="299.08">Fifth, population declines have been observed for cities and towns across the world, including in Poland, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Germany, and Ukraine. The majority of cities that have experienced population declines are concentrated in Europe. Multiple factors contribute to the decline in cities, including declining industries and the economy, declining fertility, and outmigration to larger cities. Shrinking urban populations could offer retrofitting opportunities (UNEP 2019) and increasing greenspaces (Jarzebski </span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.6" top="282.63"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 313.77; y0: 282.63; y1: 292.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="282.63" x1="557.6">et al. 2021), but the challenges for these cities differ in scope and magnitude from rapidly expanding cities.</span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.62" top="246.63"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 313.77; y0: 246.63; y1: 256.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="246.63" x1="557.62">Sixth, urbanisation in many emerging economies is characterised by informality and an informal economy (Brown and McGranahan 2016). The urban informal economy includes a&#160;wide array of activities, including but not limited to street vending, home-based enterprises, unreported income from self-employment, informal commerce, domestic service, waste-picking, and urban agriculture. The urban informal economy is large and growing. Globally, about 44% of the urban economy is informal, although there is much variation between countries and regions (ILO 2018). Emerging and developing economies have the highest percentage of the urban informal economy, with Africa (76%) and the Arab States (64%) with the largest proportion (ILO 2018). Urban informality also extends to planning, governance and institutions (Roy 2009; EU 2016; Lamson-Hall et al. 2019). Given its prevalence, it is important for urban climate change mitigation strategies to account for informality, especially in emerging and developing countries (Section&#160;8.3.2).</span></div></body></html>
