Social interventions can also support or\nbe led by ambitions to reach the SDGs (Archer 2016). Climate-resilient development invites planners to develop interventions and\nmonitor the effectiveness of outcomes beyond individual projects and across wider remits that consider sustainable development.\nCurbing the emission impacts of urban activities to reach net-zero emissions in the next decades, while improving the resilience of\nurban areas, necessitates an integrated response now.</td>

There are many examples of &#8216;ready-to-use&#8217; policy tools, technologies, and practical interventions\nfor policymakers seeking to act on adaptation and mitigation (Bisaro and Hinkel 2018; Keenan et al. 2019; Chirambo 2021) (see\nWGIII Section 8.5.4). Tax and fiscal incentives for businesses and individuals can help support city-wide behaviour change towards\nlow-carbon and risk-reducing choices. Change can start where governments have most control &#8211; often in public sector institutions\nand investment &#8211; but the challenge ahead requires partnership with private sector and community actors acting at scale and with\naccountability. Urban climate governance and finance needs to address urban inequalities at the forefront if the urban opportunity is\nto realise the ambition of the SDGs.</td>

In the long run, this is also more likely to carry public\nsupport, even if some experiments and investments do not deliver the intended social benefits.

      <td>In recent years, about USD384 billion of climate finance has been invested in urban areas per year. This remains at about 10% of the\nannual climate finance that would be necessary for low-carbon and resilient urban development at a global scale (Negreiros et al.\n2021). Rapid deployment of funds to stimulate economies in the recovery from COVID-19 has highlighted the pitfalls of funding\nexpansion ahead of policy innovation and capacity building. The result can be an intensification of existing carbon-intensive urban\nforms &#8211; exactly the kinds of &#8216;carbon lock-in&#8217; (see WGIII Glossary and WGIII Section 8.4.1) that have contributed to risk creation and its\nconcentration amongst those with little public voice or economic power.</td>

      <td>Iterative and experimental approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation decision-making grounded in data and co-generated in\npartnership with communities can advance low-carbon climate resilience (medium evidence, high confidence) (Culwick et al. 2019;\nCaldarice et al. 2021; van der Heijden and Hong 2021). Conditions of complexity, uncertainty, and constrained resources require\ninnovative solutions that are both adaptive and anticipatory. Complex interactions among multiple agents in times of uncertainty\nmakes decision-making about social, economic, governance, and infrastructure choices challenging and can lead decision-makers\nto postpone action. This is the case for those balancing household budgets, residential investment portfolios, and city-wide policy\nresponsibilities. Living with climate change requires changes to business-as-usual design-making. Co-design and collaboration with\ncommunities through iterative policy experimentation can point the way towards climate-resilient development pathways (Ata&#246;v\nand Peker 2021). Key to successful learning is transparency in policymaking, inclusive policy processes, and robust local modelling,\nmonitoring, and evaluation, which are not yet widely undertaken (Sanchez Rodriguez et al. 2018; Ford et al. 2019).</td>

While\ncontexts are varied, policy options are often similar enough for the sharing of experiments and policy champions. Sharing expertise\ncan build on existing regional and global networks, many of which have already placed knowledge, learning, and capacity building\nat the centre of their agendas. Learning from innovative forms of governance and financial investment, as well as strengthening\nco-production of policy through inclusive access to knowledge and resources, can help address mismatches in local capacities and\nstrengthen wider SDGs and COVID-19 recovery agendas (limited evidence, medium agreement).
