      <td>As a growing megacity in the Global South, Shanghai represents the challenge of becoming low carbon despite its economic growth\nand population size (Chen et al. 2017). Shanghai was designated as one of the pilot low-carbon cities by the central government.\nThe city utilised a coordination mechanism for joining fragmented policymaking across the city&#8217;s economy, energy, and environment.\nThe coordination mechanism was supported by a direct fund that enabled implementation of cross-sector policies beyond a single-\nsector focus across multiple institutions while increasing capacity for enabling a low-carbon transition for urban sustainability\n(Peng and Bai 2020).</td>

Using a nested governance framework, the central government provided target setting and performance evaluation\nwhile the local government initiated pilot projects for low-carbon development.

This provided a continuum of policy learning for implementing low-carbon policy measures.\nAn earlier policy was a green electricity scheme based on the Jade Electricity Program while the need for greater public awareness was\none aspect requiring further attention in policy design (Baeumler et al. 2012), supporting policy-learning for policies later on. The key\npoint here is that low-carbon policies were built on and learned from earlier policies with similar goals.</td>
