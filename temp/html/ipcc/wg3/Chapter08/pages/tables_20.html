Coupling mitigation and adaptation in an\nintegrated approach offers opportunities to enhance efficiency, increases the coherence of urban climate action, generates cost\nsavings, and provides opportunities to reinvest the savings into new climate action projects to make all urban areas and regions\nmore resilient.</td>

      <td>Local governments play an important role in driving climate action across mitigation and adaptation as managers of assets, regulators,\nmobilisers, and catalysts of action, but few cities are undertaking transformative climate adaptation or mitigation actions (limited\nevidence, medium confidence) (Heikkinen et al. 2019). Local actors are providers of infrastructure and services, regulators of zoning,\nand can be conveners and champions of an integrated approach for mitigation and adaptation at multiple levels (limited evidence, high\nconfidence). New opportunities in governance and finance can enable cities to pool resources together and aggregate interventions\nto innovate ways of mobilising urban climate finance at scale (Colenbrander et al. 2019; Simpson et al. 2019; White and Wahba 2019).\nHowever, research increasingly points towards the difficulties faced during the implementation of climate financing in situ, such as\nthe fragmentation of structures of governance capable of managing large investments effectively (Mohammed et al. 2019) (see WGIII\nSection 8.5 and WGIII Chapter 13).</td>

      <td>Scaling up transformative place-based action for both adaptation and mitigation requires enabling conditions, including land-based\nfinancing, intermediaries, and local partnerships (medium evidence, high agreement) (Chu et al. 2019; Chaudhuri, 2020) supported\nby a new generation of big data approaches. Governance structures that combine actors working at different levels with a different\nmix of tools are effective in addressing challenges related to implementation of integrated action while cross-sectoral coordination\nis necessary (Singh et al. 2020). Joint institutionalisation of mitigation and adaptation in local governance structures can also enable\nintegrated action (G&#246;pfert et al. 2020; Hurlimann et al. 2021). However, the proportion of international finance that reaches local\nrecipients remains low, despite the repeated focus of climate policy on place-based adaptation and mitigation (Manuamorn et al.\n2020). Green financing instruments that enable local climate action without exacerbating current forms of inequality can jointly\naddress mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development. Climate finance that also reaches beyond larger non-state enterprises\n(e.g., small and medium-sized enterprises, local communities, or non-governmental organisations (NGOs)), and is inclusive in\nresponding to the needs of all urban inhabitants (e.g., disabled individuals, or citizens of different races or ethnicities) is essential\nfor inclusive and resilient urban development (Colenbrander et al. 2019; Gabald&#243;n-Estevan et al. 2019; Frenova 2021). Developing\nnetworks that can exert climate action at scale is another priority for climate finance.</td>

      <td>The urban megatrend is an opportunity to transition global society. Enabling urban governance to avert cascading risk and achieve\nlow-carbon, resilient development will involve the co-production of policy and planning, rapid implementation and greater cross-\nsector coordination, and monitoring and evaluation (limited evidence, medium agreement) (Di Giulio et al. 2018; Grafakos et al. 2019).\nNew constellations of responsible actors are required to manage hybrid local-city or cross-city risk management and decarbonisation\ninitiatives (limited evidence, medium agreement). These may increasingly benefit from linkages across more urban and more rural\nspace as recognition of cascading and systemic risk brings recognition of supply chains, remittance flows, and migration trends as\nvectors of risk and resilience. Urban governance will be better prepared in planning, prioritising, and financing the kind of measures\nthat can reduce GHG emissions and improve resilience at scale when they consider a view of cascading risks and carbon lock-ins\nglobally, while also acting locally to address local limitations and capacities, including the needs and priorities of urban citizens\n(Colenbrander et al. 2018a; Rodrigues 2019).</td>
