Peak shaving or shifting takes place among frequent interventions at the urban level (Sethi et al. 2020).

The number of cities that have instituted e-mobility targets that aim for a&#160;certain percentage of EVs sold, in circulation or registered, is increasing (REN21 2021).

The policy mix has included mandates for bus deployment, purchase subsidies, or split ownership of buses and chargers (IEA 2021b) (Chapter&#160;10). Subsidies are often critical to address the often-higher upfront costs of electric devices. In other instances, the uptake of electric induction stoves was increased through government credit and allotment of free electricity (Mart&#237;nez et al. 2017; Gould et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.61" top="270.65"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.47; y0: 270.65; y1: 280.15; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="270.65" x1="557.61">Bringing multiple stakeholders together in local decision-making for smart energy systems requires effort beyond usual levels while multi-actor settings can be increased to enable institutional conditions (Lammers and Hoppe 2019).
