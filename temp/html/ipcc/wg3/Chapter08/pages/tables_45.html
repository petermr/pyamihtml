      <td>The structure, composition, extent, and growing conditions of vegetation in cities has an influence on their potential for mitigating\nclimate change (Pregitzer et al. 2021). Urban natural areas, particularly forested natural areas, grow in patches and contain many of\nthe same components as non-urban forests, such as high tree density, down woody material, and regenerating trees (Box 8.2, Figure 1).</td>

      <td>Urban forested natural areas have unique benefits as they can provide habitat for native plants and animals, protecting local\nbiodiversity in a fragmented landscape (Di Giulio et al. 2009). Forests can have a greater cooling effect on cities than designed\ngreenspaces, and the bigger the forest the greater the effect (Jaganmohan et al. 2016). In New York City, urban forested natural\nareas have been found to account for the majority of trees estimated in the city (69%), but are a minority of the total tree canopy\n(25%, or 5.5% of the total city land area) (Pregitzer et al. 2019a). In New York City, natural areas are estimated to store a mean of\n263.5 MgC ha&#8211;1 (megagram carbon per hectare), adding up to 1.86 TgC (teragram carbon) across the city, with the majority of carbon\n(86%) being stored in the trees and soils (Pregitzer et al. 2021). These estimates are similar to per-hectare estimates of carbon storage\nacross different pools in non-urban forest types (Table 1), and 1.5 times greater than estimates for carbon stored in just trees across\nthe entire city (Pregitzer et al. 2021).</td>

      <td>Within urban natural areas, the amount of carbon stored varies widely based on vegetation type, tree density, and the species\ncomposition (Box 8.2, Figure 1). The oak-hardwood forest type is one of the most abundant in New York City&#8217;s natural areas and is\ncharacterised by large and long-lived native hardwood tree species, with relatively dense wood. These forests store an estimated\n311.5 MgC ha&#8211;1. However, non-native exotic invasive species can be prevalent in the understory vegetation layer (&lt;1m height), and\naccount for about 50% of cover in New York City (Pregitzer et al. 2019b).</td>
