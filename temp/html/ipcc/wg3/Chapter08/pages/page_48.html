Using green infrastructure delays the time to runoff and reduces water volume but depends on the magnitude of floods (Qin et al. 2013). Measures are most effective for flood mitigation at a&#160;local scale; however, as the size of the catchment increases, the effectiveness of reducing peak discharge decreases (Fiori and Volpi 2020). Reduction of water volume through infiltration can be more effective with rainfall events on a&#160;lower return rate. Overall, the required capacity for piped engineered systems for water runoff attenuation and mitigation can be reduced while lowering flow rates, controlling pollution transport, and increasing the capacity to store stormwater (Srishantha and Rathnayake 2017). Benefits for flood mitigation require a&#160;careful consideration of the spatial context of the urban area, the heterogeneity of the rainfall events, and characteristics of implementation (Qiu et al. 2021). Maintenance costs and stakeholder coordination are other aspects requiring attention (Mguni et al. 2016).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.08" top="402.64"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.59; y0: 402.64; y1: 412.14; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="402.64" x1="299.08">Providing a&#160;connected system of greenspace throughout the urban area may promote active transportation (Nieuwenhuijsen and Khreis 2016), thereby reducing GHG emissions.

In addition, participants were willing to cycle 1.84 km longer if the route has a&#160;designated cycle track and 0.8 km more if there are also green surroundings. Changes in urban landscapes, including through the integration of green infrastructure in sustainable urban and transport planning, can support the transition from private motorised transportation to public and physically active transportation in carbon-neutral, more liveable and healthier cities (Nieuwenhuijsen and Khreis 2016; Nieuwenhuijsen 2020). Car infrastructure can be also transferred into public open and green space, such as in the Superblock model in Barcelona&#8217;s neighbourhoods (Rueda 2019). Health impact assessment models estimated that 681 premature deaths may be prevented annually with this implementation (Mueller et al. 2020) and the creation of greenways in Maanshan, China has stimulated interest in walking or cycling (Zhang et al. 2020).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="458.98" top="726.48"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.74; y0: 726.48; y1: 736.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="309.54" y0="726.48" x1="458.98">8.4.5 Socio-behavioural Aspects</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.62" top="702.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 315.17; y0: 702.6; y1: 712.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="702.6" x1="557.62">Urban systems shape the behaviour and social structures of their residents through urban form, energy systems, and infrastructure&#160;&#8211; all of which provide a&#160;range of options for consumers to make choices about residential location, mobility, energy sources, and the consumption of materials, food, and other resources. The relative availability of options across these sectors has implications on urban emissions through individual behaviour. In turn, urban GHG emissions, as well as emissions from the supply chains of cities, are driven by the behaviour and consumption patterns of residents, with households accounting for over 60% of carbon emissions globally (Ivanova et al. 2016). The exclusion of consumption-based emissions and emissions that occur outside of city boundaries as a&#160;result of urban activities, however, will lead to significant undercounting.

Cities can support voluntary shift to walking, cycling, and transit instead of car use through changes to urban form, such as TOD (Kamruzzaman et al. 2015), increased density of form with co-location of activities (Ma et al. 2015; Ding et al. 2017; Duranton and Turner 2018; Masoumi 2019), and greater intersection density and street integration (Koohsari et al. 2016).
