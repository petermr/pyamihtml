This is typically observed in countries with a&#160;large urban-rural disparity in income and basic services, and where urbanisation is accompanied by economic growth that is coupled to emissions. In addition, the outward expansion of urban land areas often results in the conversion and loss of agricultural land (Pandey et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2019), forests (Austin et al. 2019), and other vegetated areas, thereby reducing carbon uptake and storage (Quesada et al. 2018) (Section&#160;8.3.1). Furthermore, the buildup and use of urban infrastructure (e.g.,&#160;buildings, power, sanitation) requires large amounts of embodied energy and carbon (Figures&#160;8.17 and 8.22).

Considering existing trends, earlier phases of urbanisation accompanied by rapid industrialisation, development of secondary industries, and high levels of economic growth, are correlated with higher levels of energy consumption and GHG emissions. However, more mature phases of urbanisation, with higher levels of economic development and establishment of the service sector, are correlated with lower levels of energy consumption and GHG emissions (Khan and Su 2021).</span></div></body></html>
