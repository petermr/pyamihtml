      <td>Urbanisation can drive emissions if the process is accompanied by an income increase and higher levels of consumption (Sudmant et al.\n2018). This is typically observed in countries with a large urban-rural disparity in income and basic services, and where urbanisation is\naccompanied by economic growth that is coupled to emissions. In addition, the outward expansion of urban land areas often results\nin the conversion and loss of agricultural land (Pandey et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2019), forests (Austin et al. 2019), and other vegetated\nareas, thereby reducing carbon uptake and storage (Quesada et al. 2018) (Section 8.3.1). Furthermore, the buildup and use of urban\ninfrastructure (e.g., buildings, power, sanitation) requires large amounts of embodied energy and carbon (Figures 8.17 and 8.22).\nBuilding new and upgrading existing urban infrastructure could produce cumulative emissions of 226 GtCO by 2050 (Bai et al. 2018).\n2</td>

      <td>However, for the same level of consumption and basic services, an average urban dweller often requires less energy than their\nrural counterparts, due to higher population densities that enable sharing of infrastructure and services, and economies of scale.\nWhether and to what extent such emission reduction potentials can be realised depends on how cities are designed and laid out\n(i.e., urban form &#8211; see Section 8.4.2) as well as how urban infrastructure is built and powered, such as the energy intensity of the\ncity&#8217;s transportation system, type and level of urban services, the share of renewable energy, as well as the broader national and\ninternational economic and energy structure that supports the function of the cities (Sections 8.4.3 and 8.6).</td>

      <td>Although population-dense cities can be more efficient than rural areas in terms of per capita energy use, and cities contribute less\nGHG emissions per person than low-density suburbs (Jones and Kammen 2014), there is some, albeit limited, evidence that larger\ncities are not more efficient than smaller ones (Fragkias et al. 2013; Ribeiro et al. 2019). A number of studies comparing urban and rural\nresidents in the same country have shown that urban residents have higher per capita energy consumption and CO emissions (Chen\n2\net al. 2019a; Hachaichi and Baouni 2021). There is some evidence that the benefits of higher urban densities on reducing per capita\nurban GHG emissions may be offset by higher incomes, smaller household sizes, and, most importantly, higher consumption levels,\nthus creating a counter-effect that could increase GHG emissions with urbanisation (Gill and Moeller 2018).</td>

      <td>Many studies have shown that the relationship between urbanisation and GHG emissions is dependent on the level and stage of\nurban development, and follows an inverted U-shaped relationship of the environmental Kuznets curve (Wang et al. 2016, 2022; Zhang\net al. 2017; Xu et al. 2018a; Zhou et al. 2019) (Sections 8.3.1 and 8.6, and Figure 8.20). Considering existing trends, earlier phases of\nurbanisation accompanied by rapid industrialisation, development of secondary industries, and high levels of economic growth, are\ncorrelated with higher levels of energy consumption and GHG emissions. However, more mature phases of urbanisation, with higher\nlevels of economic development and establishment of the service sector, are correlated with lower levels of energy consumption and\nGHG emissions (Khan and Su 2021).</td>
