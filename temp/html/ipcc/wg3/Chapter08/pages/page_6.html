The&#160;starting point for that chapter was how the spatial organisation of urban settlements affects greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and how urban form and infrastructure could facilitate mitigation of climate change. A&#160;main finding in AR5 was that urban form shapes urban energy consumption and GHG emissions.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.1" top="570.61"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.24; y0: 570.61; y1: 580.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="570.61" x1="299.1">Since AR5, there has been growing scientific literature and policy foci on urban strategies for climate change mitigation. There are three possible reasons for this. First, according to AR5 Working Group III (WGIII) Chapter&#160;12 on Human Settlements, Infrastructure, and Spatial Planning, urban areas generate between 71% and 76% of carbon dioxide (CO</span><span style="x0: 93.99; x1: 97.18; y0: 509.41; y1: 516.06; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="93.99" y0="509.41" x1="97.18">2</span><span style="x0: 97.18; x1: 99.82; y0: 510.6; y1: 520.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="97.18" y0="510.6" x1="299.09">) emissions from global final energy use and between 67% and 76% of global energy (Seto et al. 2014). Thus, focusing on &#8216;urban systems&#8217; (see Annex I: Glossary and Figure&#160;8.15) addresses one of the key drivers of emissions. Second, more than half of the world population lives in urban areas, and by mid-century 7&#160;out of&#160;10&#160;people on the planet will live in a&#160;town or a&#160;city (UN DESA 2019). Thus, coming up with mitigation strategies that are relevant to urban settlements is critical for successful mitigation of climate change. Third, beyond climate change, there is growing attention on cities as major catalysts of change and to help achieve the objectives outlined in multiple international frameworks and assessments.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.04" top="366.62"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.12; y0: 366.62; y1: 376.12; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="366.62" x1="299.04">Cities are also gaining traction within the work of the IPCC.&#160;The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&#176;C (SR1.5 Chapter&#160;4) identified four systems that urgently need to change in fundamental and transformative ways: urban infrastructure, land use and ecosystems, industry, and energy. Urban infrastructure was singled out but urban systems form a&#160;pivotal part of the other three systems requiring change (IPCC 2018a) (see &#8216;infrastructure&#8217; in Glossary). The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) identified cities not only as spatial units for land-based mitigation options but also places for managing demand for natural resources including food, fibre, and water (IPCC 2019).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.09" top="222.64"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.83; y0: 222.64; y1: 232.14; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="222.64" x1="299.09">Other international frameworks are highlighting the importance of cities. For example, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report on nature&#8217;s contribution to people is clear: cities straddle the biodiversity sphere in the sense that they present spatial units of ecosystem fragmentation and degradation while at the same time contain spatial units where the concentration of biodiversity compares favourably with some landscapes (IPBES 2019a). Cities are also featured as a&#160;key element in the transformational governance to tackle both climate change and biodiversity and ecosystem challenges in the first-ever IPCC-IPBES co-sponsored workshop report (P&#246;rtner et al. 2021) (Section&#160;8.5 and see &#8216;governance&#8217; in Glossary).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.07" top="66.66"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.24; y0: 66.66; y1: 76.16; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="66.66" x1="299.07">The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) further underscore the importance of cities in the international arena with the inclusion </span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.59" top="726.66"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.12; y0: 726.66; y1: 736.16; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="726.66" x1="557.59">of SDG 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities for &#8216;inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable&#8217; cities and human settlements (United&#160;Nations 2015; Queiroz et al. 2017; United Nations 2019).

In particular, the nexus approach, such as the water and energy nexus and the water-energy-food nexus, is increasingly being used to understand potential emissions and energy savings from cross-sectoral linkages that occur in cities (Wang and Chen 2016; Engstr&#246;m et al. 2017; Valek et al. 2017). There is also a&#160;growing literature that aims to quantify transboundary urban GHG emissions and carbon footprint beyond urban and national administrative boundaries (Chen et al. 2016; Hu&#160;et al. 2016). Such a&#160;scope provides a&#160;more complete understanding of how local urban emissions or local mitigation strategies can have effects on regions&#8217; carbon footprint or GHG emissions.</span></div><div left="309.54" right="421.61" top="342.48"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.34; y0: 342.48; y1: 352.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="342.48" x1="421.61">8.1.1.1 City Climate Action</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.59" top="318.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 316.93; y0: 318.6; y1: 328.1; width: 7.39; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="318.6" x1="557.59">Moreover, cities around the world are putting increasing focus on tackling climate change.
