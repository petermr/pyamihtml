While green municipal bonds still account for a&#160;small share of the whole green bond market in 2020, scale is predicted to grow further in emerging markets over the coming years. Green municipal bonds have great potential for cities to expand and diversify their investor base. In addition, the process of issuing green municipal bonds is expected to promote cross-sector cooperation within a&#160;city by bringing together various agencies responsible for finance, climate change, infrastructure, planning and design, and operation.

The lack of creditworthiness is one of the main problems preventing cities from issuing green municipal bonds in developing countries. As a&#160;prerequisite for the application of municipal debt-financing, it is an essential condition for cities to ensure sufficient own revenues from low-carbon urbanisation, or the default risk becomes too high for potential investors. Indeed, many cities in developed countries and emerging economies have already accumulated substantial amounts of debts through bond insurances, and ongoing debt payments prevent new investments in low-carbon infrastructure projects.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.09" top="402.64"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.84; y0: 402.64; y1: 412.14; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="402.64" x1="299.09">National governments and multilateral development banks might be able to provide support for debt financing by developing municipal creditworthiness programme and issuing sovereign bonds or providing national guarantees for investors (Floater et al. 2017). Another problem with green municipal bonds is the lack of aggregation mechanisms to support various small-scale projects in cities. Asset-backed securities are likely to reduce the default risk for investors through portfolio diversification and create robust pipelines for a&#160;bundle of small-scale projects (Granoff et al. 2016; Floater et al. 2017; Saha and D&#8217;Almeida 2017).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.09" top="270.66"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 53.32; y0: 270.66; y1: 280.16; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="270.66" x1="299.09">In principle, the upfront capital costs of various low-carbon infrastructure projects, including the costs of urban climate finance (dividend and interest payments), are eventually transferred to users and other stakeholders in the forms of taxes, charges, fees, and other revenue sources. Nevertheless, small cities in developing countries are likely to have a&#160;small revenue base, most of which is committed to recurring operating costs, associated with weak revenue collection and management systems. In recent years, there has been scope to apply not only user-based but also land-based funding instruments for the recovery of upfront capital costs (Braun and Hazelroth 2015; Ko&#347;cielniak and G&#243;rka 2016; Floater et al. 2017; Colenbrander et al. 2018b; Zhan and de Jong 2018; Zhan et al. 2018a).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.07" top="114.68"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 53.32; y0: 114.68; y1: 124.18; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="114.68" x1="299.07">In practice, however, the application of land-based or &#8216;land value capture&#8217; funding requires cities to arrange various instruments, including property (both land and building taxes), betterment levies/special assessments, impact fees (exactions), tax increment financing, land readjustment/land pooling, sales of public land/development rights, recurring lease payments, and transfer taxes/stamp duties, </span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.6" top="726.69"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 313.95; y0: 726.69; y1: 736.19; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="726.69" x1="557.6">across sectors in different urban contexts (Suzuki et al. 2015; Chapman 2017; Walters and Gaunter 2017; Berrisford et al.&#160;2018).

Large-scale system transformations are also deeply influenced by factors outside governance and institutions, such as private interests and power dynamics (Jaglin 2014; Tyfield 2014). In some cases, these private interests are tied up with international flows of capital. At the local level, a&#160;lack of empowerment, high upfront costs, inadequate and uncertain funding for mitigation, diverse and conflicting policy objectives, multiple agencies and actors with diverse interests, high levels of informality, and a&#160;siloed approach to climate action are constraining factors to mainstreaming climate action (Beermann </span></div></body></html>
