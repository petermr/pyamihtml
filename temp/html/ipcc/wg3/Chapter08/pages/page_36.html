A&#160;number of detailed case studies on the evolution of urban road networks for cities around the world reveal that the current layout of streets grew out of street networks that were established hundreds of years ago (Strano et al. 2012; Masucci et al. 2013; Mohajeri and Gudmundsson 2014). Furthermore, there is evidence that urban street layout, population growth, urban development, and automobile ownership co-evolve (Li et al. 2019a).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.22" top="186.61"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.07; y0: 186.61; y1: 196.11; width: 4.05; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="186.61" x1="299.22">For cities to break out of mutually reinforcing carbon lock-in, it will require systematic transformation and systems-based planning that integrates mitigation strategies across sectors and geopolitical scales. Urban energy demand patterns are locked-in whenever incremental urban design and planning decisions, coupled with investments in long-lasting infrastructure, such as roads and buildings, take place (Seto et al. 2016). The fundamental building blocks of cities are based on the layout of the street network, the size of city blocks, and the density of street intersections. If not significantly altered, these three factors will continue to shape and lock-in energy demand for decades after their initial construction, influencing the mitigation potential of urban areas (Section&#160;8.4.2 and Figure&#160;8.22).</span></div><div left="309.69" right="557.87" top="294.63"><span style="x0: 309.69; x1: 315.14; y0: 294.63; y1: 304.13; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.69" y0="294.63" x1="557.87">Avoiding carbon lock-in inherently involves decisions that extend beyond the administrative boundaries of cities. This includes pricing of low-emissions technology or materials, such as electric battery or hydrogen vehicles and buses, although cities can support their development and deployment (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;12 in Chapter&#160;16 on Transition Dynamics). In contrast, urban governments in most parts of the world do have powers to set building codes that regulate materials and construction standards for buildings, including heating and cooling technologies, and major appliances. Other examples include zoning that determines the location of buildings, land uses, standards for densities, and the inclusion of energy planning in their building standards and public works, including streets, parks, and open spaces (Blanco et al. 2011; Raven et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="309.69" right="551.28" top="114.48"><span style="x0: 309.69; x1: 314.88; y0: 114.48; y1: 124.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="309.69" y0="114.48" x1="551.28">8.4.2 Spatial Planning, Urban Form, and Infrastructure</span></div><div left="309.69" right="557.89" top="90.6"><span style="x0: 309.69; x1: 315.31; y0: 90.6; y1: 100.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.69" y0="90.6" x1="557.89">Urban form is the resultant pattern and spatial layout of land use, transportation networks, and urban design elements, including the physical urban extent, configuration of streets and building orientation, and the spatial figuration within and throughout cities </span></div><div left="51.62" right="60.65" top="728.83"><span style="x0: 51.62; x1: 53.99; y0: 728.83; y1: 736.83; width: 2.37; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="51.62" y0="728.83" x1="60.65">(b)</span></div><div left="51.02" right="379.15" top="422.55"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 54.72; y0: 422.55; y1: 430.55; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="51.02" y0="422.55" x1="379.15">Figure&#160;8.15 (continued):&#160;Urban systems, lock-in, and cascading effects of mitigation strategies. </span><span style="x0: 380.11; x1: 384.4; y0: 422.55; y1: 430.55; width: 4.3; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="380.11" y0="422.55" x1="557.14">Cities are systems of interconnected sectors, activities, and governance structures.

Mitigation efforts implemented at larger scales of governance or in sectors that transcend urban boundaries, like energy and transportation, can also facilitate and amplify mitigation at the urban scale, as shown by the arrows extending in both directions across layers (a). Because urban areas are connected locally and globally, urban mitigation efforts can also impact other cities and surrounding areas (agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU)). Cities are prone to carbon lock-in due to the numerous reinforcing interactions among urban infrastructures and technologies, institutions, and individual and collective behaviours; see the side arrows extending across the layers in panel (a): the yellow arrow represents the infrastructure and technological lock-in involving user technologies and supporting infrastructure, the blue arrow indicates lock-in of local to international institutions, and the pink arrow represents behavioural lock-in for individuals and society. Urban carbon lock-in is strongly determined by urban form, in particular the layout of streets and land-use mix. The different coloured spatial patterns represent varying levels of co-location of housing and jobs, and mobility options (Figure&#160;8.16). Efforts to break urban carbon lock-in require meta-transformations to break inertia in and among infrastructures, institutions, and behaviours. Source: adapted in part from Seto et al.
