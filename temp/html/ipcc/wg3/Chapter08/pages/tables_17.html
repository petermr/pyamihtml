      <td>climate adaptation and mitigation. Issues associated with cities and urbanisation are covered in substantial depth within all three\nWorking Groups (including WGI Box TS.14, WGII Chapter 6 &#8216;Cities, Settlements and Key Infrastructure&#8217;, WGII regional chapters, WGII\nCross-Chapter Paper &#8216;Cities and Settlements by the Sea&#8217;, and WGIII Chapter 8 &#8216;Urban Systems and Other Settlements&#8217;). This Box\nhighlights key findings from WGII and III and substantial gaps in literature where more research is urgently needed relating to\npolicy action in cities. It describes methods of addressing mitigation and adaptation in an integrated way across sectors and cities\nto advance sustainable development and equity outcomes and assesses the governance and finance solutions required to support\nclimate-resilient responses.</td>

      <td>urban areas, on the infrastructure that supports these communities, as well as people living in distant places (high confidence) (Cai\net al. 2019; Folke et al. 2021). Between 2000 and 2015, the global population in locations that were affected by floods grew by\n58&#8211;86 million (Tellman et al. 2021). The direct economic costs of all extreme events reached USD210&#8211;268 billion in 2020 (Aon 2021;\nMunich RE 2021; WMO 2021) or about USD0.7 billion per day; this figure does not include knock-on costs in supply chains (Kii 2020)\nor lost days of work, implying that the actual economic costs could be far higher. Depending on RCP, between half (RCP2.6) and three-\nquarters (RCP8.5) of the global population could be exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions arising from coupled\nimpacts of extreme heat and humidity by 2100 (Mora et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2019) (see WGII Section 6.2.2.1, WGII Figure 6.3, and\nWGIII Sections 8.2 and 8.3.4).</td>

      <td>Urban systems are now global, as evidenced by the interdependencies between infrastructure, services, and networks driven by\nurban production and consumption; remittance flows and investments reach into rural places, shaping natural resource use far\nfrom the city and bring risk to the city when these places are impacted by climate change (WGIII Section 8.4 and Figure 8.15). This\nmegatrend (Kourtit et al. 2015) amplifies as well as shapes the potential impacts of climate events and integrates the aims and\napproaches for delivering mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development (medium evidence, high agreement) (Dawson et al.\n2018; Tsavdaroglou et al. 2018; Zscheischler et al. 2018). For cities facing flood damage, wide-ranging impacts have been recorded on\nother urban areas near and far (Carter et al. 2021; Simpson et al. 2021) as production and trade is disrupted (Shughrue et al. 2020).\nIn the absence of integrated mitigation and adaptation across and between infrastructure systems and local places, impacts that bring\nurban economies to a standstill can extend into supply chains and across energy networks causing power outages.</td>

      <td>Urban settlements contribute to climate change, generating about 70% of global CO -eq emissions (high confidence) (see\n2\nWGI Box TS.14, WGII Sections 6.1 and 6.2, and WGIII Section 8.3). This global impact feeds back to cities through the exposure of\ninfrastructure, people, and business to the impacts of climate-related hazards. Particularly in larger cities, this climate feedback is\nexacerbated by local choices in urban design, land use, building design, and human behaviour (Vigui&#233; et al. 2020) that shape local\nenvironmental conditions. Both the local and global combine to increase hazardousness. Certain configurations of urban form and\ntheir elements can add up to 2&#176;C to warming; concretisation of open space can increase run-off, and building height and orientation\ninfluences wind direction and strength (see WGII Section 6.3 and WGIII Section 8.4.2).</td>
