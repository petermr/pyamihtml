Urban forests and street trees provide the greatest mitigation benefit because of their ability to sequester and store carbon while simultaneously reducing building energy demand. Moreover, they provide multiple adaptation co-benefits and synergies based on the linkages to the SDGs (Figure&#160;8.4). The assessments of mitigation benefits are dependent on context, scale, and spatial arrangement of each green and blue infrastructure type and their proximity to buildings. Mitigation benefits due to reducing municipal water use are based on reducing wastewater loads that reduce energy use in wastewater treatment plants. The sizes of the bars are illustrative and their relative size is based on the authors&#8217; best understanding and assessment of the literature.</span></div><div left="55.51" right="64.54" top="726.98"><span style="x0: 55.51; x1: 57.88; y0: 726.98; y1: 734.98; width: 2.37; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="55.51" y0="726.98" x1="64.54">(b)</span></div></body></html>
