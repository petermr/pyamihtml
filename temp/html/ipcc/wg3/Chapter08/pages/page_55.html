Urban governments often obtain their powers from provincial, state and/or national governments, and are subjected to laws and regulations to regulate development and implement infrastructure. In addition, the sources of revenue are often set at these levels so that many urban governments rely on state/provincial and national government funds for improving infrastructure, especially transit infrastructure. The increasing financialisation of urban infrastructures is another factor that can make it more difficult for local governments to determine infrastructure choices (O&#8217;Brien et al. 2019). Urban transit system operations, in particular, are heavily subsidised in many countries, both locally and by higher levels of government. As a&#160;result of&#160;this interplay of policy and legal powers among various levels of government, the lock-in nature of urban infrastructures and built environments will require multi-level governance responses to ensure meeting decarbonisation targets. The reliance on state and national policy and/or funding can accelerate or impede the decarbonisation of urban environments (McCarney et al. 2011; McCarney 2019).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.77" top="306.63"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 306.63; y1: 316.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="306.63" x1="304.77">The world&#8217;s infrastructure spending is expected to more than double from 2015 to 2030 under a&#160;low-carbon and climate-resilient scenario. More than 70% of the infrastructure will concentrate in urban areas by requiring USD4.5&#8211;5.4 trillion per year (CCFLA 2015).&#160;However, today&#8217;s climate finance flows for cities or &#8216;urban climate finance&#8217;, estimated at USD384 billion annually on average in 2017/18, are insufficient to meet the USD4.5&#8211;5.4 trillion annual investment needs for urban mitigation actions across key sectors (CCFLA 2015; CPI and World Bank 2021; Negreiros et al. 2021). Low-carbon urban form (e.g.,&#160;compact, high-density, and mixed-use characteristics) is likely to economise spending in infrastructure along with the application of new technologies and renewable energies that would be able to recover the increasing upfront cost of low-carbon infrastructure from more efficient operating and energy savings (</span><span style="x0: 237.27; x1: 244.13; y0: 150.65; y1: 160.15; width: 6.86; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="237.27" y0="150.65" x1="300.17">medium evidence</span><span style="x0: 300.17; x1: 302.45; y0: 150.65; y1: 160.15; width: 2.28; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="300.17" y0="150.65" x1="304.73">, </span><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.27; y0: 138.66; y1: 148.16; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="56.69" y0="138.66" x1="114.22">high agreement</span><span style="x0: 114.22; x1: 116.87; y0: 138.66; y1: 148.16; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="114.22" y0="138.66" x1="304.73">) (Global Commission on the Economy and Climate 2014; Foxon et al. 2015; Bhattacharya et al. 2016; Floater et al. 2017; Colenbrander et al. 2018b).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.73" top="90.66"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.51; y0: 90.66; y1: 100.16; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="90.66" x1="304.73">Governments have traditionally financed a&#160;large proportion of infrastructure investment.
