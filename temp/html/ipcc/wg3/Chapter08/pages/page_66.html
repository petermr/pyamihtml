Many outdoor air pollutants, such as particulates, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds declined during national lockdowns. Levels of tropospheric ozone, however, remained constant or increased. A&#160;promising transformation that has been observed in many cities is an increase in the share of active travel modes such as cycling and walking (Sharifi and Khavarian-Garmsir 2020). While this may be temporary, other trends, such as increased rates of teleworking and/or increased reliance on smart solutions that allow remote provision of services provide an unprecedented opportunity to transform urban travel patterns (Belzunegui-Eraso and Erro-Garc&#233;s 2020; Sharifi and Khavarian-Garmsir 2020).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.11" top="558.62"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.95; y0: 558.62; y1: 568.12; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="558.62" x1="299.11">Related to the transport sector, the pandemic has resulted in concerns regarding the safety of public transport modes, which has resulted in significant reductions in public transport ridership in some cities (Bucsky 2020; de Haas et al. 2020) while providing opportunities for urban transitions in others (Newman AO 2020). Considering the significance of public transportation for achieving low-carbon and inclusive urban development, appropriate response measures could enhance health safety of public transport modes and regain public trust (Sharifi and Khavarian-Garmsir 2020). Similarly, there is a&#160;perceived correlation between the higher densities of urban living and the risk of increased virus transmission (Hamidi et al. 2020; Khavarian-Garmsir et al. 2021).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.05" top="402.64"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 58.59; y0: 402.64; y1: 412.14; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="402.64" x1="299.05">While city size could be a&#160;risk factor with higher transmission in larger cities (Hamidi et al. 2020; Stier et al. 2021), there is also evidence showing that density is not a&#160;major risk factor and indeed cities that are more compact have more capacity to respond to and control the pandemic (Hamidi et al. 2020). Considering the spatial pattern of density, even distribution of density can reduce the possibility of crowding that is found to contribute to the scale and length of virus outbreak in cities. Overall, more research is needed to better understand the impacts of density on outbreak dynamics and address public health concerns for resilient cities.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.07" top="270.66"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.13; y0: 270.66; y1: 280.16; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="270.66" x1="299.07">Cities could seize this opportunity to provide better infrastructure to further foster active transportation. This could, for example, involve measures, such as expanding cycling networks and restricting existing streets to make them more pedestrian- and cycling-friendly contributing to health and adaptation co-benefits, as discussed in Section&#160;8.2 (Sharifi 2021). Strengthening the science&#8211;policy interface is another consideration that could support urban transformation (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;1&#160;in Chapter&#160;1).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="489.93" top="726.48"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.74; y0: 726.48; y1: 736.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="309.54" y0="726.48" x1="489.93">8.7.2 Future Urban Emissions Scenarios</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.58" top="702.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.76; y0: 702.6; y1: 712.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="702.6" x1="557.58">The urban share of global emissions is significant and is expected to increase in the coming decades. This places emphasis on the need to expand development of urban emissions scenarios within climate mitigation scenarios (Gurney et al. 2021, 2022). The literature on globally comprehensive analysis of urban emissions within the existing IPCC scenario framework remains very limited, curtailing understanding of urban emissions tipping points, mitigation opportunities and overall climate policy complexity. A&#160;review of the applications of the SSP-RCP scenario framework also recommended downscaling global SSPs to improve the applicability of this  framework to regional and local scales (O&#8217;Neill et al. 2020). This&#160;remains an urgent need and will require multidisciplinary research efforts, particularly as net-zero-emissions targets are emphasised.</span></div><div left="309.54" right="440.19" top="522.48"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.74; y0: 522.48; y1: 532.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="309.54" y0="522.48" x1="440.19">8.7.3 Urban Emissions Data</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.6" top="498.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.76; y0: 498.6; y1: 508.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="498.6" x1="557.6">Though there has been a&#160;rapid rise in quantification and analysis of urban emissions, gaps remain in comprehensive global coverage, particularly in the Global South, and reliance on standardised frameworks and systematic data are lacking (Gurney and Shepson 2021; Mueller et al. 2021). The development of protocols by (BSI 2013; Fong et al. 2014; ICLEI 2019b) that urban areas can use to organise emissions accounts has been an important step forward, but no single agreed-upon reporting framework exists (Lombardi et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2019b; Ramaswami et al. 2021). Additionally, there is no standardisation of emissions data and limited independent validation procedures (Gurney and Shepson 2021). This is partly driven by the recognition that urban emissions can be conceptualised using different frameworks, each of which has a&#160;different meaning for different urban communities (Section&#160;8.1.6.2). Equally important is the recognition that acquisition and analysis of complex data used to populate urban GHG inventory protocols remains a&#160;barrier for local practitioners (Creutzig et al. 2019). The limited standardisation has also led to incomparability of the many individual or city cluster analyses that have been accomplished since AR5. Finally, comprehensive, global quantification of urban emissions remains incomplete in spite of recent efforts (Moran et al. 2018; Zheng et al. 2018; Harris et al. 2020; Jiang et al. 2020; Wei et al. 2021; Wiedmann et al. 2021).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.6" top="210.64"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.76; y0: 210.64; y1: 220.14; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="210.64" x1="557.6">Similarly, independent verification or evaluation of urban GHG emissions has seen a&#160;large number of research studies (e.g.,&#160;Wu et al. 2016; Sargent et al. 2018; Whetstone 2018; Lauvaux et al. 2020). This has been driven by the recognition that self-reported approaches may not provide adequate accuracy to track emissions changes and provide confidence for mitigation investment (Gurney and Shepson 2021).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.62" top="114.65"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 313.76; y0: 114.65; y1: 124.15; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="114.65" x1="557.62">The most promising approach to independent verification of urban emissions has been the use of urban atmospheric monitoring (direct flux and/or concentration) as a&#160;means to assess and track urban GHG emissions (Davis et al. 2017). However, like the basic accounting approach itself, standardisation and practical deployment and scaling is an essential near-term need.</span></div></body></html>
