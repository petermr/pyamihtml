Heat- demand density is a&#160;function of both population density and heat&#160;demand per capita and can be equally present in urban areas with high population density or high heat demand per capita (M&#246;ller et al. 2019; Persson et al. 2019). Low-temperature networks that utilise waste heat or renewable energy can provide an option to avoid carbon lock-in to fossil fuels while layout and eco-design principles can further optimise such networks (Gang et al. 2016; Buffa et al. 2019; Dominkovi&#263; and Kraja&#269;i&#263; 2019). Replacing gas-based heating and cooling with electrified district heating and cooling networks, for instance, provides 65% emissions reductions also involving carbon-aware scheduling for grid power (De Chalendar et al. 2019). The environmental and ecological benefits increase through the interaction of urban energy and spatial planning (Tuomisto et al. 2015; Bartolozzi et al. 2017; D&#233;nari&#233; et al. 2018; Zhai et al. 2020). These interactions include support for demand-side flexibility, spatial planning using geographic information systems, and access to renewable and urban waste heat sources (M&#246;ller et al. 2018; REN21 2020; Sorkn&#230;s et al. 2020; Doroti&#263; et al. 2019) (see Table&#160;8.SM.2 for other references).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="221.66" top="450.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.89; y0: 450.48; y1: 460.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.69" y0="450.48" x1="221.66">8.4.3 Electrification and Switching  to Net-Zero-Emissions Resources</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.74" top="414.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.26; y0: 414.6; y1: 424.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="414.6" x1="304.74">Pursuing the electrification of mobility, heating, and cooling systems, while decarbonising electricity and energy carriers, and switching to net-zero materials and supply chains, represent important strategies for urban mitigation.

Energy efficiency measures in urban areas can be enabled by urban form, building codes, retrofitting and renovation, modal shifts, and other options. Decarbonising electricity supply raises the mitigation potential of efficient buildings and transport in urban areas to about 75% of the total estimate (Coalition for Urban Transitions 2019). In&#160;addition, relatively higher-density urban areas enable more cost-effective infrastructure investments, including electric public transport and large-scale heat pumps in districts that support electrification. Urban policymakers can play a&#160;key role in supporting carbon-neutral energy systems by acting as target setters and planners, demand aggregators, regulators, operators, conveners, and facilitators for coordinated planning and implementation across sectors, urban form, and demand (IEA 2021a; IRENA 2021).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="233.38" top="150.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.49; y0: 150.48; y1: 160.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="150.48" x1="233.38">8.4.3.1 Electrification and Decarbonisation  of the Urban Energy System</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.74" top="114.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.32; y0: 114.6; y1: 124.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="114.6" x1="304.74">Urban energy infrastructures often operate as part of larger energy systems that can be electrified, decarbonised, and become enablers of urban system flexibility through demand-side options.

Indeed, electrification is already transforming urban areas and settlements and has the potential to continue transforming urban areas into net-negative electric cities that may sequester more carbon than emitted (Kennedy et al. 2018; Seto et al. 2021).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="390.63"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 317.51; y0: 390.63; y1: 400.13; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="390.63" x1="563.28">In its simplest form, electrification involves the process of replacing fossil fuel-based technologies with electrified innovations such as electric vehicles, buses, streetcars, and trains (Sections&#160;10.3 and 10.4), heat pumps, PVs (Section&#160;6.4.2.1), electric cook-stoves (Section&#160;9.8.2.1), and other technologies (Stewart et al. 2018). Cost-effective decarbonisation of energy use can be supported by electrification in urban areas if there is also demand-side flexibility for power, heat, mobility, and water with sector coupling (Guelpa et al. 2019; Pfeifer et al. 2021). Overall, demand-side flexibility across sectors in urban areas is supported by smart charging, electric mobility, electrified urban rail, power-to-heat, demand side response, and water desalination (Lund et al. 2015; Calvillo et al. 2016; Salpakari et al. 2016; Newman 2017; Meschede 2019).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="222.65"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.67; y0: 222.65; y1: 232.15; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="222.65" x1="563.28">As an enabler, electrification supports integrating net-zero energy sources in urban infrastructure across sectors, especially when there is more flexible energy demand in mobility, heating, and cooling to absorb greater shares of variable renewable energy. In the transport sector, smart charging can reduce electric vehicle impacts on peak demand by 60% (IEA 2021a). Urban areas that connect efficient building clusters with the operation of smart thermal grids in district heating and cooling networks with large-scale heat pumps can support higher penetrations of variable renewable energy in smart energy systems (Lund et al. 2014, 2017). Higher urban densities provide the advantage of increasing the penetration of renewable power for deep decarbonisation, including mixed-use neighbourhoods for grid balancing and electric public transport (Hsieh et al. 2017; Tong et al. 2017; Fichera et al. 2018; Kobashi et al. 2020).
