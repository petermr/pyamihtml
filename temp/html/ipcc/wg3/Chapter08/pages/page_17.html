Issues associated with cities and urbanisation are covered in substantial depth within all three Working Groups (including WGI Box TS.14, WGII Chapter&#160;6&#160;&#8216;Cities, Settlements and Key Infrastructure&#8217;, WGII regional chapters, WGII Cross-Chapter Paper &#8216;Cities and Settlements by the Sea&#8217;, and WGIII Chapter&#160;8&#160;&#8216;Urban Systems and Other Settlements&#8217;). This Box highlights key findings from WGII and III and substantial gaps in literature where more research is urgently needed relating to policy action in cities. It describes methods of addressing mitigation and adaptation in an integrated way across sectors and cities to advance sustainable development and equity outcomes and assesses the governance and finance solutions required to support climate-resilient responses.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="505.83" top="426.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 76.98; y0: 426.48; y1: 436.48; width: 6.11; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="426.48" x1="505.83">Urbanisation: A&#160;megatrend driving global climate risk and potential for low-carbon and resilient futures</span><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 414.6; y1: 424.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="414.6" x1="549.13">Severe weather events, exacerbated by anthropogenic emissions, are already having devastating impacts on people who live in urban areas, on the infrastructure that supports these communities, as well as people living in distant places (</span><span style="x0: 470.01; x1: 474.59; y0: 402.6; y1: 412.1; width: 4.58; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-CondensedIta;" x0="470.01" y0="402.6" x1="527.35">high confidence</span><span style="x0: 527.35; x1: 529.99; y0: 402.6; y1: 412.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="527.35" y0="402.6" x1="549.14">) (Cai et al. 2019; Folke et al. 2021).

Depending on RCP, between half (RCP2.6) and three-quarters (RCP8.5) of the global population could be exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions arising from coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity by 2100 (Mora et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2019) (see WGII Section&#160;6.2.2.1, WGII Figure&#160;6.3, and WGIII Sections&#160;8.2 and 8.3.4).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="549.07" top="294.62"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 76.49; y0: 294.62; y1: 304.12; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="294.62" x1="549.07">Urban systems are now global, as evidenced by the interdependencies between infrastructure, services, and networks driven by urban production and consumption; remittance flows and investments reach into rural places, shaping natural resource use far from the city and bring risk to the city when these places are impacted by climate change (WGIII Section&#160;8.4 and Figure&#160;8.15).

This global impact feeds back to cities through the exposure of infrastructure, people, and business to the impacts of climate-related hazards. Particularly in larger cities, this climate feedback is exacerbated by local choices in urban design, land use, building design, and human behaviour (Vigui&#233; et al. 2020) that shape local environmental conditions. Both the local and global combine to increase hazardousness. Certain configurations of urban form and their elements can add up to 2&#176;C to warming; concretisation of open space can increase run-off, and building height and orientation influences wind direction and strength (see WGII Section&#160;6.3 and WGIII Section&#160;8.4.2).</span></div></body></html>
