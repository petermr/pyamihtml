Established urban areas that are already compact and walkable have captured mitigation benefits from these illustrative strategies to various extents. Conversely, established urban areas that are dispersed and auto-centric have foregone these opportunities, with the exception of urban infill and densification that can be used to transform or continue to transform the existing urban form. Figure&#160;8.21 underscores that urban mitigation options and illustrative strategies differ by urban growth typologies and urban form. Cities can identify their entry points for sequencing mitigation strategies.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.74" top="558.62"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 558.62; y1: 568.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="558.62" x1="304.74">The emissions reduction potential of urban mitigation options further varies based on governance contexts, institutional capacity, and economic structure, as well as human and physical geography. According to the development level, for instance, urban form can remain mostly planned or unplanned, taking place spontaneously, with persistent urban infrastructure gaps remaining (Lwasa et al. 2018; Kareem et al. 2020). Measures for closing the urban infrastructure gap while addressing &#8216;leapfrogging&#8217; opportunities (see Glossary) for mitigation and providing co-benefits represent possibilities for shifting development paths for sustainability (Cross-Chapter Box&#160;5&#160;in Chapter&#160;4).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="218.12" top="402.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.89; y0: 402.48; y1: 412.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.69" y0="402.48" x1="218.12">8.6.1 Mitigation Opportunities for </span><span style="x0: 218.12; x1: 223.12; y0: 402.48; y1: 412.48; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCnIta;" x0="218.12" y0="402.48" x1="268.51">Established </span><span style="x0: 268.51; x1: 274.07; y0: 402.48; y1: 412.48; width: 5.56; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="268.51" y0="402.48" x1="291.86">Cities</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.92" top="378.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.44; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 4.75; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.69" y0="378.6" x1="304.92">Established cities will achieve the largest GHG emissions savings by replacing, repurposing, or retrofitting the building stock, encouraging modal shift, electrifying the urban energy system, as well as infilling and densifying urban areas.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.73" top="318.61"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 318.61; y1: 328.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="318.61" x1="304.73">Shifting pathways to low-carbon development for established cities with existing infrastructures and locked-in behaviours and lifestyles is admittedly challenging. Urban infrastructures such as buildings, roads, and pipelines often have long lifetimes that lock-in emissions, as well as institutional and individual behaviour. Although the expected lifetime of buildings varies considerably by geography, design, and materials, typical lifespans are at minimum 30 years to more than 100 years.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.74" top="210.62"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.79; y0: 210.62; y1: 220.12; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="210.62" x1="304.74">Cities where urban infrastructure has already been built have opportunities to increase energy efficiency measures, prioritise compact and mixed-use neighbourhoods through urban regeneration, advance the urban energy system through electrification, undertake cross-sector synergies, integrate urban green and blue infrastructure, encourage behavioural and lifestyle change to reinforce climate mitigation, and put into place a&#160;wide range of enabling conditions as necessary to guide and coordinate actions in the urban system and its impacts in the global system. Retrofitting buildings with state of the art deep-energy retrofit measures could reduce emissions of the existing stock by about 30&#8211;60% (Creutzig et al. 2016a) and in some cases up to 80% (&#220;rge-Vorsatz et al. 2020) (Section&#160;8.4.3).</span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.27" top="726.64"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.61; y0: 726.64; y1: 736.14; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="726.64" x1="563.27">Established cities that are compact and walkable are likely to have low per capita emissions, and thus can keep emissions low by focusing on electrification of all urban energy services and using urban green and blue infrastructure to sequester and store carbon while reducing urban heat stress. Illustrative mitigation strategies with the highest mitigation potential are decarbonising electricity and energy carriers while electrifying mobility, heating, and cooling (Table&#160;8.3 and Figure&#160;8.19). Within integrated strategies, the importance of urban forests, street trees, and green space as well as green roofs, walls, and retrofits, also have high mitigation potential (Section&#160;8.4.4 and Figure&#160;8.18).</span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.28" top="582.66"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.61; y0: 582.66; y1: 592.16; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="582.66" x1="563.28">Established cities that are dispersed and auto-centric are likely to have higher per capita emissions and thus can reduce emissions by focusing on creating modal shift and improving public transit systems in order to reduce urban transport emissions, as well as focusing on infilling and densifying. Only then can the urban form constraints on locational and mobility options be effective at reducing transport-based emissions. Among mitigation options based on spatial planning, urban form, and infrastructure, urban&#160;infill and&#160;densification has priority. For these cities, the use of urban green and blue infrastructure will be essential to offset residual emissions that cannot be reduced because their urban form is already established and difficult to change.</span></div><div left="315.22" right="561.01" top="426.68"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.43; y0: 426.68; y1: 436.18; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="426.68" x1="561.01">System-wide energy savings and emissions reductions for low-carbon urban development are widely recognised to require both behavioural and structural changes (Zhang and Li 2017). Synergies between social and ecological innovation can reinforce the sustainability of urban systems while decoupling energy usage and economic growth (Hu et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2018). In addition, an integrated sustainable development approach that enables cross-sector energy efficiency, sustainable transport, renewable energy, and local development in urban neighbourhoods can address issues of energy poverty (Puk&#353;ec et al. 2018). In this context, cross-sectoral, multi-scale, and public-private collaborative action is crucial to steer societies and cities closer to low-carbon futures (H&#246;lscher et al. 2019). Such actions include guiding residential living area per capita, limiting private vehicle growth, expanding public transport, improving the efficiency of urban infrastructure, enhancing urban carbon pools, and minimising waste through sustainable, ideally circular, waste management (Lin et al. 2018). Through a&#160;coordinated approach, urban areas can be transformed into hubs for renewable and distributed energy, sustainable mobility, as well as inclusivity and health (Newman et al. 2017; Newman 2020).</span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.26" top="174.71"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 320.84; y0: 174.71; y1: 184.21; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="174.71" x1="563.26">Urban design for existing urban areas includes strategies for urban energy transitions for carbon neutrality based on renewable energy, district heating for the city centre and suburbs, as well as green and blue interfaces (Pulselli et al. 2021). Integrated modelling approaches for urban energy system planning, including land use and transport and flexible demand-side options, is increased when municipal actors are also recognised as energy planners (Yazdanie and Orehounig 2021) (Section&#160;8.4.3). Enablers for action can include the co-design of infill residential development through an inclusive and participatory process with citizen utilities and disruptive innovation that can support net-zero-carbon power while contributing to 1.5&#176;C pathways, </span></div></body></html>
