The environmental and ecological benefits of electrification of the urban energy system include improved air quality based on a&#160;shift to non-polluting energy sources (Jacobson et al. 2018; Ajanovic and Haas 2019; Bagheri et al. 2019; Gai et al. 2020). Across 74 metropolitan areas around the world, an estimated 408,270 lives per year are saved due to air quality improvements that stem from a&#160;move to 100% renewable energy (Jacobson et al. 2020). Other studies indicate that there is potential to reduce premature mortality by up to 7000 people in 53 towns and cities, to create 93,000 new jobs, and to lower global climate costs and personal energy costs, through renewable energy transformations (Jacobson et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="558.62"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.15; y0: 558.62; y1: 568.12; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="558.62" x1="304.75">Across 146 signatories of a&#160;city climate network, local energy-saving measures led to 6596 avoided premature deaths and 68,476 years of life saved due to improved air quality (Monforti-Ferrario et al. 2018). Better air quality further reinforces the health co-benefits of climate mitigation measures based on walking and bicycling since evidence suggests that increased physical activity in urban outdoor settings with low levels of black carbon improves lung function (Laeremans et al. 2018). Physical activity can also be fostered through urban design measures and policies that promote the development of ample and well-connected parks and open spaces, and can lead to physical and mental health benefits (Kabisch et al. 2016) (Section&#160;8.4.4 and Figure&#160;8.18).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="402.64"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.79; y0: 402.64; y1: 412.14; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="402.64" x1="304.76">Cities in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand show that reducing emissions from major sources (e.g.,&#160;transport, residential burning, biomass open burning, and industry) could bring substantial  co-benefits of avoided deaths from reduced PM</span><span style="x0: 238.27; x1: 241.47; y0: 365.41; y1: 372.06; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="238.27" y0="365.41" x1="247.85">2.5 </span><span style="x0: 249.11; x1: 251.75; y0: 366.6; y1: 376.1; width: 2.64; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="249.11" y0="366.6" x1="304.74">(fine inhalable particulates) emissions and radiative forcing from black carbon (Pathak and Shukla 2016; Dhar et al. 2017; Permadi et al. 2017; Karlsson et al. 2020), reduced noise, and reduced traffic injuries (Kwan and Hashim 2016). Compact city policies and interventions that support a&#160;modal shift away from private motor vehicles towards walking, cycling, and low-emission public transport delivers significant public health benefits (Creutzig 2016; &#220;rge-Vorsatz et al. 2018). Trade-offs associated with compact development include the marginal health costs of transport air pollution (Lohrey and Creutzig 2016) and stress from traffic noise (Gruebner et al. 2017) (Section&#160;8.4.2.3).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.71" top="222.62"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.32; y0: 222.62; y1: 232.12; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="222.62" x1="304.71">Urban green and blue infrastructure&#160;&#8211; a subset of nature-based solutions (NBS)&#160;&#8211; acts as both climate mitigation and adaptation measures by reducing heat stress (Kim and Coseo 2018; Privitera and La Rosa 2018; Herath et al. 2021), improving air quality, reducing noise (Scholz et al. 2018; De la Sota et al. 2019), improving urban biodiversity (Hall et al. 2017b), and enhancing well-being, including contributions to local development (Lwasa et al. 2015). Health benefits from urban forestry and green infrastructure include reduced cardiovascular morbidity, improved mental health (van den Bosch and Ode Sang 2017; Vujcic et al. 2017; Al-Kindi et al. 2020; Sharifi et al. 2021), raised birth weight (Dzhambov et al. 2014), and increased life expectancy (Jonker et al. 2014).

Transport-related measures, such as transportation demand management, transit-oriented development (TOD), and promotion of active transport modes provide economic co-benefits through, for example, reducing health care costs linked with pollution and cardiovascular diseases, improving labour productivity, and decreasing congestion costs (including waste of time and money) (Sharifi et al. 2021). As a&#160;case-in-point, data from cities such as Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Manila, Beijing, Mexico City, Dakar, and Buenos Aires indicate that economic costs of congestion account for a&#160;considerable share of their gross domestic product (GDP), ranging from 0.7% to 15.0% (Dulal 2017) (Section&#160;8.4.2).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.3" top="354.64"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.43; y0: 354.64; y1: 364.14; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="354.64" x1="563.3">Since policy interventions can result in negative impacts or trade-offs with other objectives, fostering accessibility, equity, and inclusivity for disadvantaged groups is essential (Vigui&#233; and Hallegatte 2012; Sharifi 2020; P&#246;rtner et al. 2021). Anti-sprawl policies that aim to increase density, or the introduction of large green areas in cities could increase property prices, resulting in trade-offs with affordable housing and pushing urban poor further away from cities (Reckien et al. 2017; Alves et al. 2019). Deliberate strategies can improve access of low-income populations to jobs, and gender-responsive transport systems that can enhance women&#8217;s mobility and financial independence (Vigui&#233; and Hallegatte 2012; Lecompte and Juan Pablo 2017; Reckien et al. 2017; Priya Uteng and Turner 2019).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.24" top="198.66"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 319.08; y0: 198.66; y1: 208.16; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="198.66" x1="563.24">Low-carbon urban development that triggers economic decoupling and involves capacity-building measures could have a&#160;positive impact on employment and local competitiveness (Dodman 2009; Kalmykova et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2018b; Garc&#237;a-Gusano et al. 2018; Hu et al. 2018; Shen et al. 2018). Sustainable and low-carbon urban development that integrates issues of equity, inclusivity, and affordability while safeguarding urban livelihoods, providing access to basic services, lowering energy bills, addressing energy poverty, and improving public health, can also improve the distributional effects of existing and future urbanisation (Friend et al. 2016; Claude et al.&#160;2017; Colenbrander et al. 2017; Ma et al. 2018; Mr&#243;wczy&#324;ska et al. 2018; Puk&#353;ec et al. 2018; Wiktorowicz et al. 2018; Ramaswami 2020).</span></div></body></html>
