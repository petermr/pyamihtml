Integrated policymaking can increase the energy, material, and emissions benefits in the waste management sector (Hjalmarsson 2015; Fang et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2017). Organisational structure and programme administration poses demands for institutional capacity, governance, and cross-sectoral coordination for obtaining the maximum benefit (Hjalmarsson 2015; Kalmykova et al. 2016; Conke 2018; Marino et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2018).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.08" top="594.62"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 55.24; y0: 594.62; y1: 604.12; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="594.62" x1="299.08">The informal sector plays a&#160;critical role in waste management, particularly but not exclusively in developing countries (Linzner and Lange 2013; Dias 2016). Sharing of costs and benefits, and&#160;transforming informality of waste recycling activities into programmes, can support distributional effects (Conke 2018; Grov&#233; et al. 2018). Balancing centralised and decentralised waste management options along low-carbon objectives can address potential challenges in transforming informality (de Bercegol and Gowda 2019). Overall, the positive impacts of waste management on employment and economic growth can be increased when informality is transformed to stimulate employment opportunities for value-added products with an estimated 45 million jobs in the waste management sector by 2030 (Alzate-Arias et al. 2018; Coalition for Urban Transitions 2020; Soukiazis and Proen&#231;a 2020).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="180.09" top="402.48"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.22; y0: 402.48; y1: 412.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="51.02" y0="402.48" x1="180.09">8.4.6 Urban-Rural Linkages</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.08" top="378.6"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.65; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="378.6" x1="299.08">Urban-rural linkages, especially through waste, food, and water, are prominent elements of the urban system, given that cities are open systems that depend on their hinterlands for imports and exports (Pichler et al. 2017), and include resources, products for industrial production or final use (Section&#160;8.1.6). As supply chains are becoming increasingly global in nature, so are the resource flows with the hinterlands of cities. In addition to measures within the jurisdictional boundaries of cities, cities can influence large upstream emissions through their supply chains, as well as through activities that rely on resources outside city limits. The dual strategy of implementing local actions and taking responsibility for the entire supply chains of&#160;imported and exported goods can reduce GHG emissions outside of  a&#160;city&#8217;s administrative boundaries (Figure&#160;8.15).</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.08" top="210.62"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 58.59; y0: 210.62; y1: 220.12; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="210.62" x1="299.08">Waste prevention, minimisation, and management provides the potential of alleviating resource usage and upstream emissions from urban settlements (Swilling et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2020a; Harris et al. 2020). Integrated waste management and zero-waste targets can allow urban areas to maximise the mitigation potential while reducing pressures on land use and the environment. This mitigation option reduces emissions due to (i) avoided emissions upstream in the supply chain of materials based on measures for recycling and the reuse of materials; (ii) avoided emissions due to land-use changes as well as emissions that are released into the atmosphere from waste disposal; and (ii) avoided primary energy (see Glossary) spending and emissions. Socio-behavioural change that reduces waste generation, combined with technology and infrastructure according to the waste hierarchy, can be especially effective.

Reducing food demand from urban hinterlands can have a&#160;positive impact on energy and water demand for food production (Eigenbrod and Gruda 2015) (see &#8216;food system&#8217; in Glossary). Managing food waste in urban areas through recycling or reduction of food waste at source of consumption would require behavioural change (Gu et al. 2019). Urban governments could also support shifts towards more climate-friendly diets, including through procurement policies. These strategies have created economic opportunities or have enhanced food security while reducing the emissions that are associated with waste and the transportation of food. Strategies for managing food&#160;demand in urban areas would depend on the integration of food systems in urban planning.</span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.61" top="438.68"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 315.17; y0: 438.68; y1: 448.18; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="438.68" x1="557.61">Urban and peri-urban agriculture and forestry is pursued by both developing and some developed country cities.

Reducing energy use for urban water systems involves reducing energy requirements for water supply, purification, distribution, and drainage (Ahmad et al. 2020).
