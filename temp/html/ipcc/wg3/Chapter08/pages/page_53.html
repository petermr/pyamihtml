Shanghai was designated as one of the pilot low-carbon cities by the central government. The city utilised a&#160;coordination mechanism for joining fragmented policymaking across the city&#8217;s economy, energy, and environment. The coordination mechanism was supported by a&#160;direct fund that enabled implementation of cross-sector policies beyond a&#160;single-sector focus across multiple institutions while increasing capacity for enabling a&#160;low-carbon transition for urban sustainability (Peng and Bai 2020).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="241.19" top="534.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 73.65; y0: 534.48; y1: 544.48; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="534.48" x1="241.19">Implementation and governance process</span><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 73.17; y0: 522.6; y1: 532.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="522.6" x1="549.12">In Shanghai, coordination between the central and local governments had an instrumental role for encouraging low-carbon policy experimentation. Using a&#160;nested governance framework, the central government provided target setting and performance evaluation while the local government initiated pilot projects for low-carbon development. The policy practices in Shanghai surpassed the top-down targets and annual reporting of GHG emissions, including carbon labelling standards at the local level, pilot programme for transitioning sub-urban areas, and the engagement of public utilities (Peng and Bai 2018).</span></div><div left="70.87" right="239.79" top="450.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.68; y0: 450.48; y1: 460.48; width: 4.81; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="450.48" x1="239.79">Towards low-carbon urban development</span><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 76.68; y0: 438.6; y1: 448.1; width: 5.81; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="438.6" x1="549.07">New policy measures in Shanghai were built upon a&#160;series of related policies from earlier, ranging from general energy saving measures to air pollution reduction. This provided a&#160;continuum of policy learning for implementing low-carbon policy measures. An&#160;earlier policy was a&#160;green electricity scheme based on the Jade Electricity Program while the need for greater public awareness was one aspect requiring further attention in policy design (Baeumler et al. 2012), supporting policy-learning for policies later on. The&#160;key point here is that low-carbon policies were built on and learned from earlier policies with similar goals.</span></div><div left="70.87" right="238.55" top="366.48"><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 77.35; y0: 366.48; y1: 376.48; width: 6.48; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="70.87" y0="366.48" x1="238.55">Outcomes and impacts of the policy mix</span><span style="x0: 70.87; x1: 75.08; y0: 354.6; y1: 364.1; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="70.87" y0="354.6" x1="549.12">Trends during 1998 and 2015 indicate that energy intensity decreased from about 130 tonnes per million RMB to about 45 tonnes per million RMB and carbon intensity decreased from about 0.35 Mt per billion RMB to 0.10 Mt per billion RMB (Peng and Bai 2018). These impacts on energy and carbon intensities represent progress, while challenges remain. Among the challenges are the need for investment in low-carbon technology and increases in urban carbon sinks (Yang and Li 2018) while cross-sector interaction and complexity are increasing.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="301.04" top="258.48"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 61.89; y0: 258.48; y1: 268.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="56.69" y0="258.48" x1="301.04">8.5.2 Mitigation Potential of Urban Subnational Actors</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.88" top="234.6"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 62.15; y0: 234.6; y1: 244.1; width: 5.45; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="234.6" x1="304.88">A significant research question that has been paid more attention in both the scientific and policy communities is related to subnational actors&#8217; role in and contribution to global climate mitigation.
