      <td>Designing for resilient and low-carbon cities today is far easier than retrofitting for risk reduction tomorrow. As urbanisation unfolds,\nits legacy continues to be the locking-in of emissions and vulnerabilities (high confidence) (Seto et al. 2016; &#220;rge-Vorsatz et al.\n2018) (see WGIII Section 8.4 and Figure 8.15). Retrofitting, disaster reconstruction, and urban regeneration programmes offer scope\nfor strategic direction changes to low-carbon and high-resilience urban form and function, so long as they are inclusive in design\nand implementation. Rapid urban growth means new investment, new buildings and infrastructure, new demands for energy and\ntransport and new questions about what a healthy and fulfilling urban life can be. The USD90 trillion expected to be invested in new\nurban development by 2030 (NCE 2018) is a global opportunity to place adaptation and mitigation directly into urban infrastructure\nand planning, as well as to consider social policy including education, health care, and environmental management (&#220;rge-Vorsatz\net al. 2018). If this opportunity is missed, and business-as-usual urbanisation persists, social and physical vulnerability will become\nmuch more challenging to address.</td>

      <td>The benefits of actions taken to reduce GHG emissions and climate stressors diminish with delayed action, indicating the necessity\nfor rapid responses. Delaying the same actions for increasing the resilience of infrastructure from 2020 to 2030 is estimated to have\na median cost of at least USD1 trillion (Hallegatte et al. 2019) while also missing the carbon emissions reductions required in the\nnarrowing window of opportunity to limit global warming to 1.5&#176;C (WGI). In contrast, taking integrated actions towards mitigation,\nadaptation, and sustainable development will provide multiple benefits for the health and well-being of urban inhabitants and avoid\nstranded assets (see WGII Section 6.3, WGII Chapter 17, Cross-Chapter Box on &#8216;Feasibility&#8217; in WGII Chapter 18, WGIII Chapter 5, and\nWGIII Section 8.2).</td>

      <td>far beyond cities (medium evidence, high agreement) (G&#246;pfert et al. 2019; Grafakos et al. 2020). Given rapid changes in the built\nenvironment, transforming the use of materials and the land intensiveness of urban development, including in many parts of the Global\nSouth, will be critical in the next decades, as well as mainstreaming low-carbon development principles in new urban development in\nall regions. Much of this development will be self-built and &#8216;informal&#8217; &#8211; and new modes of governance and planning will be required\nto engage with this. Integrating mitigation and adaptation now rather than later, through reshaping patterns of urban development\nand associated decision-making processes, is a prerequisite for attaining resilient and zero-carbon cities (see WGIII Sections 8.4 and\n8.6, and WGIII Figure 8.21).</td>

      <td>While more cities have developed plans for climate adaptation and mitigation since AR5, many remain to be implemented (limited\nevidence, high agreement) (Araos et al. 2017; Aguiar et al. 2018; Olazabal and Ruiz De Gopegui 2021). A review of local climate\nmitigation and adaptation plans across 885 urban areas of the European Union suggests mitigation plans are more common than\nadaptation plans &#8211; and that city size, national legislation, and international networks can influence the development of local climate\nand adaptation plans with an estimated 80% of those cities with above 500,000 inhabitants having a mitigation and/or an adaptation\nplan (Reckien et al. 2018).</td>

      <td>Integrated approaches to tackle common drivers of emissions and cascading risks provide the basis for strengthening synergies across\nmitigation and adaptation, and help manage possible trade-offs with sustainable development (limited evidence, medium agreement)\n(Grafakos et al. 2019; Landauer et al. 2019; Pierer and Creutzig 2019). An analysis of 315 local authority emission-reduction plans\nreveals that the most common policies cover municipal assets and structures (Palermo et al. 2020a). Estimates of emission reductions\nby non-state and sub-state actors in 10 high-emitting economies projected GHG emissions in 2030 would be 1.2&#8211;2.0 GtCO -eq yr&#8211;1\n2\nor 3.8&#8211;5.5% lower compared to scenario projections for current national policies (31.6&#8211;36.8 GtCO -eq yr&#8211;1) if the policies are\n2\nfully implemented and do not change the pace of action elsewhere (Kuramochi et al. 2020). The value of integrating mitigation\nand adaptation is underscored in the opportunities for decarbonising existing urban areas, and investing in social, ecological, and\ntechnological infrastructure resilience (WGII Section 6.4). Integrating mitigation and adaption is challenging (Landauer et al. 2019) but\ncan provide multiple benefits for the health and well-being of urban inhabitants (Sharifi 2021) (See WGIII Section 8.2.3).</td>

      <td>Effective climate strategies combine mitigation and adaptation responses, including through linking adaptive urban land use with\nGHG emission reductions (medium evidence, high agreement) (Xu et al. 2019; Patterson 2021). For example, urban green and blue\ninfrastructure can provide co-benefits for mitigation and adaptation (&#220;rge-Vorsatz et al. 2018) and is an important entry point for\nintegrating adaptation and mitigation at the urban level (Frantzeskaki et al. 2019) (see WGIII Section 8.4.4 and WGIII Figure 8.18).\nGrey and physical infrastructure, such as sea defences, can immediately reduce risk, but also transfer risk and limit future options.\nSocial policy interventions including social safety nets provide financial security for the most at-risk and can manage vulnerability\ndetermined by specific hazards or independently.</td>
