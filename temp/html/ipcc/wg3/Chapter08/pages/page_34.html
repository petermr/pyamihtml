The key characteristics that define the IMPs involve aspects of energy, land use, lifestyle, policy, and innovation. Urban areas provide cross-cutting contexts where each of these key characteristics can be enabled and have a&#160;particularly important role in the transformation pathways for renewable energy (IMP-Ren), low demand (IMP-LD), and shifting to sustainability (IMP-SP). Pathways that are compliant with the Paris Agreement include such urban implications as a&#160;reversal of decreasing land-use efficiency in urban areas to lower energy demand based on spatial planning for compact urban form (Section&#160;8.4.2), changes in urban infrastructure for supporting demand flexibility to handle variable energy supply (Section&#160;8.4.3), as well as policies and governance that are conducive to innovation in urban areas (Section&#160;8.5). Spatial planning for compact urban form can enable reduced energy demand and changes in service provisioning, including through walkable neighbourhoods and mixed land use, providing venues for socio-behavioural change towards active transport (Section&#160;8.4.5). Electrification and sector coupling in urban infrastructure can, for instance, be an important enabler of supporting higher penetrations of renewable energy in the energy system.</span></div><div left="51.02" right="219.0" top="233.98"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 57.26; y0: 233.98; y1: 245.98; width: 6.24; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="51.02" y0="233.98" x1="219.0">8.4 Urban Mitigation Options</span></div><div left="51.02" right="299.04" top="210.6"><span style="x0: 51.02; x1: 56.65; y0: 210.6; y1: 220.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="51.02" y0="210.6" x1="299.04">Urban mitigation options can be categorised into three broad strategies: (i) reducing or changing urban energy and material use towards more sustainable production and consumption across all sectors, including through spatial planning and infrastructure; (ii)&#160;electrification and switching to net-zero-emissions resources; and (iii) enhancing carbon storage in the urban environment through urban green and blue infrastructure, which can also offer multiple co-benefits. A&#160;fourth, socio-behavioural aspects, can shift energy demand and emerge as the result of implementing the strategies. Urban mitigation options covered in this section are organised around these three strategies and can facilitate deep decarbonisation through systemic transformation (see Section&#160;8.6 and Figure&#160;8.21 for prioritising mitigation options based on urban form and urban growth typologies).</span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.62" top="726.62"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 315.17; y0: 726.62; y1: 736.12; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="726.62" x1="557.62">Urban areas are systems where multiple mitigation options&#160;&#8211; especially when integrated&#160;&#8211; have cascading effects across transport, energy, buildings, land use, and behaviour. These cascading effects take place both within and across urban systems (Figure&#160;8.15). Mitigation actions also occur at multiple urban scales, from households and blocks to districts and city regions, and can be implemented as standalone sectoral strategies, such as increasing energy efficiency for appliances, and also as system-wide actions. In reducing emissions locally, urban areas can help lower emissions outside of their administrative boundaries through their use of materials and resources, and by increasing the efficiency of infrastructure and energy use beyond what is possible with individual sectoral strategies. Urban mitigation policies that implement multiple integrated interventions will provide more emissions savings than the sum of individual interventions (Sethi et al. 2020).</span></div><div left="309.55" right="557.61" top="534.65"><span style="x0: 309.55; x1: 311.85; y0: 534.65; y1: 544.15; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.55" y0="534.65" x1="557.61">Integrated action also has a&#160;key role in providing benefits for human well-being. Urban mitigation options and strategies that are effective, efficient, and fair can also support broader sustainability goals (G&#252;neralp et al. 2017; Kona et al. 2018; Pasimeni et al. 2019). Due to the complex and intensive interactions in urban systems and the interlinked nature of the SDGs, cities can be important intervention points to harness synergies and co-benefits for achieving emissions reductions along with other SDGs (Nilsson et al. 2016; Corbett and Mellouli 2017) (Section&#160;8.2 and Figure&#160;8.4).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="451.52" top="402.48"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.74; y0: 402.48; y1: 412.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="309.54" y0="402.48" x1="451.52">8.4.1 Avoiding Carbon Lock-in</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.6" top="378.6"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 314.64; y0: 378.6; y1: 388.1; width: 5.1; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="378.6" x1="557.6">Carbon lock-in occurs as the result of interactions between different geographic and administrative scales (institutional lock-in) and across sectors (infrastructural and technological lock-in), which create the conditions for behavioural lock-in covering both individual and social structural behaviours (Seto et al. 2016) (see Glossary for a&#160;broader definition of &#8216;lock-in&#8217;). The way that urban areas are designed, laid out, and built (i.e.,&#160;urban form) affects and is affected by the interactions across the different forms of carbon lock-in (Figures&#160;8.15 and 8.16). Cities are especially prone to carbon lock-in because of the multiple interactions of technological, institutional, and behavioural systems, which create inertia and path dependency that are difficult to break. For example, the lock-in of gasoline cars is reinforced by highway and energy infrastructures that are further locked-in by social and cultural preferences for individual mobility options. The dominance of cars and their supporting infrastructures in auto-centric urban forms is further reinforced by zoning and urban development patterns, such as dispersed and low-density housing distantly located from jobs, that create obstacles to creating alternative mobility options (Seto et al. 2016; Linton et al. 2021).</span></div><div left="309.54" right="557.6" top="126.63"><span style="x0: 309.54; x1: 315.17; y0: 126.63; y1: 136.13; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="309.54" y0="126.63" x1="557.6">Urban infrastructures and the built environment are long-lived assets, embodying triple carbon lock-ins in terms of their construction, operations, and demolition (Creutzig et al. 2016b; Seto et al. 2016; &#220;rge-Vorsatz et al. 2018).
