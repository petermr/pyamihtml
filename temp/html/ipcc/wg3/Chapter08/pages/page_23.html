From 1975 to 2015, urban settlements expanded in size approximately 2.5 times, accounting for 7.6% of the global land area (Pesaresi et al. 2016). Nearly 70% of the total urban expansion between 1992 and&#160;2015 occurred in Asia and North America (Liu et al. 2020a). By 2015, the extent of urban and built-up lands was between 0.5% and 0.6% of the total 130 Mkm</span><span style="x0: 154.48; x1: 157.67; y0: 658.64; y1: 665.29; width: 3.19; font-size: 6.65; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="154.48" y0="658.64" x1="157.67">2</span><span style="x0: 159.86; x1: 164.43; y0: 654.6; y1: 664.1; width: 4.57; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="159.86" y0="654.6" x1="304.75">global ice-free land use, taking up other uses such as fertile cropland and natural ecosystems.</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="618.61"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 618.61; y1: 628.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="618.61" x1="304.75">Second, as Figure&#160;8.5 shows, urban population densities are declining, with significant implications for GHG emissions. From 1970 to 2010, while the global urban settlement extent doubled in size (Pesaresi et al. 2016), most regions (grouped by the AR6 WGIII 10-region aggregation) exhibited a&#160;trend of decreasing urban population densities, suggesting expansive urban growth patterns. Urban population densities have consistently declined in Australia, Japan and New Zealand, and Europe, North America, and Southern Asia regions, across all city sizes. North America consistently had the lowest urban population densities. Notably, the Middle East region appears to be the only region exhibiting an overall increasing trend across all city-size groups, while Latin America and Caribbean </span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.27" top="726.62"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.62; y0: 726.62; y1: 736.12; width: 4.4; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="726.62" x1="563.27">appears to be relatively stable for all city sizes. While the larger cities in Africa and South-East Asia and Pacific exhibit slightly stable urban population densities, the small and medium-sized cities in those regions trend toward lower urban population densities. In large urban centres of Eastern Asia and North America, rapid decreases in earlier decades seem to have tapered. Compared to larger cities, small-medium urban areas with populations of less than 2&#160;million have more declines in urban population densities and higher rates of urban land expansion (G&#252;neralp et al. 2020).</span></div><div left="315.22" right="563.27" top="606.64"><span style="x0: 315.22; x1: 319.44; y0: 606.64; y1: 616.14; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.22" y0="606.64" x1="563.27">This decline in urban densities is paralleled by an increase in &#8216;sprawl&#8217;, or &#8216;outward&#8217; urban development. Urban expansion occurs in either one of three dimensions: (i) outward in a&#160;horizontal manner; (ii) upward, by way of vertical growth; or (iii) infill development, where unused, abandoned, or underutilised lands within existing urban areas are developed or rehabilitated (Figure&#160;8.20). Outward expansion results in more urban land area and occurs at the expense of other land uses (i.e.,&#160;the conversion and loss of cropland or forests). Vertical expansion results in more multi-storey buildings and taller buildings, more floor space per area, and an increase in urban built-up density. Every city has some combination of outward and upward </span></div><div left="57.0" right="518.76" top="102.48"><span style="x0: 57.0; x1: 60.7; y0: 102.48; y1: 110.48; width: 3.7; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="57.0" y0="102.48" x1="518.76">Figure&#160;8.7:&#160;Percent of total urban land expansion from other land covers, sorted by the AR6 WGIII 10-region aggregation (1970&#8211;2010). </span><span style="x0: 519.34; x1: 523.78; y0: 102.48; y1: 110.48; width: 4.45; font-size: 8.0; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-LightCn;" x0="519.34" y0="102.48" x1="562.9">As urban land has expanded outward, other forms of land cover, including agriculture, &#8216;nature&#8217; (e.g.,&#160;forest, grassland, shrubland, water, and bare soil, all of which are disaggregated to the bottom half of the plot), and other land covers, have been displaced. Globally, agriculture comprises the majority (about 60%) of the land displaced by urban expansion since 1970. Forests and shrubland vegetation&#160;&#8211; important carbon stocks&#160;&#8211; also make up a&#160;significant proportion of displacement. The loss of carbon-sequestering land like forests and shrubland independently impacts climate change by reducing global carbon stocks. Eurasia is omitted because there are no case studies from that region that report land conversion data. Source: adapted from G&#252;neralp et al. (2020).</span></div></body></html>
