First, urbanisation will increase in speed and magnitude. Given their significant impact on emissions, mitigation action in Asian cities, especially the large and rapidly growing cities, will have significant implications on global ambitions (Section&#160;8.3.4).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="594.61"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 594.61; y1: 604.11; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="594.61" x1="304.76">Second, a&#160;number of cities in developing countries lack institutional, financial and technical capacities to enable local climate change action (Sharifi et al. 2017; Fuhr et al. 2018). While these capacities differ across contexts (Hickmann et al. 2017), several governance challenges are similar across cities (Gouldson et al. 2015). These factors also influence the ability of cities to innovate and effectively implement mitigation action (Nagendra et al. 2018) (Chapter&#160;17).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.72" top="498.63"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.91; y0: 498.63; y1: 508.13; width: 4.22; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="498.63" x1="304.72">Third, there are sizable economic benefits in developing country cities that can provide an opportunity to enhance political momentum and institutions (Colenbrander et al. 2016). The co-benefits approach (Section&#160;8.2), which frames climate objectives alongside other development benefits, is increasingly seen as an important concept justifying and driving climate change action in developing countries (Sethi and Puppim de Oliveira 2018).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.75" top="402.64"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 60.56; y0: 402.64; y1: 412.14; width: 3.87; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="402.64" x1="304.75">Large-scale system transformations are also deeply influenced by factors outside governance and institutions, such as private interests and power dynamics (Jaglin 2014; Tyfield 2014). In some cases, these private interests are tied up with international flows of capital. In India, adaptation plans involving networks of private actors and related mitigation actions have resulted in the dominance of private interests. This has led to trade-offs and adverse impacts on the poor (Chu 2016; Mehta et al. 2019).</span></div><div left="56.69" right="304.76" top="294.65"><span style="x0: 56.69; x1: 64.25; y0: 294.65; y1: 304.15; width: 7.56; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="56.69" y0="294.65" x1="304.76">When planning and implementing low-carbon transitions, it is important to consider the socio-economic context. An inclusive approach emphasises the need to engage non-state actors, including businesses, research organisations, non-profit organisations and citizens (Lee and Painter 2015; Hale et al. 2020). For example, engaging people in defining locally relevant mitigation targets and actions has enabled successful transformations in China (Engels 2018), Africa (G&#246;pfert et al. 2019) and Malaysia (Ho et al. 2015). An active research and government collaboration through multiple stakeholder interactions in a&#160;large economic corridor in Malaysia led to the development and implementation of a&#160;low-carbon blueprint for the region (Ho et al. 2013). Many cities in LDCs and developing countries lack adequate urban infrastructure and housing. An equitable transformation in these cities entails prioritising energy access and basic services, including safe drinking water and sanitation, to meet basic needs of their populations.</span></div><div left="315.21" right="454.14" top="726.48"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.41; y0: 726.48; y1: 736.48; width: 5.2; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-BoldCn;" x0="315.21" y0="726.48" x1="454.14">8.1.6 Urban Carbon Footprint</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="702.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.84; y0: 702.6; y1: 712.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="702.6" x1="563.28">Urban areas concentrate GHG fluxes because of the size of the urban population, the size and nature of the urban economy, the energy and GHGs embodied in the infrastructure (see &#8216;embodied emissions&#8217; in Glossary), and the goods and services imported and exported to and from cities (USGCRP 2018).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="430.24" top="630.48"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.01; y0: 630.48; y1: 640.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="630.48" x1="430.24">8.1.6.1 Urban Carbon Cycle</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="606.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 317.51; y0: 606.6; y1: 616.1; width: 2.3; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="606.6" x1="563.28">In cities, carbon cycles through natural (e.g.,&#160;vegetation and soils) and managed (e.g.,&#160;reservoirs and anthropogenic&#160;&#8211; buildings, transportation) pools. The accumulation of carbon in urban pools, such as buildings or landfills, results from the local or global transfer of carbon-containing energy and raw materials used in the city (Churkina 2008; Pichler et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2020b). Quantitative understanding of these transfers and the resulting emissions and uptake within an urban area is essential for accurate urban carbon accounting (USGCRP 2018). Currently, urban areas are a&#160;net source of carbon because they emit more carbon than they uptake. Thus, urban mitigation strategies require a&#160;twofold strategy: reducing urban emissions of carbon into the atmosphere, and enhancing uptake of&#160;carbon in urban pools (Churkina 2012) (for a&#160;broader definition of &#8216;carbon cycle&#8217; and related terms such as &#8216;carbon sink,&#8217; &#8216;carbon stock,&#8217; &#8216;carbon neutrality,&#8217; &#8216;GHG neutrality,&#8217; and others, see Glossary).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.25" top="414.63"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.14; y0: 414.63; y1: 424.13; width: 4.93; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="414.63" x1="563.25">Burning fossil fuels to generate energy for buildings, transportation, industry, and other sectors is a&#160;major source of urban GHG emissions (Gurney et al. 2015). At the same time, most cities do not generate within their boundaries all of the resources they use, such as electricity, gasoline, cement, water, and food needed for local homes and businesses to function (Jacobs 1969), requiring consideration of GHG emissions embodied in supply chains serving cities. Furthermore, urban vegetation, soils, and aquatic systems can both emit or remove carbon from the urban atmosphere and are often heavily managed. For example, urban parks, forests, and street trees actively remove carbon from the atmosphere through growing season photosynthesis. They can become a&#160;net source of carbon most often during the dormant season or heat waves. Some of the sequestered carbon can be stored in the biomass of urban trees, soils, and aquatic systems. Urban infrastructures containing cement also uptake carbon through the process of carbonation. The uptake of carbon by urban trees is at least two orders of magnitude faster than by cement-containing infrastructures (Churkina 2012) (Section&#160;8.4.4 and Figures&#160;8.17 and 8.18).</span></div><div left="315.21" right="462.11" top="174.48"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.01; y0: 174.48; y1: 184.48; width: 4.8; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0.339]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="174.48" x1="462.11">8.1.6.2 Urban Emissions Accounting</span></div><div left="315.21" right="563.28" top="150.6"><span style="x0: 315.21; x1: 320.84; y0: 150.6; y1: 160.1; width: 5.62; font-size: 9.5; fill: [0]; font-family: HPFPTY+FrutigerLTPro-Condensed;" x0="315.21" y0="150.6" x1="563.28">Urban GHG emissions accounting can determine critical conceptual and quantitative aspects of urban GHG emissions.
