Human flourishing is the optimal continuing development of human beings&#8217; potential and living well as human beings. This means being engaged in relationships and activities that are meaningful, that is, aligned with both human beings&#8217; own values and humanistic values, in a way that is satisfying to them. Flourishing is conditional on the contribution of individuals and requires an enabling environment.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="349.73" top="318.69"><span x0="214.0" y0="318.69" x1="349.73" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.5; y0: 318.69; y1: 329.69; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">2. Flourishing is malleable. The extent to which newborns will grow into flourishing adults depends on the experiences to which they are exposed and those which they initiate. Beyond what nature endows us with and the specific conditions into which we are born, how we are nurtured can substantially impact flourishing.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="353.84" top="168.7"><span x0="214.0" y0="168.7" x1="353.84" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.5; y0: 168.7; y1: 179.7; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">3. Education and flourishing are intertwined. We posit flourishing as both the aim and means of education. Hence, both the future orientation of education and the context in which learning is advanced are to be viewed through the lens of flourishing.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="487.8" top="508.3"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.3" x1="487.8" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 508.3; y1: 519.3; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">4. Flourishing depends on multiple factors; broadly, it includes both individual potential, and external conditions and influences (i.e. context &#8210; local, global, economic, ecological).</span></div><div left="374.0" right="512.07" top="411.1"><span x0="374.0" y0="411.1" x1="512.07" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 411.1; y1: 422.1; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">5. Education can be framed as a broad system of relationships (e.g. teacher&#8210;student, self&#8210;other, self&#8210; self, self&#8210;society, self&#8210;ecology).</span></div><div left="374.0" right="481.76" top="340.31"><span x0="374.0" y0="340.31" x1="481.76" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 340.31; y1: 351.31; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">6. Given that flourishing is multifaceted, there is a need to inform education in and for flourishing through multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives, building on existing educational theory and practice and scientific findings that are viewed in the context of global and local challenges.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="494.62" top="177.11"><span x0="374.0" y0="177.11" x1="494.62" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 380.65; y0: 177.11; y1: 188.11; width: 6.65; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Building on these ideas that have emerged from previous chapters, we point to an additional perspective that seems necessary for proposing concrete directions for education in flourishing; that of education as a complex system.</span></div><div left="54.0" right="128.66" top="602.01"><span x0="54.0" y0="602.01" x1="128.66" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 61.09; y0: 602.01; y1: 614.01; width: 7.09; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: JLNIGU+Knockout-HTF31-JuniorMiddlewt;">CHAPTER</span></div><div left="88.04" right="96.49" top="634.86"><span x0="88.04" y0="634.86" x1="96.49" style="x0: 88.04; x1: 96.49; y0: 634.86; y1: 646.86; width: 8.45; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TrendSlabFour;">4</span></div><div left="54.0" right="149.93" top="506.91"><span x0="54.0" y0="506.91" x1="149.93" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 62.55; y0: 506.91; y1: 520.91; width: 8.55; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.985, 0.731, 0.026]; font-family: JLNIGU+TradeGothicLTStd;">Education and flourishing areintertwined.
