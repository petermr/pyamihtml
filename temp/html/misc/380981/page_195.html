Acknowledging the premise of education as a dynamic system implies that while we seek to do our best in directing education in flourishing, we must remain aware of the outcomes of our practice. We should continue to improve learning based on insights that potentially gain more credibility with time yet remain somewhat conjectural.</span></div><div left="214.13" right="345.35" top="306.08"><span x0="214.13" y0="306.08" x1="345.35" style="x0: 214.13; x1: 220.26; y0: 306.08; y1: 317.08; width: 6.14; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0.5]; font-family: KFZNXS+AGaramondPro-BoldItalic;">Flourishing aims (potentials) and manifestations (enactments):</span><span x0="214.13" y0="279.09" x1="344.31" style="x0: 214.13; x1: 225.84; y0: 279.09; y1: 290.09; width: 11.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The expected end result of the curriculum and teaching is the development of capacities, propensities and capabilities that contribute to the flourishing of the individual and that of others. Education should provide individuals with a range of mental, physical and practical capacities and capabilities that increase their ability to choose and follow their own path towards a flourishing life. Education should also develop the propensity to act on these spontaneously, by will or as an acquired habit.

Education, however, should also go beyond the flourishing of each particular individual. It should bring individuals to contribute to flourishing in broader interpersonal circles (e.g. through acts of caring). Each individual has the power to affect not only their own flourishing but that of others and education should guide individuals to promote the flourishing of others around them. In addition, education should encourage individuals to contribute to the creation, maintenance and enhancement of the conditions that facilitate flourishing (e.g. environmental, political, economic, cultural).  </span></div><div left="374.12" right="512.36" top="213.09"><span x0="374.12" y0="213.09" x1="512.36" style="x0: 374.12; x1: 380.78; y0: 213.09; y1: 224.09; width: 6.65; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Based on this first framework of education in and for flourishing, we focus on a framework for curriculum followed by its relation to learning.
