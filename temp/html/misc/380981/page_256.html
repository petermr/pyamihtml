In the following section, we highlight the importance of relationships at three intertwined levels: 1) relationships with ourselves (or intrapersonal relationships); 2) relationships with other people (or interpersonal relationships); and 3) relationships to knowledge, subject matter or curriculum content. These three relationship levels dovetail with those discussed in </span><span style="x0: 225.35; x1: 232.02; y0: 311.82; y1: 321.82; width: 6.67; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="225.35" y0="311.82" x1="258.11">Wg1-ch4</span><span x0="258.11" y0="310.29" x1="315.29" style="x0: 258.11; x1: 260.86; y0: 310.29; y1: 321.29; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.

Our &#8216;Relationships with Others&#8217; and &#8216;Relationships with Ourselves&#8217; align perfectly with their fifth and sixth domains respectively. However, we have collapsed their first four curricular domains (environment, culture, science and technology) and we deal with these together under &#8216;Relationship to Curriculum Knowledge&#8217;. In doing so, we do not suggest each element is unimportant in its own right; however, we are </span></div><div left="374.0" right="521.83" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="521.83" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 376.82; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 2.83; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">interested in exploring curriculum domains in a more holistic way. We seek to explore the nature of students&#8217; relationships with subject knowledge broadly, in ways that can be applied across subject areas. By emphasizing three relationship levels, we argue that education for 2030 and beyond cannot just be about maximizing individual cognitive potential, or about imparting the technical know-how to be successful in the labour market. At the school level, education for human flourishing needs to foster a range of additional capacities, such as the capacity to tune in to one&#8217;s own emotions, thoughts and feelings, to develop compassion for self and others, to understand another person&#8217;s perspective, to resolve conflicts peacefully, to engage critically with subject matter and for ethically informed decisions and actions to improve individual and collective flourishing. These capacities are crucial for supporting students to respond to the question of how human beings can live well together on the planet with its finite resources.</span></div><div left="52.58" right="127.25" top="602.01"><span x0="52.58" y0="602.01" x1="127.25" style="x0: 52.58; x1: 59.67; y0: 602.01; y1: 614.01; width: 7.09; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: JLNIGU+Knockout-HTF31-JuniorMiddlewt;">CHAPTER</span></div><div left="86.84" right="94.85" top="634.86"><span x0="86.84" y0="634.86" x1="94.85" style="x0: 86.84; x1: 94.85; y0: 634.86; y1: 646.86; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TrendSlabFour;">5</span></div><div left="54.36" right="176.02" top="506.91"><span x0="54.36" y0="506.91" x1="176.02" style="x0: 54.36; x1: 58.63; y0: 506.91; y1: 520.91; width: 4.27; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.985, 0.731, 0.026]; font-family: JLNIGU+TradeGothicLTStd;">... schools seeking to promote human flourishing need to place relationships at their centre.</span></div></body></html>
