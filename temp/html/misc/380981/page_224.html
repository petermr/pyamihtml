It is increasingly recognized that education can make a substantial contribution to adopting a healthier lifestyle, which is central to flourishing. The contribution of education can range from bringing students to engage in physical activity and keeping a more balanced diet to how to lower the risk of infection during a pandemic.       </span></div><div left="214.0" right="363.94" top="199.53"><span style="x0: 214.0; x1: 223.0; y0: 199.53; y1: 217.53; width: 9.0; font-size: 18.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="214.0" y0="199.53" x1="363.94">cRitical aSSeSSment oF the cuRRiculaR FRameWoRK</span></div><div left="214.0" right="357.5" top="124.69"><span x0="214.0" y0="124.69" x1="357.5" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 220.85; y0: 124.69; y1: 135.69; width: 6.85; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">At least two critical issues emerge as we consider the elaboration of the curricular framework aimed at flourishing:</span></div><div left="374.0" right="487.3" top="508.66"><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 380.0; y0: 508.66; y1: 520.66; width: 6.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.586, 0.108, 0.504]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="508.66" x1="487.3">cuRRiculaR domainS aS ReductioniStic</span></div><div left="374.0" right="494.43" top="462.0"><span x0="374.0" y0="462.0" x1="494.43" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 385.71; y0: 462.0; y1: 473.0; width: 11.71; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The demarcation of discrete curricular domains aims to facilitate the development of a curriculum that intends to promote flourishing.

To counter this, firstly, we reiterate the need to think of the curricular domains in light of Bronfenbrenner&#8217;s ecological model, in which domains interact with each other and, in light of complexity theory, which views education as webs of interconnected and mutually influencing elements. The breaking of the curriculum into domains, then, aims to aid the conceptualization of education for flourishing and is not supposed to reflect existing rigid divisions. Secondly, we briefly demonstrate how an engagement with one curricular domain easily intersects with other domains to a point where interrelations between them arise and ameliorate the siloed </span></div><div left="219.33" right="248.63" top="235.76"><span style="x0: 219.33; x1: 227.32; y0: 235.76; y1: 253.76; width: 7.99; font-size: 18.0; fill: [1, 1, 1]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="219.33" y0="235.76" x1="248.63">4.2 .2</span></div><div left="54.0" right="128.66" top="602.01"><span x0="54.0" y0="602.01" x1="128.66" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 61.09; y0: 602.01; y1: 614.01; width: 7.09; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: JLNIGU+Knockout-HTF31-JuniorMiddlewt;">CHAPTER</span></div><div left="88.04" right="96.49" top="634.86"><span x0="88.04" y0="634.86" x1="96.49" style="x0: 88.04; x1: 96.49; y0: 634.86; y1: 646.86; width: 8.45; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TrendSlabFour;">4</span></div></body></html>
