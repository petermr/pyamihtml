So far we have described what human flourishing means, that is, which conditions need to be fulfilled in order to be able to say that humans are flourishing; the so-called constitutive elements or constituents. But human flourishing also presumes that basic conditions are fulfilled. These include basic biological needs like food and safety or existential needs like freedom or psychological health. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="321.12" top="154.87"><span x0="214.0" y0="154.87" x1="321.12" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 220.04; y0: 154.87; y1: 165.87; width: 6.04; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Preconditions tend to be categorized as internal or external.

Firstly, within the context of humans, particularly in individualist cultures, internal conditions are often construed as those within the body boundary, with anything outside deemed as external, which may include social (or cultural) and physical environments. Secondly, some may construe internal preconditions more narrowly, that is, by referring to phenomenological or subjective fields of experience or the &#8216;I&#8217; as internal, and hence things within the body boundary such as brain chemistry as external. Thirdly, Aristotle used &#8216;external&#8217; in a wider sense, namely for all those conditions that are necessary for human flourishing, but that are largely beyond the agent&#8217;s control </span><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 376.78; y0: 219.42; y1: 229.42; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="219.42" x1="454.5">(aristotle, 2009, p. 14)</span><span x0="454.5" y0="217.89" x1="518.1" style="x0: 454.5; x1: 457.25; y0: 217.89; y1: 228.89; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">, which means that human beings also require (a bit of) luck to be able to flourish.
