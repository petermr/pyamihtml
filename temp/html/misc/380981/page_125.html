On the basis of our description of flourishing and education, as well as their relation, we propose that the following five recommendations are taken into account in policy-making: </span></div><div left="214.0" right="339.76" top="421.87"><span x0="214.0" y0="421.87" x1="339.76" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.5; y0: 421.87; y1: 432.87; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">1. The concept of flourishing is a complex (multifactorial) one with various meanings. We suggest that the proposed meaning is used (not only in the ISEE Assessment, but also in other UNESCO documents), for it is comprehensive and culturally neutral. This means that, in principle, it is possible for all governments, school leaders, teachers, parents and pupils to use it. In addition, it is agent-relative, which ensures that the particular characteristics of each human being are taken into account</span></div><div left="214.0" right="332.62" top="190.67"><span x0="214.0" y0="190.67" x1="332.62" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.5; y0: 190.67; y1: 201.67; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">2. Education should not be understood as a system or an institution, but rather as three central types of activity on the part of teachers and pupils, namely teaching, learning and evaluating, each of which expresses a particular relationship between the actors involved. </span></div><div left="374.0" right="520.4" top="532.27"><span x0="374.0" y0="532.27" x1="520.4" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 532.27; y1: 543.27; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">3. Education is to be the favoured concept over learning as it ensures that not only are the how and what questions asked (what should pupils learn and how do they learn most effectively; or what should teachers teach and which is the most effective way to do so), but also the why question. The question regarding the purpose of education should be the primary one and answers to it will inform the other two questions.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="514.53" top="342.67"><span x0="374.0" y0="342.67" x1="514.53" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 342.67; y1: 353.67; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">4. Flourishing and education are to be understood as forms for iterative/reciprocal action. It is not just that human flourishing and education stand in relation with one another. Also, human relations are guided by doing things together (association) in the pursuit of understanding, well-being and thriving (flourishing). </span></div><div left="374.0" right="521.33" top="192.68"><span x0="374.0" y0="192.68" x1="521.33" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 192.68; y1: 203.68; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">5. The purpose of education is the flourishing of human beings; thus it is not focused on the flourishing of an individual pupil, but takes into account the flourishing of all.individual pupil, but takes into account the flourishing of all.</span></div></body></html>
