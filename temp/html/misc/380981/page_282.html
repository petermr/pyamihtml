Given the complex and interrelated nature of the development of this biopsychosocial organism that is a human being, it is to be expected that no single approach holds all the answers. In this section, we review approaches that address multiple dimensions of children&#8217;s growth, with particular attention to social emotional capacities. These skills are sometimes referred to as non-academic or co-cognitive skills. We prefer the latter and will use the term co-cognitive where relevant, because these skills are inextricably linked to the process and outcomes of learning </span><span style="x0: 321.72; x1: 324.5; y0: 219.42; y1: 229.42; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="321.72" y0="219.42" x1="359.24">(Wg3-ch4)</span><span x0="359.14" y0="217.89" x1="364.64" style="x0: 359.14; x1: 361.89; y0: 217.89; y1: 228.89; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="339.0" top="186.69"><span x0="214.0" y0="186.69" x1="339.0" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.37; y0: 186.69; y1: 197.69; width: 5.38; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">SEL offers a powerful tool to promote flourishing in education.

SEL is taught in a variety of ways, including through explicit instruction, teacher modelling of behaviour and skills, and integration with academic subjects. According to a landmark meta-analysis that aggregated findings across 213 studies of universal schoolbased SEL programmes involving over 270,000 K-12 students, SEL instruction is most effective when taught by the classroom teacher and programme activities are sequenced, active, focused on social or personal skills and explicit in targeting SEL rather than general positive development </span><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 376.78; y0: 233.82; y1: 243.82; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="233.82" x1="507.8">(following the acronym SaFe; durlak et al., 2011)</span><span x0="417.3" y0="219.09" x1="498.92" style="x0: 417.3; x1: 420.05; y0: 219.09; y1: 230.09; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.
