Some are in a situation whereby they can only contribute to the flourishing of people close by, while others have the means and the opportunity to help large groups of people or people further removed to flourish. This is not based on the view that flourishing people are naturally inclined to act morally or that they always act morally (although they will feel ashamed or guilty if they have done something immoral) or that they do not have to overcome other desires and negative emotions. There are ample empirical illustrations that such presumptions are not true. They do, however, point to the importance of education in which these humanistic values are fostered. In this way, flourishing and education seem to be intertwined on the basis of shared moral values. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="273.76" top="133.75"><span style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.33; y0: 133.75; y1: 145.75; width: 5.33; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.504]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="214.0" y0="133.75" x1="273.76">SatiSFaction</span></div><div left="214.0" right="340.34" top="101.49"><span x0="214.0" y0="101.49" x1="340.34" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 220.04; y0: 101.49; y1: 112.49; width: 6.04; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">People can be said to flourish when they enact their potential </span></div><div left="374.0" right="493.59" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="493.59" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 376.82; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 2.83; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">irrespective of whether they affirm that they are doing so or whether they are satisfied with the way in which they are able to lead their life. This, however, does not seem to cohere with our common understanding of human flourishing. It seems incorrect to say that someone flourishes if they do not share that evaluation or if they are unhappy with their life (which could be a clinical depression, but also a &#8216;healthy evaluation&#8217; of what their life turns out to be). Therefore the description includes a subjective evaluative dimension of flourishing. </span></div><div left="374.0" right="513.04" top="252.69"><span x0="374.0" y0="252.69" x1="513.04" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.37; y0: 252.69; y1: 263.69; width: 5.38; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Satisfaction has both a cognitive valuative and emotional dimension. Human beings flourish if they: a) can (authentically) affirm that their life is good, that is, they have reasons for giving a positive evaluation; b) have overall positive feelings about their life (they are happy), which does not mean that they have to have these positive feelings all the time or about everything they do.</span></div></body></html>
