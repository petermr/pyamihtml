In this way, one&#8217;s flourishing seems to be intertwined with one&#8217;s education on the basis that both actions, that is, flourishing and education, are inextricably connected with the idea of a human relation. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="333.61" top="345.09"><span x0="214.0" y0="345.09" x1="333.61" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.92; y0: 345.09; y1: 356.09; width: 5.92; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Figure 1 shows how human flourishing and education  are intertwined (mutually reinforcing). Firstly, education enables flourishing &#8211; human beings need to be introduced into the social, cultural and natural world by teaching and learning, in relation to teachers and the environment, for they need to be able to make sense of their world in order to be able to live well as human beings. This means that flourishing can be regarded as an aim of education. Secondly, flourishing enhances education &#8211; when teachers and students flourish in their teaching and learning, in other words when they can develop their potential and live well and when teaching </span></div><div left="374.0" right="507.42" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="507.42" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 378.44; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 4.44; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">and learning are meaningful to them, their relations will prosper and both the teaching and learning will be higher in quality.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="497.26" top="437.49"><span x0="374.0" y0="437.49" x1="497.26" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 385.71; y0: 437.49; y1: 448.49; width: 11.71; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The intertwined character of flourishing and education also shows that flourishing is a hybrid concept: the development of human potential that makes life a human life must inform education (the naturalistic quality of flourishing), but the worlds in which these potentials are fostered are different (culturally dependent) and good education takes into account that children can develop different ways of living well related to their specific potentials and their ideas and preferences about how they want to live in the world (agent-relative). That the last is true can be shown by the fact that for some adults being a teacher is a meaningful way of living well, while others want to use the potentials that teachers need to become an engineer, a doctor or a parent (and there are also human beings who do not have the specific potential to become a good teacher).</span></div><div left="54.0" right="193.12" top="505.94"><span x0="54.0" y0="505.94" x1="193.12" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 61.78; y0: 505.94; y1: 519.94; width: 7.78; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0.985, 0.731, 0.026]; font-family: JLNIGU+TradeGothicLTStd;">Flourishing enhances education &#8211; when teachers and students flourish in their teaching and learning, in other words when they can develop their potential and live well and when teaching and learning are meaningful to them, their relations will prosper and both the teaching and learning will be higher in quality.</span></div></body></html>
