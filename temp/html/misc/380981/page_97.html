The human organism differs from other life forms in many ways, but one important aspect is self- consciousness and associated self-expression. Human flourishing, in addition to its dependence on these two systemic aspects, may emerge when an individual expresses that self, authentically, as an independent, autonomous entity &#8211; in other words, when they own and are responsible for their actions. All three conditions need to be exhibited, more or less continuously, over a period of time for flourishing to emerge. In this ecological sense, it is not a momentary phenomenon.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="325.98" top="177.93"><span style="x0: 214.0; x1: 223.0; y0: 177.93; y1: 195.93; width: 9.0; font-size: 18.0; fill: [0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="214.0" y0="177.93" x1="325.98">deScRiPtion oF human FlouRiShing</span></div><div left="214.0" right="341.94" top="131.09"><span x0="214.0" y0="131.09" x1="341.94" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 225.72; y0: 131.09; y1: 142.09; width: 11.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The interpretations of human flourishing found in the various </span></div><div left="374.0" right="459.88" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="459.88" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 378.44; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 4.44; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">academic disciplines</span><span x0="459.89" y0="513.58" x1="463.09" style="x0: 459.89; x1: 463.09; y0: 513.58; y1: 519.99; width: 3.21; font-size: 6.41; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">5</span><span x0="465.84" y0="508.29" x1="487.74" style="x0: 465.84; x1: 471.51; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 5.67; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">have informed us in developing a description of human flourishing that is both comprehensive and general in character: it does not favour a particular theory of flourishing and avoids using words that are associated with particular theories. Moreover the description is formal, allowing for various interpretations of the central elements of the description (possibly informed by a particular worldview). And, as has been alluded to above, framing human flourishing in the context of an interpretive-critical perspective allows us to foreground some of its constitutive meanings as well as possibilities for human actions, including social change, human self-empowerment and liberation.
