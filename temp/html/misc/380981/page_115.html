Evaluation would not count as evaluation if reasonable judgements were not proffered about what constitutes teaching and learning, and if such judgements were not determined in deliberative action. To evaluate as teachers do, and to be evaluated as students are, does not happen in isolation but rather, in a way that both teachers and students can justify. When teachers justify their evaluation of students&#8217; work, they give an account of why students produce work of a specific kind, that is, they provide a justification for their evaluation.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="339.64" top="265.89"><span x0="214.0" y0="265.89" x1="339.64" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 220.08; y0: 265.89; y1: 276.89; width: 6.08; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Like education, teaching and learning involve human relations.

Self and collective fulfilment (flourishing) would be wanting if teachers and students did not act freely and rationally driven by a desire to honour and respect one another in their relations. In this way, human flourishing also seems to be related to the self doing things collaboratively with others so that together the selves undergo an alteration. In other words, teachers and students act in the interests of one another &#8211; a matter of being responsive to one another &#8211; when they recognize one another&#8217;s presence as speaking beings capable of making judgements about that </span></div><div left="54.0" right="188.79" top="508.22"><span x0="54.0" y0="508.22" x1="188.79" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 58.66; y0: 508.22; y1: 522.22; width: 4.66; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0.985, 0.731, 0.026]; font-family: JLNIGU+TradeGothicLTStd;">In sum, education is constituted by the act of a human relation.</span></div></body></html>
