When considering the example of a classroom, the personal and interpersonal domains constantly introduce content into the planned curriculum (e.g. student inner thoughts, relationships between students as they communicate among themselves within a lesson). This content can be related or unrelated to the intended curriculum; regardless, it can yield unintended learning experiences (for better and for worse). Bundling the learning trajectories accounts for these dynamic processes, the fluidity of the learning experience and its less expected and planned outcomes.</span></div><div left="373.99" right="499.43" top="508.29"><span x0="373.99" y0="508.29" x1="499.43" style="x0: 373.99; x1: 379.91; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 5.92; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Following various trends and changes since the Delors Report </span><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 376.78; y0: 484.62; y1: 494.62; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="484.62" x1="521.69">(international commission on education for the twenty-first century, 1996)</span><span x0="498.02" y0="469.89" x1="517.82" style="x0: 498.02; x1: 500.77; y0: 469.89; y1: 480.89; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">, we have shifted focus from learning to know, to do, to be and to live together, to learning to know and think, learning to do and evaluate, learning to learn, learning to live together, learning to live with nature and learning to be and become.
