While there are various and often contradicting interpretations of what makes a person flourish, few challenge the idea that flourishing is a worthy objective. Even educational policy that focuses on human capital and service to the state can be directly linked to flourishing. It assumes that either economic well-being and economic growth or a strong state are instrumental in achieving a flourishing life.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="329.3" top="279.09"><span x0="214.0" y0="279.09" x1="329.3" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 220.85; y0: 279.09; y1: 290.09; width: 6.85; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Although flourishing as an educational aim has been debated throughout history, there are good reasons why the ISEE Assessment report has flourishing at its core. Firstly, as we have seen, flourishing in educational policy-making has been over-looked in favour of approaches that focus on economics and social utility. The growing emphasis on what can be viewed as a means for achieving flourishing, such as economic growth, scientific and technological advancement, or increased state power, has </span></div><div left="374.0" right="518.5" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="518.5" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.34; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 5.35; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">obscured the ultimate goal. What could be seen as partial means for flourishing have become ends in themselves. This, however, has often led to measures that hinder rather than promote flourishing. Moreover, current educational policy often seems to focus only on a few partial measures for increasing flourishing while neglecting significant ones </span><span style="x0: 488.3; x1: 491.08; y0: 377.82; y1: 387.82; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="488.3" y0="377.82" x1="520.51">(Stiglitz, 1998; brighouse, 2006)</span><span x0="457.82" y0="363.09" x1="506.14" style="x0: 457.82; x1: 460.57; y0: 363.09; y1: 374.09; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.
