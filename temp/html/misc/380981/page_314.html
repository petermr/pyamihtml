Since the potential for flourishing applies to all children, it is necessary to acknowledge the disparity in access to resources and exposure to trauma that are a reality for many. Not all children enter school with their basic needs, like food, security, safety and shelter, met on a regular basis. The first step in closing the gap is to ensure that students&#8217; basic needs are met through school and community resources.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="359.65" top="318.69"><span x0="214.0" y0="318.69" x1="359.65" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.5; y0: 318.69; y1: 329.69; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">6. Schools have an important role in promoting values of inclusion, equality, participation and democracy. Transformative SEL that offers concrete strategies for advancing these values in school settings should be embraced.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="326.42" top="208.3"><span x0="214.0" y0="208.3" x1="326.42" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.5; y0: 208.3; y1: 219.3; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">7. To advance flourishing, active learning approaches that encourage meaning-making and &#8216;first-person&#8217; engagement with curriculum content should be adopted. Examples include interdisciplinary instruction, service learning, and inquiry based, problem based and project based learning. </span></div><div left="374.0" right="501.78" top="508.3"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.3" x1="501.78" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 508.3; y1: 519.3; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">8. Most curricular knowledge is not absolute. It is, therefore, recommended that students in schools have opportunities to engage with different perspectives on &#8216;truth&#8217; and knowledge; to appreciate perspectives and world views that are different from their own; and to participate in their communities to effect change, and consider their role in challenging unjust social, political and/or economic systems.  </span></div><div left="374.0" right="486.71" top="318.7"><span x0="374.0" y0="318.7" x1="486.71" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 318.7; y1: 329.7; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">9. It is recommended that school and classroom activities foster active student voice and democratic participation. Promoting shared decision-making and democracy in the classroom can facilitate socially responsive decisions outside the classroom walls helping to promote the types of ethically informed actions that nurture individual and collective flourishing.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="509.14" top="142.31"><span x0="374.0" y0="142.31" x1="509.14" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 142.31; y1: 153.31; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">10.
