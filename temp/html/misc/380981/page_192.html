The latter represent the dynamism of the learning experience, which is shaped by idiosyncrasies of students and classrooms and changing day-to-day events.Curriculum can hence be seen as the object concerned with the materialization of policies and subject matters, but it is also the experience and the process (a verb if you will) that comes to life in teaching and learning. It is both the collective experience of a class and the first-person experience of a lifelong journey. It includes both the top-down elements of policy-making and teacher deliberation, as well as the bottom-up processes that are introduced into the learning experience as students interact with teachers and other students and engage formally and informally with the curriculum.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="422.38" top="508.87"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.87" x1="422.38" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 377.51; y0: 508.87; y1: 519.87; width: 3.52; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KFZNXS+AGaramondPro-BoldItalic;">- Teaching:</span><span x0="425.13" y0="508.29" x1="514.03" style="x0: 425.13; x1: 428.51; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 3.38; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">the term curriculum as outlined includes teaching; however, teaching is reiterated due to its being a fundamental relationship that permeates most conventionally understood learning spaces (e.g. schools) </span><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 376.78; y0: 417.42; y1: 427.42; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="417.42" x1="423.42">(hattie, 2009)</span><span x0="423.42" y0="415.89" x1="478.07" style="x0: 423.42; x1: 426.17; y0: 415.89; y1: 426.89; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.
