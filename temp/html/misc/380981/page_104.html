For example, not all human beings have the capacity for high jumping, playing a flute or becoming a proficient carpenter or a minister of education.

We suggest that this is a simplistic and mistaken idea, because it cannot be denied that human beings have potentials that are detrimental to themselves and others and/or enact them in a way that is detrimental to themselves or others. This means that a normative evaluation of human potential is necessary.
