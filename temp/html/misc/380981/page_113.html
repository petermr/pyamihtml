Firstly, when one teaches one provokes students to come to understanding.

The point about teaching is that it implies a relational act according to which students are encouraged to act in particular ways. And, to provoke students implies that they are invited to think for themselves &#8211; a matter of being summoned to come to understanding. Secondly, learning happens when students&#8217; potentialities are evoked to come to understanding in agential ways of being and acting </span><span style="x0: 298.45; x1: 301.23; y0: 245.82; y1: 255.82; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="298.45" y0="245.82" x1="342.32">(macintyre, 1999)</span><span x0="234.54" y0="231.09" x1="349.92" style="x0: 234.54; x1: 237.29; y0: 231.09; y1: 242.09; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">. Learning would fail to be learning if students&#8217; potentialities were not evoked in the quest to gain understanding and insight, and be encouraged to embark on academic, political, economic, social and environmental activism. In learning, students act as human agents intent on coming to make sense of what they are taught. That is, their learning becomes significant on the basis of their </span></div><div left="374.0" right="489.99" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="489.99" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.57; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 5.58; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">potentialities being evoked to see the point. When their potentialities are evoked they exercise their freedom to think for themselves and make sense of the world around them. Exercising one&#8217;s freedom is a matter of acting with autonomy. And, when one does act with autonomy one creates opportunities to come to understanding, that is, one constructs meanings, critiques and differences with others. Simply put, one exercises one&#8217;s freedom in a positive way. However, one can also act freely in a negative way whereby one articulates claims unconstrained by the freedom of others. Of course, exercising one&#8217;s freedom in an unhindered way can also be disadvantageous for one&#8217;s relations with others because one might act unjustly towards them. And, when one exercises one&#8217;s freedom in a negative way, unhindered by the freedom of others, there is always the possibility that one can act unjustly towards others. Hence, negative liberty might not necessarily be advantageous to cultivating just human relations.
