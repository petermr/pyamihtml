Each of the three is not seen as standing on its own but rather as closely interconnected with the other two. In the chapter, the three types of relationships are examined from a variety of perspectives but remain focused on school and class levels.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="246.76" top="293.82"><span style="x0: 214.0; x1: 220.67; y0: 293.82; y1: 303.82; width: 6.67; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="214.0" y0="293.82" x1="246.76">Wg1-ch5</span><span x0="249.51" y0="292.29" x1="355.38" style="x0: 249.51; x1: 253.06; y0: 292.29; y1: 303.29; width: 3.55; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">starts by reviewing some philosophical ideas pertaining to these relationships and their ideal manifestations. Most of the chapter, however, is devoted to what we now know about these relationships in education and schools and how these should be designed to promote flourishing. Drawing on empirical research on a variety of subjects, such as teacher&#8211;student relationships, student&#8211;student relationships and students&#8217; conceptions of curricular knowledge, the chapter provides valuable insights into a number of central questions </span></div><div left="374.0" right="516.27" top="508.28"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.28" x1="516.27" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 377.65; y0: 508.28; y1: 519.28; width: 3.65; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">relating to flourishing in schools.

In addition, the chapter analyses the significance of school culture for increased flourishing and suggests ways to make it more conducive to this aim. From there the chapter explores the well-being and flourishing of teachers. It proposes ways in which these could be improved and elaborates on their significance. The chapter concludes by providing a compelling example that highlights the potential ability of schools to contribute to the flourishing of students, staff and the community.</span></div><div left="88.01" right="95.1" top="634.86"><span x0="88.01" y0="634.86" x1="95.1" style="x0: 88.01; x1: 95.1; y0: 634.86; y1: 646.86; width: 7.09; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TrendSlabFour;">1</span></div><div left="53.29" right="127.96" top="602.01"><span x0="53.29" y0="602.01" x1="127.96" style="x0: 53.29; x1: 60.38; y0: 602.01; y1: 614.01; width: 7.09; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.531, 0.53, 0.528]; font-family: JLNIGU+Knockout-HTF31-JuniorMiddlewt;">CHAPTER</span></div></body></html>
