We note three differences. Firstly, in common language, the prime characteristic of happiness is a person&#8217;s positive emotional state &#8211; when someone says they are happy, they express that they are in a good mood, exhilarated, tranquil or satisfied, etc. While we may need to know the person to have a better idea of the type of positive emotional state they are experiencing, we can make some inferences about their positive emotions. Flourishing, on the other hand, is used primarily in reference to an optimal state of something, be it a flower, a tree, a community or a human being. Human flourishing focuses on the ways in which human beings live their lives, for instance, those mentioned in the Delors Report </span><span style="x0: 214.0; x1: 216.78; y0: 220.62; y1: 230.62; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="214.0" y0="220.62" x1="361.69">(international commission on education for the twenty-first century, 1996) </span><span x0="340.24" y0="205.89" x1="359.85" style="x0: 340.24; x1: 343.61; y0: 205.89; y1: 216.89; width: 3.38; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">that people (can) optimally develop. A second and related distinction is that happiness is primarily evaluated from a first-person perspective &#8211; for instance, when a person says they are happy, it is deduced that they are happy. While outsiders may say that the person does not have good reasons </span></div><div left="374.0" right="497.34" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="497.34" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 377.19; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 3.19; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">for being happy, the person&#8217;s own evaluation of happiness is sufficient. Flourishing, however, also has criteria that are not subjective and therefore a person might be mistaken in saying they are flourishing. This is the same as for evaluations about the natural world, for example, we would be surprised if someone were to say that a tree that is affected by acid rain is flourishing. Thirdly, happiness can refer to feelings experienced during short periods of time, for instance when people have received good news or see their good friends again. We do not use the word flourishing in that way. When we say that we are flourishing or that another person is flourishing, we give a positive evaluation of a longer period in time and also about the quality of their life overall. The following example can clarify these distinctions. A homeless person who is addicted to crack can correctly say they are happy when they have just smoked their pipe, while we would disagree with them if they were to say that they are flourishing. It also means that one can say that one flourishes </span></div><div left="53.29" right="127.96" top="602.01"><span x0="53.29" y0="602.01" x1="127.96" style="x0: 53.29; x1: 60.38; y0: 602.01; y1: 614.01; width: 7.09; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: JLNIGU+Knockout-HTF31-JuniorMiddlewt;">CHAPTER</span></div><div left="87.33" right="95.78" top="634.86"><span x0="87.33" y0="634.86" x1="95.78" style="x0: 87.33; x1: 95.78; y0: 634.86; y1: 646.86; width: 8.45; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TrendSlabFour;">2</span></div><div left="55.73" right="164.4" top="274.61"><span x0="55.73" y0="274.61" x1="164.4" style="x0: 55.73; x1: 64.29; y0: 274.61; y1: 288.61; width: 8.55; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.985, 0.731, 0.026]; font-family: JLNIGU+TradeGothicLTStd;">Characteristic of flourishing, is that individuals develop and enact their potential in an optimal way and doing so can mean that at times one has to be persistent, and overcome frustrations and negative emotions.</span></div></body></html>
