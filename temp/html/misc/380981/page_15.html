It looks at the roles of these different kinds of spaces for learning, attainment, interpersonal relationships, skills development, well-being and behaviours across UNESCO&#8217;s four pillars of education. The chapter also explores how learning spaces can be actively shaped, felt and understood through practices and policies that occur within and around them. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="358.19" top="172.55"><span style="x0: 214.0; x1: 222.0; y0: 172.55; y1: 184.55; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.504]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="214.0" y0="172.55" x1="358.19">WoRKing gRouP 4: education - data and evidence</span></div><div left="214.0" right="364.02" top="129.89"><span x0="214.0" y0="129.89" x1="364.02" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 225.72; y0: 129.89; y1: 140.89; width: 11.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The ISEE Assessment was initiated with the idea of using science and evidence as its founding pillars.

Recognizing the diversity of views and perspectives of what a science and evidence based assessment means, a small group of experts was commissioned to provide more clarity and guidance on what evidence means and how data can and should be used in education practice and policy-making. This working group&#8217;s focus is on seeking the best way to provide answers to the questions: what worked?; what is working best generally?; and will a given intervention work here and now? A new taxonomy of eight tiers or levels of evidence guides matching available evidence to these questions and assess the strength of this evidence. The experts in this group provide a deeper understanding of how effect size and consistency of effect sizes influence learning outcomes, and how they can &#8210; and cannot &#8210; be used in practice and policy guidance. They also illustrate the potential of this modern approach to evidence based education by discussing the EEF (Education </span></div></body></html>
