This ability for reflection includes their evaluation of the ways in which they best develop their potential and enact it to live a good life. This will be more or less influenced by their cultural environment. For instance the majority of women around the world will believe that they flourish when they develop their nurturing and caring potential to look after their children. This capacity means that evaluating whether a human being is flourishing has a subjective dimension as well. We will return to this below.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="356.99" top="265.89"><span x0="214.0" y0="265.89" x1="356.99" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.92; y0: 265.89; y1: 276.89; width: 5.92; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">From the explication of potential and naturalism we conclude that flourishing is a hybrid concept: it is naturalistic, culture-dependent and agent-relative. Flourishing is also both objective and subjective: there are potentials that human beings need to be able to develop and enact to say that they are flourishing, but human beings also have their own views, preferences and desires about the ways in which they best develop and enact their potential.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="520.36" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="520.36" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 385.71; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 11.71; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">There are aspects of living that are good for all human beings, simply because they make a life a human life. We identify three main categories of what constitutes &#8216;good&#8217;: firstly, having relationships (with family members, friends, community members, citizens, animals and the environment); secondly, being engaged in activities (e.g. play, work, learning, caring); and thirdly, agency. Note that these categories are general and the ways in which they are enacted are influenced by the culture in which humans live and are dependent on or relative to what is good for an individual human being.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="431.98" top="239.35"><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 381.33; y0: 239.35; y1: 251.35; width: 7.33; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.504]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="239.35" x1="431.98">meaningFul </span></div><div left="374.0" right="523.47" top="207.09"><span x0="374.0" y0="207.09" x1="523.47" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 382.61; y0: 207.09; y1: 218.09; width: 8.61; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Not every relationship and activity that human beings engage in is an expression of their flourishing. When human beings are forced into a relationship or activity (like work) that does not align with their (deepest) values and potential or when they only act out of self-interest to the harm of others, we argue that they do not </span></div><div left="54.0" right="166.43" top="211.69"><span x0="54.0" y0="211.69" x1="166.43" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 65.66; y0: 211.69; y1: 225.69; width: 11.66; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0.985, 0.731, 0.026]; font-family: JLNIGU+TradeGothicLTStd;">We identify three main categories of what constitutes &#8216;good&#8217;: firstly, having relationships; secondly, being engaged in activities; and thirdly, agency.</span></div></body></html>
