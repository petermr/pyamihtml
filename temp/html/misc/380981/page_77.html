If there were a science of well-being or flourishing, it would be important to clarify a philosophy of science of well-being.

Firstly, a circumscription approach to flourishing would aim to circumscribe the notion of flourishing in a particular domain. Philosophers used to follow this approach, describing what flourishing means and interpreting other uses of the term as careless, without any consideration for diversity. Secondly, in a differential realization approach the semantic content of &#8216;well-being&#8217; or &#8216;flourishing&#8217; does not vary, but acknowledges that how the state is realized varies with context. This is relevant to discussions of whether flourishing is a normative concept. That is, a human may realize flourishing in different ways, in different contexts. There </span></div><div left="373.99" right="500.63" top="508.29"><span x0="373.99" y0="508.29" x1="500.63" style="x0: 373.99; x1: 376.82; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 2.83; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">is not necessarily a normative expectation as to how they do so. Finally, contextualism, drawn from contemporary approaches within a philosophy of language, would assert that flourishing assertions themselves need to be indexed to specific circumstances or conditions. We adhere to the second interpretation, suggesting that it is possible to give a general description of flourishing and education, but acknowledging that their interpretations and realizations vary between cultures, traditions and human beings. </span></div><div left="373.99" right="494.38" top="279.09"><span x0="373.99" y0="279.09" x1="494.38" style="x0: 373.99; x1: 379.91; y0: 279.09; y1: 290.09; width: 5.92; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Flourishing can be regarded as a particular interpretation of well-being.
