Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (CARE) or a waitlist control group. The study revealed that those in the CARE group showed greater improvements in self-reports of adaptive emotion regulation and mindfulness, as well as greater reductions in psychological distress and feelings of time urgency than those in the control group. Additionally, observations revealed that teachers who received CARE training were better able to maintain levels of emotional support for students across the school year, </span></div><div left="374.0" right="510.93" top="508.28"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.28" x1="510.93" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 381.26; y0: 508.28; y1: 519.28; width: 7.26; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">while those who did not receive CARE training declined in their level of emotional support.
