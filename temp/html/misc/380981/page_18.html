Review editors, again from different disciplines, were identified to oversee the review process to ensure legitimacy, credibility and the optimal selection of the most appropriate reviewers for each of the chapters across all four working groups. The secretariat overseeing the logistics of the assessment was responsible for compiling the review comments and supporting the review editors to ensure all comments were adequately addressed by the respective chapter authors before they were approved for publication. </span></div><div left="374.0" right="459.99" top="502.91"><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 381.0; y0: 502.91; y1: 520.91; width: 7.0; font-size: 18.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="502.91" x1="459.99">the outPutS</span></div><div left="374.0" right="524.77" top="472.07"><span x0="374.0" y0="472.07" x1="524.77" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 385.71; y0: 472.07; y1: 483.07; width: 11.71; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The results of the ISEE Assessment are presented in four volumes, each presenting the findings from each of the four working groups. As mentioned earlier, three working groups present state-of-the-art knowledge on education and learning based on the CF developed for the ISEE Assessment, and one on the meaning and use of data and evidence. Needless to say, there are many interlinkages across these working groups and attempts have been made to insert cross-references where necessary. </span></div><div left="374.0" right="511.06" top="242.87"><span x0="374.0" y0="242.87" x1="511.06" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 385.71; y0: 242.87; y1: 253.87; width: 11.71; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The SDM is an essential output from the ISEE Assessment. The SDM is presented not as a summary of each working group, but as a synthesis across all the working groups. The SDM is structured along five key questions of relevance for policy-makers. This involved &#8216;harvesting&#8217; the answers to each question from all four volumes and presenting them in an integrated fashion that reflects the complexity and </span></div></body></html>
