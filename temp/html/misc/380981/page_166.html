How to select the most suitable flourishing skills and qualities will be one of the main questions in that process. Arguably, this is where assessments of underlying capacities would be particularly useful as concise predictors of a range of flourishing skills and qualities. Measuring underlying capacities could lead to the development of effective flourishing interventions </span><span style="x0: 214.0; x1: 216.78; y0: 351.42; y1: 361.42; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="214.0" y0="351.42" x1="270.63">(huppert, 2017)</span><span x0="270.63" y0="349.89" x1="347.85" style="x0: 270.63; x1: 273.38; y0: 349.89; y1: 360.89; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">, targeting groups of flourishing skills and qualities rather than limited sets of selected skills/qualities associated with flourishing. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="351.11" top="265.89"><span x0="214.0" y0="265.89" x1="351.11" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 217.72; y0: 265.89; y1: 276.89; width: 3.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Importantly, any plans for large-scale assessments of flourishing would first and foremost need to carefully consider the ethical implications of such evaluations, including informed consent from parents and ascent from adolescents, data handling, and data access by schools and government institutions. For example, it is an open question whether teachers should have access to their students&#8217; individual flourishing data and whether such information could be helpful in </span></div><div left="374.0" right="518.48" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="518.48" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 377.55; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 3.55; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">supporting student flourishing. It is also an open question whether anonymized longitudinal data on student flourishing could be made openly accessible to researchers given the lack of developmental research on the flourishing trajectories of children and adolescents.
