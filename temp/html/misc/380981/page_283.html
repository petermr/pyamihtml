Programmes tend to be more widely available for elementary age students, with fewer stand-alone SEL programmes available for upper grades. However, there is a recognition that SEL can and should be woven into academic instruction. For example, empathy can be practised through literature by understanding and taking on the perspective of different characters. Subject matter curricula like Facing History and Ourselves can promote greater social and personal awareness through exploring connections between historical and modern day events, in addition to empowering students to become advocates for social change. It is possible and necessary to cultivate SEL outside of formal programmes, a topic that will </span></div><div left="373.99" right="508.78" top="508.28"><span x0="373.99" y0="508.28" x1="508.78" style="x0: 373.99; x1: 379.49; y0: 508.28; y1: 519.28; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">be further explored later in this chapter.</span></div><div left="373.99" right="485.59" top="463.89"><span x0="373.99" y0="463.89" x1="485.59" style="x0: 373.99; x1: 380.85; y0: 463.89; y1: 474.89; width: 6.85; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">A related emerging area is transformative SEL, which intersects with social justice and is concerned with advancing equity in access to resources and outcomes in education.
