Attachment is described as an emotional connection to a primary caregiver, with the child seeking their closeness in times of anxiety or stress. Based on the degree of sensitivity and continuity of care one receives, we develop a lifelong attachment style (secure or insecure) that influences our relationships with peers and partners. Attachment styles impact on flourishing &#8211; insecure attachment styles have been particularly associated with mental health and behavioural problems in children </span><span style="x0: 305.02; x1: 307.8; y0: 259.02; y1: 269.02; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="305.02" y0="259.02" x1="351.09">(Fearon and Roisman, 2017)</span><span x0="270.08" y0="244.29" x1="348.42" style="x0: 270.08; x1: 272.83; y0: 244.29; y1: 255.29; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.

Access to nurturing, rich sensory stimulation and warm, responsive, supportive care are the key factors in enabling infants to develop the foundations of their lifelong flourishing. The brain region that is particularly sensitive to the influences of care children receive during infancy is the hippocampus. This region is involved in learning and memory processes throughout the lifespan. Inadequate care or significant stress during infancy can negatively impact the maturation of the hippocampus and result in developmentally delayed mental health problems including anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adolescence and adulthood </span><span style="x0: 491.09; x1: 493.87; y0: 219.42; y1: 229.42; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="491.09" y0="219.42" x1="519.96">(lupien et al., 2009)</span><span x0="417.3" y0="204.69" x1="520.92" style="x0: 417.3; x1: 420.05; y0: 204.69; y1: 215.69; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">, thus diminishing one&#8217;s flourishing prospects. </span></div><div left="374.0" right="508.59" top="156.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="156.29" x1="508.59" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 377.72; y0: 156.29; y1: 167.29; width: 3.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">In cognitive terms, the concept of attachment is linked to mind-mindedness </span><span style="x0: 426.8; x1: 429.58; y0: 131.42; y1: 141.42; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="426.8" y0="131.42" x1="496.2">(meins et al., 2002)</span><span x0="374.0" y0="116.69" x1="509.32" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 116.69; y1: 127.69; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">&#8211; the ability of a parent to tune into what their child is feeling or thinking.
