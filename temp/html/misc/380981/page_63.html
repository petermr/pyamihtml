The chapter begins by acknowledging the nature of education as a dynamic system. It goes on to argue that education for flourishing must be systematic and multi-scalar, sensitive to context and informed by an interdisciplinary approach.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="349.63" top="384.69"><span x0="214.0" y0="384.69" x1="349.63" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 225.72; y0: 384.69; y1: 395.69; width: 11.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The chapter then discusses how education can best contribute to promoting flourishing. It presents two models. The first divides the educational process for flourishing into three central components: (1) curriculum, which encompasses teaching and assessment; (2) learning; and (3) flourishing aims and manifestations. The second model, which is the main contribution of the chapter, presents a novel curricular framework for education in and for flourishing. It suggests that education can promote flourishing through six curricular domains: environment, culture, society, technology, interpersonal and self. The chapter describes each of the domains and briefly explains their potential contribution to flourishing. It is important to stress that the list </span></div><div left="374.0" right="499.76" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="499.76" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.34; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 5.35; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">of domains is not exhaustive, nor are the curricular domains siloed; rather, interrelationships between the curricular domains yield a variety of additional curricular possibilities.
