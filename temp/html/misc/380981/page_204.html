It also encompasses acquiring capabilities that allow a movement from being merely knowledgeable about culture to someone who can benefit from it and potentially contribute to it (e.g. appreciation of knowledge, critical thinking, cultural literacy). Many leading educationalists point to, and elaborate on, the importance of being exposed to past and present culture to expand one&#8217;s potential for a flourishing life </span><span style="x0: 278.51; x1: 281.29; y0: 311.82; y1: 321.82; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="278.51" y0="311.82" x1="357.17">(dewey, 1938; eisner, 1994; Peters, 2010)</span><span x0="285.06" y0="297.09" x1="343.96" style="x0: 285.06; x1: 287.81; y0: 297.09; y1: 308.09; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">. In addition, the definition of flourishing endorsed in this report, which stresses the value of engagement in meaningful activities, reinforces the significance of culture because it is from culture that most activities draw their meaning and value. Moreover, the relationship advocated here reiterates and highlights the appreciation of non-instrumental knowing and critical thinking. In proposing culture as a curricular domain, however, there is by no means a suggestion that the conventional fragmented disciplinary curriculum, critiqued </span></div><div left="373.99" right="413.44" top="508.29"><span x0="373.99" y0="508.29" x1="413.44" style="x0: 373.99; x1: 379.49; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">by many </span><span style="x0: 413.45; x1: 416.23; y0: 509.82; y1: 519.82; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="413.45" y0="509.82" x1="463.99">(dewey, 1933)</span><span x0="463.98" y0="508.29" x1="522.44" style="x0: 463.98; x1: 466.73; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">, is to remain the organizing framework for schools.

Firstly, the association between the cultural domain and formal schooling indicates that this domain, if inadequately delivered, may lead to boredom and antagonism on behalf of students due to the imposing of specific subject matter on students. Special care then needs to be taken when selecting subject matter so as to maximize students&#8217; present and future interest, to form a healthy lifelong relationship with knowledge. Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that the ability to appreciate and benefit from culture often requires a long process in which one learns about it and is exposed to it </span><span style="x0: 467.37; x1: 470.15; y0: 91.82; y1: 101.82; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="467.37" y0="91.82" x1="502.36">(throsby, 2001)</span><span x0="394.54" y0="77.09" x1="504.0" style="x0: 394.54; x1: 397.29; y0: 77.09; y1: 88.09; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.
