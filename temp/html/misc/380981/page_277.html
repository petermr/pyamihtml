Although the term &#8216;discipline&#8217; suggests that clear fields of study exist and each is defined by its own discrete methods of inquiry, this is not always the case.

Regardless, one thing is clear. Individuals do not go out into the world and interact or try to engage with situations by only drawing from a single discipline or field of study at a time. Our engagement is holistic and not able to be predicted in advance. </span></div><div left="373.99" right="485.06" top="508.29"><span x0="373.99" y0="508.29" x1="485.06" style="x0: 373.99; x1: 379.91; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 5.92; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">For this reason, educators increasingly cite the value of interdisciplinary approaches to education.

These domains include environment, culture, society, technology, interpersonal and personal. Interdisciplinary instruction accounts for the overlapping nature of these domains insofar as it involves presenting knowledge of constituent disciplines and their relations, connections to other domains and uses in the everyday world. Generally intended as a complement to specialization, this kind of instruction is often justified as a preparatory method for people to consider factors together that are usually treated in isolation </span><span style="x0: 456.11; x1: 458.89; y0: 193.02; y1: 203.02; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="456.11" y0="193.02" x1="503.86">(bailis, 2002)</span><span x0="503.86" y0="191.49" x1="509.36" style="x0: 503.86; x1: 506.61; y0: 191.49; y1: 202.49; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.
