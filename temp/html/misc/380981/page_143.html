There is strong evidence that cognitive self-regulation significantly predicts a range of positive outcomes across development. For example, better self-regulation during early childhood predicts lower risk behaviours, higher well-being and better educational outcomes in adolescence </span><span style="x0: 277.4; x1: 280.18; y0: 214.62; y1: 224.62; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="277.4" y0="214.62" x1="342.92">(Woodward et al., 2017; Wg2-ch5; Wg3-ch3)</span><span x0="308.94" y0="199.89" x1="350.29" style="x0: 308.94; x1: 311.69; y0: 199.89; y1: 210.89; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.
