The same can be said of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which brought to the fore the power of multidisciplinary science and evidence in informing policy-making for the sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services for the well-being of humanity. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="332.78" top="345.09"><span x0="214.0" y0="345.09" x1="332.78" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 225.72; y0: 345.09; y1: 356.09; width: 11.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The field of education is no different. However, unlike in the environmental field, no previous attempts have been made to undertake an integrated transdisciplinary international assessment of science and evidence in the field of education. Education policy has been widely influenced by anecdotal information and is seldom backed up by transdisciplinary consensus science and evidence. However, our knowledge of learning processes and their bidirectional relationship with their contexts is rapidly increasing due to advancements in all disciplines addressing educational issues, and particularly over the past two decades by research from the field </span></div><div left="374.0" right="504.41" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="504.41" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.34; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 5.35; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">of mind, brain and education. But the exchange of knowledge and information across the various disciplines working on education is challenging, as is the translation of new findings from this transdisciplinary research into educational policy. </span></div><div left="374.0" right="502.24" top="384.69"><span x0="374.0" y0="384.69" x1="502.24" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 381.09; y0: 384.69; y1: 395.69; width: 7.1; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Recognizing the need for, but absence of, a transdisciplinary approach to education and the limited use of science and evidence in education policy-making further strengthens the need for the ISEE Assessment. The term &#8216;assessment&#8217; here refers to a critical evaluation of the state of existing knowledge on education and learning by a team of independent experts drawn from a broad range of relevant disciplines and from across the world. The knowledge base is peer-reviewed scientific literature, but also includes credible grey literature. The Assessment report consists of 25 chapters, which have undergone a blind peer-review process. It assesses findings from across disciplines through deliberative discussions amongst the team of diverse </span></div></body></html>
