Learning to know and think entails both the pursuit of knowledge for preconceived instrumental reasons and also its pursuit for the mere joy of broadening one&#8217;s horizons, and opening avenues for unexpected moments of understanding formed serendipitously by the human mind.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="346.06" top="318.69"><span x0="214.0" y0="318.69" x1="346.06" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.5; y0: 318.69; y1: 329.69; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">2. Learning to do and evaluate &#8211; concerns the various how-tos that are associated with deliberate action in pursuit of ethically based goals. This involves the trajectory of exercising skills, beginning with literacy, numeracy and manual skills (e.g. drawing, cutting) and extends to twenty-first century and technological skills. However, we emphasize the importance of the relationships we have with the material and mental products we create by doing, as we learn to evaluate them with a growing sensitivity to their impact on ourselves, others and the environment. The value is not merely in the doing, but in </span></div><div left="374.0" right="507.19" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="507.19" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.59; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 5.6; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">doing that is embedded within theconcept of flourishing.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="501.05" top="463.89"><span x0="374.0" y0="463.89" x1="501.05" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 463.89; y1: 474.89; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">3. Learning to learn &#8211; reflects the trajectory of developing sophistication, ease and/or speed in acquiring new skills and knowledge. Learning to learn is developed based on being exposed to and practising various methods of learning, developing our own ways of learning by ourselves and through externally imposed challenges. It is at the intersection of all curricular domains with the personal and interpersonal domains because it involves both cultivating metacognitive skills (e.g. self-regulation, attention) and capacities of collaborative learning toward ethically based ends. Learning to learn hence puts us in relation with ourselves and others, when engaged in particular learning tasks.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="500.41" top="155.5"><span x0="374.0" y0="155.5" x1="500.41" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 155.5; y1: 166.5; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">4.
