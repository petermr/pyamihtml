This shift is the result of considering education, not only as an edifice/institution requiring &#8216;pillars&#8217;, but also as a complex process that unfolds based on students&#8217; relationships framed by the curricular domains (and their intersections). This process of a students&#8217; encounter with the curriculum yields a range of learning trajectories that reflect an individual&#8217;s development through various modalities, experiences and processes of learning.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="335.37" top="279.09"><span x0="214.0" y0="279.09" x1="335.37" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 225.72; y0: 279.09; y1: 290.09; width: 11.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The frameworks we propose acknowledge curriculum and learning as combining top-down and bottom-up processes. The curricular domains were described as fields of knowledge, values and practices that can be designed top-down. The learning trajectories reflect the changes in an individual&#8217;s knowledge, values and practices as they engage in that curriculum, reacting and responding to it, which supports the learning experience. In doing so, a bottom-up effect is introduced to the formal </span></div><div left="374.0" right="495.77" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="495.77" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 378.44; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 4.44; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">and taught curriculum. As a consequence of this encounter, the learner internalizes (some of) the knowledge, skills and values to varying extents and develops in the above-mentioned along a continuum from familiarity and understanding to agency (i.e. becoming an active contributor to the knowledge, values and practices in these curricular domains if the individual is so inclined).</span></div><div left="374.0" right="482.05" top="322.69"><span x0="374.0" y0="322.69" x1="482.05" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 377.71; y0: 322.69; y1: 333.69; width: 3.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Importantly, whereas the curricular domains have been demarcated as separate but intersecting, the learning trajectories are intentionally bundled together for two reasons.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="507.12" top="229.48"><span x0="374.0" y0="229.48" x1="507.12" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 229.48; y1: 240.48; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">1. Every curricular domain has the potential to contribute to all learning trajectories. Considering, for example, the encounter of a student with the cultural curricular domain, one can easily envision its contribution to learning to know, to learn, to think, to do and to become.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="507.0" top="92.69"><span x0="374.0" y0="92.69" x1="507.0" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 92.69; y1: 103.69; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">2.
