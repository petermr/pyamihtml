If one were to explain human flourishing in light of potentials it could be that one shows the capacity to accomplish a task, for instance, writing poems; one demonstrates the capability to author poems; and one shows the propensity to accomplish the art of poetry. In all three instances, one has drawn on one&#8217;s potential </span></div><div left="374.0" right="496.98" top="266.14"><span x0="374.0" y0="266.14" x1="496.98" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 377.37; y0: 266.14; y1: 277.14; width: 3.38; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">to write poems. But then, in showing one&#8217;s prowess to write poems one equally becomes adept at taking poetry into a new realm. Thus, one shows the potential to write poems and to produce novel ones. When one&#8217;s potential to pursue poetry is accentuated, one invariably draws on the thoughts of others both rationally and imaginatively; it brings one into a relation with others albeit in reality or fictitiously. On this basis, pursuing one&#8217;s potentials seems to be connected to one&#8217;s flourishing </span></div><div left="214.57" right="462.89" top="363.65"><span x0="214.57" y0="363.65" x1="462.89" style="x0: 214.57; x1: 239.24; y0: 363.65; y1: 395.65; width: 24.67; font-size: 32.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: JLNIGU+BemboMT-SchlbkBold;">Relation between human flourishing and education</span><span x0="54.57" y0="337.97" x1="134.61" style="x0: 54.57; x1: 86.25; y0: 337.97; y1: 397.97; width: 31.68; font-size: 60.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: JLNIGU+Knockout-HTF31-JuniorMiddlewt;">2.3</span></div><div left="79.45" right="104.79" top="611.25"><span x0="79.45" y0="611.25" x1="104.79" style="x0: 79.45; x1: 104.79; y0: 611.25; y1: 647.25; width: 25.34; font-size: 36.0; fill: [1]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TrendSlabFour;">2</span></div><div left="53.86" right="128.52" top="577.28"><span x0="53.86" y0="577.28" x1="128.52" style="x0: 53.86; x1: 60.95; y0: 577.28; y1: 589.28; width: 7.09; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: JLNIGU+Knockout-HTF31-JuniorMiddlewt;">CHAPTER</span></div></body></html>
