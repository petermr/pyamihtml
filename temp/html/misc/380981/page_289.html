Learning to manage difficult emotions, forming and maintaining healthy relationships, and caring for oneself and an ever-widening circle of others are essential to flourishing.  Ideally, approaches to fostering flourishing will be able to grow with children, and have applicability in their lives both in and outside of school, with skills being reinforced and modelled by adults at school, home and in the community.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="512.42" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="512.42" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 377.71; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 3.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">It is not only a question of what children learn but how they apply that knowledge and skill in their lives and the world beyond school. How does their emotional well-being and the well-being of others figure into their choices as they go through life? We can have the same knowledge but apply it in vastly different ways. Preparing children to thrive in a global and interconnected world requires more than rote learning. Co-existing and caring for ourselves and others is necessary for thriving. We are surrounded by reminders that living in ways that are self-focused is not sustainable. We need a more well-rounded education to live and fulfill our potential as human beings, recognizing and honouring our interdependence on each other and the earth. Education for flourishing is not complete without an inner education.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="515.57" top="147.09"><span x0="374.0" y0="147.09" x1="515.57" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.91; y0: 147.09; y1: 158.09; width: 5.92; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Finally, we round out this review by stepping back to look at the broader context in which flourishing for children is fostered.
