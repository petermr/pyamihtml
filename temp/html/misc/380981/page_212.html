To promote flourishing, education should extend students by teaching them to think critically, exercise agency and strive to improve the political and social aspects of society. In addition, education should go beyond the state and the economy and deal with the global and communal aspects of life. This section only touches on this briefly and it is also somewhat difficult to distinguish between the social realm and the interpersonal since the lines between them are blurred. For this reason, some aspects that may be considered as part of the society curricular domain will be examined in this report under the interpersonal curricular domain. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="269.99" top="160.15"><span style="x0: 214.0; x1: 218.67; y0: 160.15; y1: 172.15; width: 4.67; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.586, 0.108, 0.504]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="214.0" y0="160.15" x1="269.99">technologY</span></div><div left="214.0" right="342.37" top="127.89"><span x0="214.0" y0="127.89" x1="342.37" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 225.72; y0: 127.89; y1: 138.89; width: 11.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The word technology, derived from the Greek words &#8216;techne&#8217; (artefact) and &#8216;logos&#8217; (knowledge), refers to the artefacts that are </span></div><div left="374.0" right="499.42" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="499.42" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 376.82; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 2.83; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">invented or adapted with the purpose of addressing human challenges. In this context, artefacts can assume a material (e.g. computer hardware) or non-material form (e.g. software); technology also includes associated processes that surround the use of artefacts. Over the course of history, and especially in the last two centuries, the role of technology in human life has become more central. Moreover, in recent decades accelerated technological changes and advances have made technology indispensable for almost every aspect of life, from work to leisure to personal relationships. The COVID-19 pandemic has only pushed this trend further (</span><span style="x0: 486.58; x1: 493.25; y0: 245.82; y1: 255.82; width: 6.67; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="486.58" y0="245.82" x1="506.02">Wg2- ch6</span><span x0="390.07" y0="231.09" x1="497.05" style="x0: 390.07; x1: 393.26; y0: 231.09; y1: 242.09; width: 3.19; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">for further discussion on education and technology). It is, therefore, essential that education in and for flourishing takes full account of the significance of technology.
