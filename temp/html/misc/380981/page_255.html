With this assumption of the fundamental separateness of human beings, a primary goal of schooling was to support students to &#8216;think for themselves&#8217;; the individual mind was primary and relations between people were secondary or optional.  Moreover, traditional schooling has tended to privilege cognitive advancement (rationality) over emotions, feelings and personal experiences. Curriculum content has tended to be taught objectively &#8210; at arm&#8217;s length from students&#8217; own lives and experiences </span><span style="x0: 325.16; x1: 327.94; y0: 329.8; y1: 339.8; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="325.16" y0="329.8" x1="357.74">(Palmer, 1983; Zajonc, 2009; barbezat and bush, 2014)</span><span x0="234.54" y0="303.07" x1="341.57" style="x0: 234.54; x1: 237.29; y0: 303.07; y1: 314.07; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.

Our being in the world is thoroughly interdependent with the existence of others, in that our experiences, actions, thoughts and utterances are bound up with those of other people and shaped by our perceptual grasp of what the physical and social environment affords. Thus, when students and teachers are engaged in thinking, talking, reading or trying to understand, they are interacting with each other, but also with the contributions and knowledge of other people, contexts and cultures. We include a vignette toward the end of this chapter that demonstrates the impact of a relational orientation in the real-life experiences of students and their community. </span></div><div left="374.0" right="501.78" top="101.47"><span x0="374.0" y0="101.47" x1="501.78" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 377.72; y0: 101.47; y1: 112.47; width: 3.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">In line with the definitions of education and flourishing set out </span></div></body></html>
