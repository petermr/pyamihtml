Such designs would need to carefully monitor types of flourishing interventions delivered to pupils/students over time to enable inferences about the possible developmental impacts. Whilst they are most valuable for understanding developmental changes in flourishing, longitudinal studies require significant funding since they are time-consuming. Cross-sectional studies, where researchers look at flourishing at particular points in time, often in the form of a survey or in neuroscience studies, can provide further understanding of mechanisms underlying flourishing.

However, randomized controlled trials are costly and it often takes several years for their results to be translated into educational practice. For these reasons, there is increasing interest in naturalistic (real-world) implementation studies in flourishing research</span><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 376.78; y0: 180.54; y1: 190.54; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="180.54" x1="462.83">(layard and Ward, 2020)</span><span x0="462.83" y0="179.01" x1="510.74" style="x0: 462.83; x1: 465.58; y0: 179.01; y1: 190.01; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.
