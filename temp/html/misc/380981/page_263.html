Having provided a tentative orientation for this chapter, throughout the following sections we review literature and discuss how education can enhance these fundamental relationships. </span></div><div left="373.99" right="468.53" top="239.5"><span x0="373.99" y0="239.5" x1="468.53" style="x0: 373.99; x1: 385.71; y0: 239.5; y1: 250.5; width: 11.71; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">This section addresses interpersonal relationships with a focus on proximal relationships including teacher&#8210;student relationships and peer relationships.
