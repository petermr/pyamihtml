Valuing here is also a judgement that something is good in some way. Values in this sense are seen as generating reasons for us to behave in a certain way.

While flourishing persons do not have to be or aspire to be morally sanctimonious, it is characteristic for them to value the flourishing of other human beings. At a minimum, they respect the negative freedom of others and, if they have the opportunity, contribute to the possibility that others can flourish as well.
