Framing the learning of technology can be considered to be part of acquiring jobmarket skills; framing it in terms of social justice questions, such as who has access to technology and how does such access shape learning and flourishing, points to intersections with social values. Intersections with the cultural domain come into sharp relief as we consider that cultivating digital literacy can be done by adjudicating knowledge presented in various websites about historical facts </span><span style="x0: 214.0; x1: 216.78; y0: 214.62; y1: 224.62; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="214.0" y0="214.62" x1="325.04">(Wineburg and Reisman, 2015)</span><span x0="325.04" y0="213.09" x1="327.79" style="x0: 325.04; x1: 327.79; y0: 213.09; y1: 224.09; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="310.21" top="181.89"><span x0="214.0" y0="181.89" x1="310.21" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 220.04; y0: 181.89; y1: 192.89; width: 6.04; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Pointing to additional intersections, a relationship between the personal, interpersonal and social domains becomes evident when we consider the development of SEL and contemplative practices as part of the enhancement of cognitive functions, which in turn </span></div><div left="374.0" right="522.86" top="508.3"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.3" x1="522.86" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 378.4; y0: 508.3; y1: 519.3; width: 4.4; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">contributes to one&#8217;s performativity in the job market, or conversely as cultivating pro-social behaviours toward citizenship education </span><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 376.78; y0: 457.02; y1: 467.02; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="457.02" x1="502.24">(davidson et al., 2012; ergas, 2019)</span><span x0="502.24" y0="455.49" x1="504.99" style="x0: 502.24; x1: 504.99; y0: 455.49; y1: 466.49; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="456.64" top="424.15"><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 382.0; y0: 424.15; y1: 436.15; width: 8.0; font-size: 12.0; fill: [0.504]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="424.15" x1="456.64">WhY Six domainS?</span></div><div left="374.0" right="520.17" top="391.89"><span x0="374.0" y0="391.89" x1="520.17" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 385.71; y0: 391.89; y1: 402.89; width: 11.71; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The curriculum is divided into six domains based on deliberations drawing on existing educational and curricular theories and insights from conceptions of flourishing, as well as global challenges and the scientific perspective presented earlier in this report. Building on the rationale for the ISEE Assessment, these have led us to identify central domains that already draw considerable educational attention (society, culture) as well as some domains that may have been underestimated, ignored or marginalized in most educational systems. Based on this, the six domain framework seems to be effective for operationalizing education for flourishing; however, we acknowledge that some may see this framework as incomplete (e.g. some countries may wish </span></div><div left="54.0" right="150.7" top="506.91"><span x0="54.0" y0="506.91" x1="150.7" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 58.27; y0: 506.91; y1: 520.91; width: 4.27; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0.985, 0.731, 0.026]; font-family: JLNIGU+TradeGothicLTStd;">... we reiterate the need to think of the curricular domains in light of Bronfenbrenner&#8217;s ecological model, in which domains interact with each other and, in light of complexity theory, which views education as webs of interconnected and mutually influencing elements.</span></div></body></html>
