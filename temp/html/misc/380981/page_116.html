When an individual thinks on their own they do so privately or in relation to their inner self, possibly comparing their thoughts with existing ones on a particular matter. Through education, an individual&#8217;s thoughts commune with an external other self. Thus, the individual connects their thoughts with those of others, even in a private sphere. In this way, education is both a private and public experience where the thoughts of one person can be brought into conversation with those of others. If such a relation were not present, education would not be possible. This rationale of a human relation organizes teaching, learning and evaluation in specific ways. </span></div><div left="374.0" right="505.16" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="505.16" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 384.56; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 10.56; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">We have identified teaching as provocation, learning as evocation and evaluation as deliberation on the basis that these human acts are manifestations of how education manifests in institutions and practices. In light of such an understanding of education, we contend that human flourishing has greater potential to be realized if it is considered in relation to an understanding of education that holds the promise for human flourishing. If education were not enacted through the agency of provocation, evocation and deliberation it might not be possible to realize human flourishing in the ways suggested above </span><span style="x0: 400.91; x1: 403.69; y0: 259.02; y1: 269.02; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="400.91" y0="259.02" x1="439.23">(Wg2-ch8)</span><span x0="439.23" y0="257.49" x1="441.98" style="x0: 439.23; x1: 441.98; y0: 257.49; y1: 268.49; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="491.31" top="191.13"><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 383.0; y0: 191.13; y1: 209.13; width: 9.0; font-size: 18.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="191.13" x1="491.31">democRatic and coSmoPolitan education</span></div><div left="374.0" right="515.45" top="116.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="116.29" x1="515.45" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 384.56; y0: 116.29; y1: 127.29; width: 10.56; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">We posit that human flourishing is particularly enhanced by a form of education that is democratic and cosmopolitan.
