Indeed, it is critical that we make intentional efforts to devise the most effective educational practices that promote flourishing at all levels of the system. Such efforts must be based on strong conceptual models and sound research. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="323.16" top="331.89"><span x0="214.0" y0="331.89" x1="323.16" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 220.85; y0: 331.89; y1: 342.89; width: 6.85; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Although much has been learned in the past decade about programmes and practices that promote human flourishing in schools, the field has much further to go before firm conclusions can be drawn about the specific ways in which a comprehensive and systemic approach to promoting flourishing in schools advances students&#8217; short-term and long-term school and life success, particularly in relation to ethical dimensions of development, such as compassion in relationships with themselves and others.

For example, what are the processes and mechanisms that lead to successful improvements in students&#8217; prosocial and kind behaviours across areas of the school curriculum? What role does context play? Which programmes and practices work best for which students in helping them flourish and thrive? What role do educators play and how does their own well-being influence the well-being of their students? And under what conditions optimal development fostered? What role does technology play, and what technological advances can foster or deter these efforts? These are the types of questions that are being asked among educators, researchers and policy-makers, and are the types of questions we need to answer in order to determine the factors that lead to the development of students&#8217; flourishing in schools. </span></div><div left="54.0" right="180.98" top="418.28"><span x0="54.0" y0="418.28" x1="180.98" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 62.55; y0: 418.28; y1: 432.28; width: 8.55; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0.985, 0.731, 0.026]; font-family: JLNIGU+TradeGothicLTStd;">Although much has been learned in the past decade aboutprogrammes and practices that promote human flourishing in schools, the field has much further to go before firm conclusions can be drawn about the specific waysin which a comprehensive andsystemic approach to promoting flourishing in schools advancesstudents&#8217; short-term and long-term school and life success.</span></div></body></html>
