Many educational policies across the world emphasize competitiveness, efficiency, accountability and rigorous academic testing regimes. As a result, the &#8216;softer&#8217; aspects of flourishing and social-emotional learning/development are mostly sidelined. To promote human flourishing there is a need for greater systemic support for fostering social and emotional competencies in school. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="347.11" top="150.7"><span x0="214.0" y0="150.7" x1="347.11" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.5; y0: 150.7; y1: 161.7; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">2. Schools that seek to support flourishing need to incorporate an inner education. Students need to be supported to tune in to mind/body processes such as thoughts, feelings, perceptions </span></div><div left="374.0" right="519.67" top="508.3"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.3" x1="519.67" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 378.44; y0: 508.3; y1: 519.3; width: 4.44; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">and sensations and recognize how these shape their choices and actions in the world.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="508.59" top="450.7"><span x0="374.0" y0="450.7" x1="508.59" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 450.7; y1: 461.7; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">3. Mindfulness is an important resource for cultivating flourishing in schools by engaging cognitive processes (executive functions and attentional skills), as well as social-emotional skills (prosocial behaviour, emotion awareness). Meta-analytic research on mindfulness in school settings indicates beneficial impacts for students across cognitive, social and academic areas of functioning.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="514.09" top="274.31"><span x0="374.0" y0="274.31" x1="514.09" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.5; y0: 274.31; y1: 285.31; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">4. Social and emotional learning (SEL) that helps students to manage difficult emotions, form and maintain healthy relationships, and care for themselves and an ever-widening circle of others is essential to flourishing. Approaches to fostering flourishing need to be able to grow with children and have applicability in their lives both in and outside of school, with skills being reinforced and modelled by adults at school, home and in the community.</span></div><div left="54.0" right="191.93" top="506.91"><span x0="54.0" y0="506.91" x1="191.93" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 62.55; y0: 506.91; y1: 520.91; width: 8.55; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0.985, 0.731, 0.026]; font-family: JLNIGU+TradeGothicLTStd;">Social and emotional learning (SEL) that helps students tomanage difficult emotions, form and maintain healthyrelationships, and care for themselves and an ever-wideningcircle of others is essential to flourishing.</span></div></body></html>
