Alongside content itself, the capacity to engage critically with subject matter is central and conveyed through how teachers engage students with the curriculum. The how and why of curricula are arguably as important as, if not more important than, the content itself.  Instructional approaches like inquiry based, problem based and project based approaches engage learners in tasks that emphasize mastery and essential skills including interpretation, analysis, evaluation and synthesis of information. Pedagogy characterized by flexibility and active student engagement that allows for community involvement and shared governance is critical to engendering a global consciousness in students that enables ethically </span></div><div left="374.0" right="519.65" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="519.65" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 376.82; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 2.83; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">informed decisions and actions to improve individual and collective flourishing. </span></div><div left="374.0" right="519.56" top="450.69"><span x0="374.0" y0="450.69" x1="519.56" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 381.25; y0: 450.69; y1: 461.69; width: 7.26; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Turning inward with mindfulness and compassion are ways to encourage self-knowledge. Students become students in the fullest sense, not just of academic subjects, but of themselves. Studying oneself allows for observing the patterns of mind and interrupting unconscious habits and biases. Through contemplative self-study students learn to be receptive to their embodied sensory experience, bringing together the mind and body, thus piercing Cartesian duality. A compassionate and mindful stance practised inwardly further enhances these qualities in relationship with others, honouring our fundamental interconnectedness as social beings. Further, critical pedagogy and transformative SEL empower students as agents of social change through developing critical consciousness to understand and transform societal inequities. Each aspect of this relationship triad reinforces the other, and </span></div><div left="54.0" right="117.78" top="506.91"><span x0="54.0" y0="506.91" x1="117.78" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 62.55; y0: 506.91; y1: 520.91; width: 8.55; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0.985, 0.731, 0.026]; font-family: JLNIGU+TradeGothicLTStd;">Pedagogy characterized byflexibility and active student engagement that allows forcommunity involvement andshared governance is critical to engendering a global consciousness in students that enables ethically informed decisions and actions to improveindividual and collective flourishing.</span></div></body></html>
