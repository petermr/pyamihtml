Flourishing development is dynamic and malleable, influenced by biological, cultural and social factors including influences of educational environment such as school ethos and teacher stress. Educational policy should reflect understanding of these influences. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="337.42" top="346.42"><span x0="214.0" y0="346.42" x1="337.42" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.5; y0: 346.42; y1: 357.42; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">2. Research suggests that the predominant focus of current educational policy on academic performance as the educational priority can undermine student flourishing.

Formulation of educational provisions that aim to support flourishing in children and adolescents in education needs to be based on understanding of the developmental progression of flourishing determinants, psychological needs and neurocognitive capacities, including developmental vulnerabilities and sensitive periods. This will ensure that effective, developmentally appropriate ways of fostering flourishing are designed and implemented in education.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="473.26" top="509.42"><span x0="214.0" y0="509.42" x1="473.26" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 238.67; y0: 509.42; y1: 541.42; width: 24.67; font-size: 32.0; fill: [0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: JLNIGU+BemboMT-SchlbkBold;">Recommendations</span><span x0="54.0" y0="486.16" x1="131.88" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 85.62; y0: 486.16; y1: 546.16; width: 31.62; font-size: 60.0; fill: [0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: JLNIGU+Knockout-HTF31-JuniorMiddlewt;">3.7</span></div></body></html>
