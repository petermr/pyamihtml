This will need attention if we are to ground the science of learning into education policy-making. An international science organization representing multiple disciplines with a mandate on education should ideally carry out an assessment like the ISEE Assessment periodically in the future. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="325.62" top="305.49"><span x0="214.0" y0="305.49" x1="325.62" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 217.72; y0: 305.49; y1: 316.49; width: 3.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">In 2021 UNESCO called for a new social contract in &#8216;Reimagining Our Futures together: A New Social Contract for Education&#8217;.

An education for human flourishing using a whole-brain, learner-centric approach acknowledges the interconnectedness between cognitive, social and emotional dimensions, and how these are influenced heavily by societal and contextual factors. Furthermore, recognizing and understanding the vast individual differences in development and learning is key when designing any social contract on education in any part of the world. </span></div><div left="54.0" right="172.9" top="643.79"><span style="x0: 54.0; x1: 64.66; y0: 643.79; y1: 667.79; width: 10.66; font-size: 24.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="54.0" y0="643.79" x1="172.9">SYnoPSiS</span></div></body></html>
