All members of the school community &#8211; administrators, teachers, staff and students &#8211; were engaged in discussions in which they speculated about who the members of The Breakfast Club might be. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="343.39" top="371.49"><span x0="214.0" y0="371.49" x1="343.39" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 220.85; y0: 371.49; y1: 382.49; width: 6.85; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">After the school holidays, The Breakfast Club decided to take their efforts further and have their classmates engage in random acts of kindness with them. They assigned each classroom in the school to another as their &#8216;anonymous givers&#8217; and gave each classroom a breakfast name (e.g. Cheerios, Blueberry Muffins). Shortly thereafter, anonymous acts of kindness were occurring all over the school. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="355.81" top="181.9"><span x0="214.0" y0="181.9" x1="355.81" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 220.85; y0: 181.9; y1: 192.9; width: 6.85; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">A couple of months went by and the students from The Breakfast Club decided to take their acts of kindness even further. They wanted to spread their giving to the community.

During the final assembly, the food was displayed and The Breakfast Club students stood up one by one to increasing applause from members of the entire school community.

That is, SEL is not only concerned with the promotion of students&#8217; social and emotional competence through the implementation of school and classroom based programmes. SEL can unfold when there is an explicit focus on creating the contexts and conditions in which students are given the power, love and support to follow their heart to make the world a kinder and more compassionate place in which we all can live.</span></div><div left="54.0" right="193.61" top="506.91"><span x0="54.0" y0="506.91" x1="193.61" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 62.55; y0: 506.91; y1: 520.91; width: 8.55; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0.985, 0.731, 0.026]; font-family: JLNIGU+TradeGothicLTStd;">SEL can unfold when there is an explicit focus on creating thecontexts and conditions in whichstudents are given the power, love and support to follow theirheart to make the world a kinderand more compassionate place in which we all can live.</span></div></body></html>
