We now know more about brain development, genetics, the interplay between the brain and its environment, the crucial role of nurturing relationships in early childhood and throughout life, mental health and trauma, and the fundamental role of social-emotional skills in our ability to conduct ourselves wisely and kindly in the world. Studies in these and other fields enable us to say with growing confidence that there are certain conditions, practices, mental states and capacities that are conducive to human flourishing. </span><span style="x0: 309.82; x1: 316.49; y0: 179.82; y1: 189.82; width: 6.67; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="309.82" y0="179.82" x1="344.8">Wg1-ch3 </span><span x0="214.0" y0="165.09" x1="351.5" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 217.38; y0: 165.09; y1: 176.09; width: 3.38; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">thus presents us with important advances that have emerged in the past decades that support the ISEE Assessment as an attempt to recruit such knowledge to the advancement of education in and for flourishing.
