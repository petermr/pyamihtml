Grounding in this sense does not pretend to be fully objective and remains cognizant of the fact that those who engage in the grounding are humans. However, this grounding does aspire to be sensitive to cultural diversity within and across countries, and seeks to reach a level of concreteness that provides the project and the UNESCO Member States with enough to work with, along with ample room within which to navigate. </span></div><div left="214.0" right="246.76" top="143.42"><span style="x0: 214.0; x1: 220.67; y0: 143.42; y1: 153.42; width: 6.67; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="214.0" y0="143.42" x1="246.76">Wg1-ch2</span><span x0="249.51" y0="141.89" x1="328.72" style="x0: 249.51; x1: 255.01; y0: 141.89; y1: 152.89; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">begins by locating flourishing among a number of close or related concepts such as happiness, subjective well-being, eudaimonic well-being and thriving. From there the </span></div><div left="374.0" right="514.23" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="514.23" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 378.4; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 4.4; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">chapter offers a general overview of how flourishing is understood in different key disciplines including philosophy, psychology, neuropsychology, economics and ecology. Next, the chapter introduces this project&#8217;s definition of flourishing and explains and elaborates upon central terms within the definition, such as &#8216;optimal continuing development&#8217;, &#8216;potential&#8217;, &#8216;living well&#8217;, &#8216;meaningful&#8217; and &#8216;satisfying&#8217;. The definition offered does not stem from or relate to a particular theory of flourishing but rather draws on many concepts and perspectives. The next part of the chapter discusses education, emphasizing education as relationships and how this applies to teaching, learning and assessment. From there the chapter turns to connect flourishing and education and argues that the two are intertwined. Education, it is maintained, is essential for flourishing and flourishing can help to improve education. The chapter concludes by pointing to how democracy and cosmopolitanism can contribute to flourishing.</span></div></body></html>
