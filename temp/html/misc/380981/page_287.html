Mindfulness programmes in school settings have been investigated across a range of ages from Pre-K to high school.

For example, it may be appropriate to increase the length of practices as students mature (in terms of age and developmentally), and certain practices like noticing thoughts may resonate more with older students as their cognitive processing and mental world becomes more complex. Physical props and visual aids can assist younger students in practising, for example, by drawing attention to the breath through blowing on a pinwheel or placing a light object on the abdomen to notice how the belly moves up and down with in and out breaths </span><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 376.78; y0: 247.02; y1: 257.02; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="247.02" x1="505.57">(Kaiser-greenland, 2010; center for healthy minds, n.d.)</span><span x0="445.07" y0="232.29" x1="498.38" style="x0: 445.07; x1: 447.82; y0: 232.29; y1: 243.29; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.
