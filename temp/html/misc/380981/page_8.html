The accompanying Summary for Decision-Makers (SDM) addresses overarching key questions and translates the answers into policy-relevant recommendations. In addition, the Assessment highlights gaps in knowledge and suggests potential future research agendas. To be clear, the ISEE Assessment is of a very different nature from international large-scale student assessments, such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Assessments like the one we present here have proved extremely fruitful in other domains (e.g. IPCC) to synthesize information available from a wide range of disciplines. This has never before been performed for education.  </span></div><div left="214.0" right="361.91" top="197.53"><span style="x0: 214.0; x1: 221.0; y0: 197.53; y1: 215.53; width: 7.0; font-size: 18.0; fill: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="214.0" y0="197.53" x1="361.91">the iSee aSSeSSment concePtual FRameWoRK and StRuctuRe</span></div><div left="214.0" right="349.19" top="99.09"><span x0="214.0" y0="99.09" x1="349.19" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 225.72; y0: 99.09; y1: 110.09; width: 11.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">The ISEE Assessment launched </span></div><div left="214.0" right="332.78" top="81.88"><span x0="214.0" y0="81.88" x1="332.78" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 216.83; y0: 81.88; y1: 92.88; width: 2.83; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">in September 2019 with an </span></div><div left="374.0" right="483.55" top="508.29"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.29" x1="483.55" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 378.35; y0: 508.29; y1: 519.29; width: 4.36; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">expert meeting hosted by the Chief Scientist&#8217;s Office, Quebec, Montreal and included approximately 20 scientists from around the world. Expertise was drawn from a range of education-related disciplines, such as international comparative education, human developmental and education psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, economy and philosophy. This group gathered over three days to deliberate if an assessment of education would be beneficial, what it could contribute to education and what should be the conceptual framework. Although there were many disagreements among the experts, two common findings emerged: the need for an assessment of this nature; and the need for a transdisciplinary, multicultural and multiperspective lens to rethink the education agenda for the twenty-first century. </span></div><div left="374.0" right="481.77" top="127.89"><span x0="374.0" y0="127.89" x1="481.77" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 382.57; y0: 127.89; y1: 138.89; width: 8.58; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; stroke: [0.586, 0.109, 0.501]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Developing a conceptual framework is an essential first step when undertaking an assessment of this nature.
