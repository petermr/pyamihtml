To assess student stress, students&#8217; salivary cortisol was collected as a biological indicator of students&#8217; stress reactivity. Biological stress reactivity is frequently assessed via the reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a homeostatic system that follows a circadian rhythm and is activated in response to cognitive (e.g. fear, excitement, anxiety) or non-cognitive (e.g. infections) stressors </span><span style="x0: 214.0; x1: 216.78; y0: 311.82; y1: 321.82; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="214.0" y0="311.82" x1="328.0">(Jessop and turner-cobb, 2008)</span><span x0="328.0" y0="310.29" x1="333.5" style="x0: 328.0; x1: 330.75; y0: 310.29; y1: 321.29; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">. Cortisol levels found in saliva or blood can be used as an indicator for HPA axis activity. The integrity of the HPA axis is essential to human health. In a typical diurnal HPA-axis regulation pattern, cortisol levels rise within 20&#8210;45 minutes after waking and then gradually decline across the day. Inappropriately low or elevated levels of cortisol can compromise HPA axis functioning </span><span style="x0: 308.97; x1: 311.75; y0: 153.42; y1: 163.42; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="308.97" y0="153.42" x1="337.85">(Jessop and turner-cobb, 2008)</span><span x0="299.12" y0="138.69" x1="346.3" style="x0: 299.12; x1: 301.87; y0: 138.69; y1: 149.69; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.

What is not yet known is the direction of the stress contagion. That is, does teachers&#8217; burnout lead to higher levels of stress in students? Or do students who enter the classroom with higher levels of stress lead to increased teacher burnout? Only future research determining this causal relationship will lend further clarity to this relationship.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="498.69" top="173.49"><span x0="374.0" y0="173.49" x1="498.69" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 381.09; y0: 173.49; y1: 184.49; width: 7.1; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Research on teacher attrition provides some interesting insights into the value of understanding the ways in which social and emotional teaching and learning dimensions affect teachers.
