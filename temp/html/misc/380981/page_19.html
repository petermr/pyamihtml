The insights emerging when a range of disciplines combine their relevant research and perspectives are invaluable, offering understandings that sometimes contradict conventional intuitions. It is also important to emphasize the process of consensus building among experts coming from multiple disciplines on findings which might be controversial or uncertain.  </span></div><div left="374.0" right="506.7" top="173.5"><span x0="374.0" y0="173.5" x1="506.7" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 385.71; y0: 173.5; y1: 184.5; width: 11.71; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">This first assessment highlights the richness of evidence and data on learning and education systems, but it also demonstrates how fragmented and compartmentalized these are across the world.
