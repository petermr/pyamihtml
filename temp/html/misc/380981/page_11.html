These chapters look at how equitable education systems have been over the past fifty years and develop interesting insights into how meritocracy &#8210; frequently touted today as the great equalizer &#8210; actually threatens the equity and sustainability of education systems, fuelling acute competitive intensity and narrowing the experience of learning for millions. The concept of &#8216;hereditary meritocracy&#8217; is shown to be a rising trend among Ivy League educational institutions in the United States, where the majority of the students are from the top 1 per cent of the income distribution while a minority come from households in the bottom 60 per cent. In addition, the chapter informs how socio-economic disparities affect the learning of the over 1 billion children who are impacted by poverty.  </span></div><div left="374.0" right="409.53" top="95.02"><span style="x0: 374.0; x1: 379.0; y0: 95.02; y1: 105.02; width: 5.0; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="374.0" y0="95.02" x1="409.53">chapter 2</span><span x0="412.28" y0="93.49" x1="490.64" style="x0: 412.28; x1: 417.62; y0: 93.49; y1: 104.49; width: 5.35; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">on environmental contexts highlights the limitations </span></div></body></html>
