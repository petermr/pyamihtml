Learning to live together concerns the trajectory of developing all aspects of human-to-human communication and relationships, as well as the understanding of social norms within one&#8217;s context.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="346.13" top="331.89"><span x0="214.0" y0="331.89" x1="346.13" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.5; y0: 331.89; y1: 342.89; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">5. Learning to live with nature &#8211; situated in the midst of an ecological crisis, with clear signs of global warming, anthropogenic climate change and species extinction, amongst others, sustainability is not a matter of choice. From young to old and across the globe, there is a need to learn about the current conditions and how we might confront them. Learning to live with nature hence involves the development of awareness and sensitivity to our place in, and responsibility for, the thriving of nature.</span></div><div left="214.0" right="351.83" top="102.7"><span x0="214.0" y0="102.7" x1="351.83" style="x0: 214.0; x1: 219.5; y0: 102.7; y1: 113.7; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">6.

This implies learning to take care of ourselves physically and mentally, which is often necessary for attending to the needs of others. It expands toward learning how to live wisely amidst change, adversity and uncertainty as we contemplate who we are and who we want to become guided by an informed sense of purpose and meaning in life. It involves learning when to actively exercise agency and to change our and others&#8217; conditions as well as when to accept things as they are. Learning to be and become also encompasses when to try to bring about change and when to allow change to happen of its own accord.</span></div><div left="374.0" right="508.9" top="173.5"><span x0="374.0" y0="173.5" x1="508.9" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 377.71; y0: 173.5; y1: 184.5; width: 3.72; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Importantly, while the learning trajectories have been bundled to reflect the fluidity of the experience of learning, the intersections between them are to be acknowledged by curriculum developers and implementers.</span></div></body></html>
