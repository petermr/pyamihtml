Such recommendations from researchers and non-profit organizations supporting the mental health of young people are encouraged by recent surveys with teachers and parents in the United Kingdom (UK). For example, 82 per cent of teachers surveyed said that there is a disproportionate focus on exams in education in contrast to the well-being of students, and 73 per cent of parents would rather send their children to school where </span></div><div left="373.99" right="519.01" top="508.28"><span x0="373.99" y0="508.28" x1="519.01" style="x0: 373.99; x1: 377.37; y0: 508.28; y1: 519.28; width: 3.38; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">they would be happy even if their previous exam results were not good </span><span style="x0: 397.95; x1: 400.73; y0: 483.42; y1: 493.42; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="397.95" y0="483.42" x1="446.81">(minds, 2017)</span><span x0="446.81" y0="481.89" x1="518.34" style="x0: 446.81; x1: 449.56; y0: 481.89; y1: 492.89; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.
