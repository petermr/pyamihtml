An attempt to address complexity requires multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches. No field exhausts the understanding of human beings and social systems, hence different fields and their combination provide entry points for overcoming hindrances to, and promoting, flourishing. A framework for flourishing needs to draw on understandings from various fields, including among others, philosophy, sociology, developmental psychology, biology and neuroscience.</span></div><div left="214.13" right="353.61" top="129.1"><span x0="214.13" y0="129.1" x1="353.61" style="x0: 214.13; x1: 219.63; y0: 129.1; y1: 140.1; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">4.

While promoting flourishing must be sensitive to the context in which it takes place, general directions for achieving it can be devised.   </span></div><div left="374.12" right="489.44" top="397.9"><span x0="374.12" y0="397.9" x1="489.44" style="x0: 374.12; x1: 380.78; y0: 397.9; y1: 408.9; width: 6.65; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">Bearing in mind the above guidelines and the limitations they pose on our ability to provide definitive direction for promoting flourishing through education, we have developed two frameworks. We view them as offering a number of links in a progression from theory toward practice. The first framework establishes the basic components of education in flourishing based on combining commonplaces of educational discourse with understandings depicted above and stemming from previous chapters. The second moves further toward practice by extending the first framework into curriculum development. </span><span style="x0: 434.43; x1: 441.1; y0: 148.62; y1: 158.62; width: 6.67; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="434.43" y0="148.62" x1="467.19">Wg1-ch5</span><span x0="469.94" y0="147.09" x1="522.96" style="x0: 469.94; x1: 475.44; y0: 147.09; y1: 158.09; width: 5.5; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">brings these ideas further into practice within educational spaces (e.g. schools).</span></div><div left="54.0" right="168.79" top="506.91"><span x0="54.0" y0="506.91" x1="168.79" style="x0: 54.0; x1: 62.55; y0: 506.91; y1: 520.91; width: 8.55; font-size: 14.0; fill: [0]; stroke: [0.985, 0.731, 0.026]; font-family: JLNIGU+TradeGothicLTStd;">Context is crucial because what suits and works in one place might be inadequate for another.</span></div></body></html>
