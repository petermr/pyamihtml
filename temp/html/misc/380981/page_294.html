What do we know about the well-being of teachers? How does teachers&#8217; social-emotional competence influence students&#8217; SEL, and how can we promote it? And do prospective teachers receive any information about SEL and their own social and emotional competence in their teacher preparation programmes? The importance of these questions should not be underestimated. If we do not accurately understand teachers&#8217; own well-being and how teachers influence students&#8217; SEL, we can never fully know whether and how to promote SEL in the classroom.
