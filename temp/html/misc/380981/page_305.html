One of the findings discussed with the teachers was from research that illustrated that when individuals engage in altruism &#8210; random acts of kindness &#8211; they become healthier and happier. Following the session, one of the teachers, who taught eighth graders in a school characterized as high risk, shared with her students the research on happiness. With their interest piqued, the students decided to conduct an experiment to determine if they could promote their own happiness by helping others. That school day they then </span></div><div left="374.0" right="504.45" top="508.28"><span x0="374.0" y0="508.28" x1="504.45" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 381.26; y0: 508.28; y1: 519.28; width: 7.26; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">went on to engage in &#8216;random acts of kindness&#8217; for their teachers; holding doors open, offering compliments and helping teachers with various projects.

They decided to name themselves The Breakfast Club and proceeded to do many more acts of kindness for the teachers and staff at their school, beginning first with writing an anonymous letter to all of the teachers telling them how much they were appreciated. The students&#8217; next random act of kindness came with the help of the community. The students asked, &#8216;what do all of our teachers really like? Starbucks coffee!&#8217; The students then went to their local Starbucks and asked if they would donate coffee to all of their teachers. The Starbucks&#8217; employees said yes.
