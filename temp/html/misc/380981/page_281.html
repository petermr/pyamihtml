However, we must acknowledge the disparity in access to resources and exposure to trauma that are a reality for many. Sadly, not all children enter school with their basic needs &#8210; like food and shelter &#8210; met on a regular basis. And some children experience a lack of physical and/or psychological safety in their community and/or home. It is very challenging for a student to focus on learning when they have not eaten a nutritious meal or their family faces housing insecurity. Similarly, emotional and psychological distress also interfere with learning </span><span style="x0: 311.35; x1: 314.13; y0: 272.22; y1: 282.22; width: 2.78; font-size: 10.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+TradeGothicLTStd-BdCn20;" x0="311.35" y0="272.22" x1="361.86">(Shankar and Park, 2016)</span><span x0="256.19" y0="257.49" x1="362.82" style="x0: 256.19; x1: 258.94; y0: 257.49; y1: 268.49; width: 2.75; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">.

We need to truly value education, not as a means of producing workers to feed the economy, but as humans who each have value and the potential to disrupt and reimagine a deficient system. Just as we track GDP, we can examine gaps in health and well-being, across racial groups and the socio-economic spectrum, as benchmarks of a nation&#8217;s success. </span></div><div left="374.0" right="487.06" top="133.89"><span x0="374.0" y0="133.89" x1="487.06" style="x0: 374.0; x1: 381.26; y0: 133.89; y1: 144.89; width: 7.26; font-size: 11.0; fill: [0, 0, 0]; font-family: KTXOUS+AGaramondPro-Regular;">To promote flourishing in children requires attending to their development holistically.
