The AC recommends that the COP invite Parties, operating entities of the Financial Mechanism and relevant entities working on adaptation to take into account the following recommendations, which are based on the outcomes of the meeting of the task force on national adaptation plans (NAPs) referred to in paragraphs 38 and 39 of the report of the AC referred to in paragraph 1 above: </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="a">(a) Recognizing the importance of raising awareness and buy-in for the NAP process by all stakeholders, in order to: </span></div><div><span class="subsubpara" id="i">(i) Generate interest in, demand for and leadership of the NAP process at the national level;  </span></div><div><span class="subsubpara" id="ii">(ii) Make available support for the NAP process better known; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="b">(b) Improving coordination, collaboration and coherence among: </span></div><div><span class="subsubpara" id="i">(i) Bilateral and multilateral agencies and institutions, including the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism;  </span></div><div><span class="subsubpara" id="ii">(ii) Various national ministries;  </span></div><div><span class="subsubpara" id="iii">(iii) Parties and regions, with a view to: </span></div><div><span class="times new roman_10_0">a. Enhancing the accessibility of NAP support;  </span></div><div><span class="times new roman_10_0">b. Further understanding effective pathways to achieving the objectives of the NAP process, on the basis of experience; </span></div><div><span class="times new roman_10_0">c. Fostering coherence in the provision of support, including by better matching needs with support, involving more financial institutions in the NAP process and helping countries to prepare for accessing funding, including from the Green Climate Fund (GCF); </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="c">(c) Enhancing learning as stakeholders increasingly engage in the NAP process, particularly around aspects such as the role of institutional arrangements and monitoring and evaluation.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="3">3. In supporting the monitoring and evaluation of adaptation, the AC recommends that the COP invite Parties, operating entities of the Financial Mechanism and relevant entities working on adaptation to take into account the following recommendations: </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="a">(a) Monitoring and evaluation frameworks need to be appropriate, relevant to needs and tailored to country circumstances. A common set of global indicators is not useful, owing to the context-specific nature of adaptation; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="b">(b) National-level assessments can play a different role in measuring adaptive capacity from subnational or project-based assessments. National-level assessments could, for example, measure the degree of coordination and integration of adaptation in national priorities; </span></div><div><span class="times new roman_6_0">6</span><span class="times new roman_9_0">FCCC/SB/2014/2. </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_9_0_b">8</span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="c">(c) A positive learning environment, which encourages formal and informal learning, including peer-to-peer learning, and which encourages learning from negative as well as positive experiences, is important; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="d">(d) Planning and allocation of resources, both technical and financial, are key for effective monitoring and evaluation systems.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="4">4. In the context of the monitoring and evaluation of adaptation, the AC also recommends that the COP invite the Board of the GCF, with respect to its Results Management Framework, to consider: </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="a">(a) Keeping indicators simple; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="b">(b) Designing indicators that are qualitative as well as quantitative; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="c">(c) Designing indicators in such a way as to capture the progress that countries are able to make in integrating adaptation into their development and sectoral planning, policies and actions; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="d">(d) Giving countries sufficient flexibility to define their indicators in line with their national and local planning, strategies and priorities. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="5">5. Furthermore, the AC agreed to forward the following recommendations resulting from the workshop on best practices and needs of local and indigenous communities referred to in paragraph 45 of its report referred to in paragraph 1 above for consideration by the COP. The COP may wish to: </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="a">(a) Invite Parties to underline the importance of indigenous and traditional knowledge and practices, in a manner commensurate with modern science, for the effective planning and implementation of adaptation, including by encouraging the integration of indigenous, traditional and local knowledge into the NAP process; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="b">(b) Encourage the Adaptation Fund, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the GCF to enhance their consideration of local, indigenous and traditional knowledge and practices and their integration into adaptation planning and practices, as well as procedures for monitoring, evaluation and reporting. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="6">6. Regarding the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, the AC recommends the following actions for consideration by the COP: </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="a">(a) Inviting the Board of the GCF to consider the significant work undertaken under the Cancun Adaptation Framework and on the NAP process as it continues to provide the governance of the Fund; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="b">(b) Inviting the Board of the GCF to engage with institutions that have started initiatives on countries&#8217; readiness to access GCF funding and exploring how more countries can benefit from such initiatives; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="c">(c) Inviting the GEF, in supporting the NAP process and when implementing its new programming strategy on adaptation for the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund for the period 2014&#8211;2018, to consider the findings arising from the meeting of the NAP task force referred to in paragraph 84 and the initial conclusions of the AC on the monitoring and evaluation of adaptation referred to in paragraph 85 of the report of the AC referred to in paragraph 1 above. </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_10_0_i">10</span><span class="times new roman,_6_5_i">th</span><span class="times new roman,_10_0_i">plenary meeting 12 December 2014 </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_9_0_b">9 </span></div></body></html>
