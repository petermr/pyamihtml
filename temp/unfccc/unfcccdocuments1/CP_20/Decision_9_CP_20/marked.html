As no assessment of the financing needs of developing countries has been agreed on at the level of the Convention, it is challenging to assess the adequacy of the financing provided to the GEF. Furthermore, since GEF is only a channel through which financial support is provided to developing countries, an assessment of the adequacy of resources mobilized for developing countries that looks only at the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism will be misleading because of its narrow scope. </span></div><div left="113.42" right="483.95" top="505.04"><span x0="113.42" y0="505.04" x1="483.95" style="background : None" class="para" id="44">44.

As a result, high levels of utilization of STAR allocations were experienced during GEF 5 by all GEF recipients, with an 85 and 80 per cent utilization of overall STAR allocations by SIDS and the LDCs, respectively.
