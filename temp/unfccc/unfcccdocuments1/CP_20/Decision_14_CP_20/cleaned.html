Details of the training programme</span></div><div><span class="para" id="1">1. The courses are intended to train review experts for the technical review of information reported under the Convention related to greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention. All training courses will be available online. For trainees without easy access to the Internet, courses will be distributed electronically; for courses facilitated by instructors, trainees will communicate electronically with the instructor during the training period. At the request of any Party, the training courses will also be made available to other experts interested in the technical review of GHG inventories, provided that this does not require additional resources. All courses will be available upon request to trainees all year round, without facilitation by instructors. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="2">2. A closing seminar for the basic course of the training programme will be offered annually for around 30 participants (new review experts for the technical review of GHG inventories). </span></div><div><span class="para" id="3">3. Additional regional training seminars for new review experts for the technical review of GHG inventories and a refresher seminar for experienced review experts for the technical review of GHG inventories may be offered annually, depending on the availability of resources. The refresher seminars may be offered in conjunction with meetings of lead reviewers, in order to enhance their knowledge and that of other experienced review experts for the technical review of GHG inventories. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="4">4. All training courses will include an examination. Examination procedures will be standardized, objective and transparent. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="5">5. When participants attend a training seminar, the examination will generally take place during that seminar. In all other circumstances, other arrangements for examinations will be made, provided that the examinations take place under the supervision of the secretariat and that no additional resources are required. For courses without a training seminar, the examination will take place online. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="6">6. New review experts for the technical review of GHG inventories who successfully complete the relevant requirements of the training programme and pass the examinations will be invited to participate in centralized or in-country reviews, working alongside experienced review experts. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="7">7. New review experts who do not pass a course examination at the first attempt may retake the examination once only, provided that the expert has fulfilled all of the tasks assigned during the training course in a timely manner and that the retake does not require the secretariat to incur additional costs. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="8">8. Experienced review experts for the technical review of GHG inventories will be invited to take the online training courses. Examinations are not mandatory for experienced review experts but are encouraged, and may take place in conjunction with meetings of lead reviewers. </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_9_0_b">27 </span></div><div><span class="para" id="9">9. Experienced review experts with relevant GHG inventory reporting and review expertise will be invited to act as instructors for relevant courses of the training programme, ensuring that their collective skills cover the subjects addressed in each course. The secretariat will seek to achieve a geographical balance among the instructors participating in the training programme. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="10">10. When selecting new review experts to attend training courses facilitated by instructors, the secretariat will give priority to review experts with relevant GHG inventory reporting expertise, nominated to the UNFCCC roster of experts, from Parties that do not have review experts who have previously participated in review activities. </span></div><div><span class="subchapter" id="B">B.
