The annual technical review process comprises two stages which consider different aspects of the inventories in such a way that all of the purposes described above are achieved by the end of the process. The two stages are: </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="a">(a) Initial assessment by the secretariat; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="b">(b) Review of individual annual inventories by the ERT. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="61">61. The stages of the technical review process complement each other so that, in general, for each Annex I Party, one stage is concluded before the next one is undertaken.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="62">62. Three operational approaches may be used during the second stage of the technical review, namely desk reviews, centralized reviews and in-country reviews, assuming </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_9_0_b">13 </span></div><div><span class="times new roman_10_0">available resources. During a desk review, the inventory information of Annex I Parties will be sent to experts, who will conduct the reviews in their own countries. During a centralized review, the experts will meet in a single location to review the inventory information of Annex I Parties. During an in-country review, experts will visit an Annex I Party to review the inventory information of that Party. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="63">63. The review of individual inventories of Annex I Parties will be conducted annually either as a desk review, as a centralized review or as an in-country review. The GHG inventory of each Annex I Party shall be subject to a desk review at most once every three years. Desk reviews will be conducted only by experienced experts. The GHG inventory of each Annex I Party will be subject to an in-country review at least once every five years. In-country visits will be scheduled, planned and take place with the consent of, and in close coordination with, the Annex I Party subject to review. In general, during a centralized review, up to four GHG inventories should be reviewed; during a desk review up to two GHG inventories should be reviewed. In exceptional circumstances where an individual member of an ERT is unable to attend the centralized or in-country review, that member may contribute to that review from his/her desk. The scope of the individual review differs between years with desk reviews and years with centralized reviews as defined in paragraphs 75 and 76 below. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="64">64. The ERT, based on the findings of the review,</span><span class="times new roman_6_0">3</span><span class="times new roman_10_0">can recommend that the next review be an in-country review. The ERT shall provide in the review report a rationale for the additional in-country review as well as a list of questions and issues to be addressed during the in-country review. The in-country review shall then be scheduled for the year following the review that recommended such a visit. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="65">65. Upon an Annex I Party’s request, the secretariat shall organize an in-country review for that Party. The request for an in-country review shall be submitted to the secretariat no later than the inventory submission due date. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="66">66. At all stages of the inventory review process, individual Annex I Parties under review will have the opportunity to clarify issues or provide additional information. The secretariat will send to these Annex I Parties drafts and the final version of their status report, assessment report and their individual inventory review report. The ERT shall provide a list of preliminary main findings to the Annex I Party at the end of the review week. The ERT shall produce the final version of the review report, taking into account the comments of the Annex I Party. Every effort will be made to reach agreement with each Annex I Party on the content of a report prior to its publication. In the case of an Annex I Party and the expert team being unable to agree on an issue, the Party may provide explanatory text to be included in a separate section of the final review report. All final review reports shall be published and forwarded by the secretariat, together with any written comments on the final review report by the Annex I Party that is the subject of the report, to the COP.  </span></div><div><span class="subchapter" id="C">C.
