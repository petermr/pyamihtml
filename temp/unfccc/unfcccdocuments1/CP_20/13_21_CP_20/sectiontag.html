In general, during a centralized review, up to four GHG inventories should be reviewed; during a desk review up to two GHG inventories should be reviewed. In exceptional circumstances where an individual member of an ERT is unable to attend the centralized or in-country review, that member may contribute to that review from his/her desk. The scope of the individual review differs between years with desk reviews and years with centralized reviews as defined in paragraphs 75 and 76 below. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="328.83" top="517.04"><span x0="113.3" y0="517.04" x1="328.83" style="background : #00ffaa" class="para" id="64">64.
