If project participants demonstrate that the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM does not result in the displacement of activities or people, or does not trigger activities outside the project boundary, that would be attributable to the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM, such that an increase in greenhouse gas emissions by sources occurs, a leakage estimation is not required.  In all other cases leakage estimation is required.  The Executive Board shall develop guidelines to estimate leakage. </span></div><div left="233.28" right="407.44" top="562.85"><span x0="233.28" y0="562.85" x1="407.44" style="x0: 233.28; x1: 241.25; y0: 562.85; y1: 573.89; width: 7.97;" class="timesroman_11_0">ATTACHMENT A TO APPENDIX B </span></div><div left="85.08" right="554.49" top="540.89"><span x0="85.08" y0="540.89" x1="554.49" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 88.76; y0: 540.89; y1: 551.93; width: 3.68;" class="timesroman_11_0">(The attachment A to appendix B, referred to in paragraph 20 of the simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM, shall be developed by the Executive Board, taking into consideration the existing list of barriers for non-afforestation and reforestation CDM project activities, as contained in attachment A to appendix B of annex II to decision 21/CP.8.)</span></div><div left="286.8" right="353.86" top="747.89"><span x0="286.8" y0="747.89" x1="353.86" style="x0: 286.8; x1: 294.77; y0: 747.89; y1: 758.93; width: 7.97;" class="timesroman_11_0">APPENDIX C </span></div><div left="156.12" right="485.21" top="722.15"><span x0="156.12" y0="722.15" x1="485.21" style="x0: 156.12; x1: 166.26; y0: 722.15; y1: 736.19; width: 10.14;" class="times_14_0_b">Criteria for determining the occurrence of debundling </span></div><div left="85.08" right="524.3" top="700.37"><span x0="85.08" y0="700.37" x1="524.3" style="x0: 85.08; x1: 90.6; y0: 700.37; y1: 711.41; width: 5.52;" class="timesroman_11_0">1.
