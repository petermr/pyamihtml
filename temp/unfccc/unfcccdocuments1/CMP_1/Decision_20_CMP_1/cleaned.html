The first set of tables (tables 1 and 2) covers conservativeness factors for sources included in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol.  The second set of tables (tables 3.a, 3.b, 4.a and 4.b) covers conservativeness factors for emissions and removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).

According to paragraphs 22 and 23 of the technical guidance, adjustments should be applied at the lowest level possible at which the problem is identified.

To ensure that the selection of the conservativeness factors from the tables of conservativeness factors for LULUCF contributes to a conservative adjustment in line with paragraph 53 of the guidance, the expert review team should determine whether the individual component or the carbon stock change from the individual pool subject to adjustment leads to an increase of either emissions or removals, and choose the conservativeness factor accordingly from the respective tables, taking into account the year to which the adjustment is applied (base year or year of the commitment period, as appropriate).  For any component or carbon stock change that contributes to increasing emissions, conservativeness factors should be selected from tables 3.a, 4.a or 4.b as appropriate; for any component or carbon stock change that contributes to increasing removals, conservativeness factors  should be selected from tables 3.b, 4.a or 4.b, as appropriate. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="2">2.
