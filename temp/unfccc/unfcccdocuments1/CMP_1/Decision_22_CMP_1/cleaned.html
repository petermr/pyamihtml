Purpose </span></div><div><span class="para" id="147">147. The purpose of the review of information relating to a request, by a Party included in Annex I, for reinstatement of eligibility to use the mechanisms established under Articles 6, 12 and 17, pursuant to paragraph 2 of chapter X of the procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance, is:  </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="a">(a) To provide an objective, transparent, thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of information provided by a Party on matters relating to Articles 5 and 7 which led to the suspension of its eligibility to use the mechanisms; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="b">(b) To provide for an expedited review procedure for the reinstatement of eligibility to use the mechanisms for a Party included in Annex I which is able to demonstrate that it is no longer failing to meet eligibility requirements under Articles 6, 12 and 17; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="c">(c) To ensure that the enforcement branch of the Compliance Committee has reliable information to enable it to consider the request of a Party for the reinstatement of its eligibility to use the mechanisms.  </span></div><div><span class="subchapter" id="B">B.  General procedure </span></div><div><span class="para" id="148">148. The review for the reinstatement of eligibility to use the mechanisms shall be an expedited procedure limited to the review of the matter or matters which led to the suspension of the eligibility.  However, the expedited nature of this review procedure shall not compromise the thoroughness of the examination by the expert review team. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="149">149. Any Party included in Annex I that has been suspended from eligibility to use the mechanisms may, at any time following suspension, submit information to the secretariat on the matter or matters which led to the suspension of eligibility.  To enable the expert review team to perform its tasks, the information submitted by the Party concerned shall be additional to information previously submitted prior to or during the review that led to the suspension of eligibility.  However, information previously submitted by the Party may also be included in the submission, if relevant.  The information submitted by the Party shall be reviewed expeditiously in accordance with these guidelines.   </span></div><div><span class="para" id="150">150. The secretariat shall organize the review in the most expeditious way possible following the procedures established in these guidelines and taking into account the planned review activities in the regular review cycle.  The secretariat shall convene an expert review team for conducting the expedited </span></div><div><span class="timesroman_11_0">review procedures established in these guidelines in accordance with the relevant provisions of section E of part I of these guidelines and shall forward the information referred to in paragraph 149 above to this expert review team. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="151">151. To ensure objectivity, the expert review team for the reinstatement of eligibility shall not be composed of the same members and lead reviewers who formed part of the expert review team that conducted the review which led to the suspension of eligibility of the Party concerned, and shall be composed of members with the necessary expertise for addressing the matter or matters contained in the Party’s submission. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="152">152. Depending on the issue that led to the suspension of the eligibility to participate in the mechanisms, the review shall be performed as a centralized review or an in-country review as provided for in parts II, III, IV and V of these guidelines, as deemed appropriate by the secretariat.</span><span class="timesroman_7_0">14</span></div><div><span class="subchapter" id="C">C.  Scope of the review </span></div><div><span class="para" id="153">153. The review shall cover the information submitted by the Party.  The expert review team may also consider any other information, including information previously submitted by the Party and any information relating to the Party’s subsequent inventory, which the expert review team considers necessary in order to complete its task.  The expert review team shall assess, consistent with the applicable provisions in parts II, III, IV or V of these guidelines, whether the question or questions of implementation that led to suspension of eligibility have been addressed and resolved.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="154">154. If the expedited review for reinstatement of eligibility relates to the submission of a revised estimate for a part of its inventory to which an adjustment was previously applied, the expert review team shall assess whether the revised estimate is prepared in accordance with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance or whether the new information substantiates the original emission estimate provided by the Party.  </span></div><div><span class="subchapter" id="D">D.  Timing </span></div><div><span class="para" id="155">155. A Party included in Annex I that intends to submit information under paragraph 149 above to the secretariat on the matter or matters which led to its suspension of eligibility should provide the secretariat with at least six weeks notice of the date on which it intends to submit such information.  The secretariat, on receipt of such notice, should undertake the necessary preparations with the aim of ensuring that an expert review team is convened and ready to start consideration of the information within two weeks of the receipt of the submission of information under paragraph 149 above from the Party concerned. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="156">156. For the expedited procedure for the review for reinstatement of eligibility, the following time frames shall apply from the date of receipt of the information:  </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="a">(a) The expert review team shall prepare a draft expedited review report within five weeks of the receipt of information from the Party concerned </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="b">(b) The Party concerned shall be provided with up to three weeks to comment upon the draft expedited review report.  If the Party concerned notifies the expert review team, within that period of time, that it does not intend to provide comments, then the draft expedited review report becomes the final expedited review report upon receipt of such notification.  If the Party concerned does not provide any comments within that period of time, the draft expedited review report becomes the final expedited review report </span></div><div><span class="timesroman_6_5">14</span><span class="timesroman_10_0">For example, if the failure to have in place a national system for the estimation of anthropogenic emissions led to  loss of eligibility and such a system has not previously been reviewed, the national system shall be reviewed in accordance with part IV of these guidelines, and such a review to include an in-country visit. </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="c">(c) If comments by the Party are received within the time frame indicated above, the expert review team shall prepare a final expedited review report within three weeks of the receipt of comments on the draft report. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="157">157. The time periods in paragraph 156 (a) to (c) above are considered maximum time periods.  The expert review team and the Party should strive to complete the review in the shortest time possible.  However, the expert review team may, with the agreement of the Party, extend the time periods in paragraph 156 (a) to (c) above for the expedited review procedure for an additional four weeks.   </span></div><div><span class="para" id="158">158. Where the start of the consideration of information by the expert review team is delayed due to the Party giving shorter notice than provided in paragraph 155 above, the expert review team may extend the time in paragraph 156 (a) up to the difference in time between the period for notification in paragraph 155 and the actual notification given by the Party.  </span></div><div><span class="subchapter" id="E">E.  Reporting </span></div><div><span class="para" id="159">159. The expert review team shall, under its collective responsibility, produce a final review report on the reinstatement of eligibility in accordance with the relevant provisions of paragraph 48 of these guidelines and in accordance with the relevant provisions for review reports in parts II, III, IV or V of these guidelines depending on the specific reason for the suspension of eligibility. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="160">160. The expert review team shall include a statement whether the team considered thoroughly all questions of implementation that led to the suspension of the eligibility in the time available for the reinstatement procedure and shall indicate whether there is or is not any longer a question of implementation with respect to the eligibility of the Party concerned to use the mechanisms established under Articles 6, 12 and 17.  </span></div><div><span class="times_11_0_i">2</span><span class="times_7_0_i">nd</span><span class="times_11_0_i">plenary meeting 30 November 2005 </span></div></body></html>
