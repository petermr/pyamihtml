Different eligibility criteria are in use for common activities relating to agriculture, waste, transport infrastructure and power generation (the latter including geothermal power, hydropower, bioenergy and efficiency improvements). Less common activities (in 25–75 per cent of lists) include gas-fired power generation, waste-to-energy processes, sustainable logging, and information and communication technology infrastructure. Of the uncommon activities (less than 25 per cent of lists), notable are nuclear power generation, aviation and mining. Of the 12 taxonomies of countries and institutions reviewed, 10 make use of exclusion lists across mitigation sectors. For adaptation, most taxonomies refer to process-based screening methods rather than an activity list owing to adaptation activities being specific to a given local environment or context. The evaluation baseline for adaptation screening processes is typically based on environmental and climate risk and vulnerability assessments or national, regional or global resilience and biodiversity standards and codes. In addition, 7 of the 12 analysed taxonomies apply the ‘do no significant harm’ principle (to other environmental objectives) when assessing the eligibility of activities. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="123.63" top="207.06"><span x0="113.3" y0="207.06" x1="123.63" style="background : #00ffaa" class="para" id="7">7. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="207.06" x1="484.08" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 148.93; y0: 207.06; y1: 217.02; width: 7.19;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Climate finance providers are advancing more indicators and metrics to measure what climate finance is achieving on the ground. </span><span x0="320.33" y0="195.06" x1="484.22" style="x0: 320.33; x1: 329.18; y0: 195.06; y1: 205.02; width: 8.85;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">Multilateral climate funds (including the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism), multilateral institutions and national development finance institutions are in the process of developing or have already developed frameworks for measuring outputs, outcomes and impacts of climate finance interventions, with the granularity of indicators and metrics increasing.

When assessing the balance of finance between mitigation and adaptation, it is worth considering different approaches to measuring climate finance flows and considering whether data are adjusted by the financial instrument providing the resources. Information on face-value financial volume can be complemented with information on grant-based equivalent financial volume (as is done by the GCF to assess its mitigation and adaptation split). The number of interventions and information on how different institutions allocate finance can also help inform discussions on balance. </span></div><div left="113.3" right="128.55" top="367.5"><span x0="113.3" y0="367.5" x1="128.55" style="background : #00ffaa" class="para" id="21">21. </span><span x0="141.74" y0="367.5" x1="484.01" style="x0: 141.74; x1: 147.83; y0: 367.5; y1: 377.46; width: 6.09;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Public adaptation finance is predominantly delivered through grants while public mitigation finance predominantly takes the form of loans. </span><span x0="395.59" y0="355.5" x1="484.29" style="x0: 395.59; x1: 398.91; y0: 355.5; y1: 365.46; width: 3.32;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">In 2019–2020, grants accounted for 57 and 99 per cent (USD 8.5 billion and USD 1.2 billion) of the face value of bilateral adaptation finance and of adaptation finance from multilateral climate funds respectively, compared with 64 and 95 per cent (USD 5.9 billion and USD 1.1 billion) respectively in 2017–2018.
