Guidance from the Conference of the Parties will address issues relating to policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria, as well as possible relevant aspects of the activities of the operating entity that are related to the Convention;</span></div><div><span class="para" id="3">3.The governing body of the operating entity has the responsibility of ensuring that funded projects related to the Convention are in conformity with the policies, eligibility criteria and programme priorities established by the Conference of the Parties. It will report regularly to the Conference of the Parties on its activities related to the Convention and on the conformity of those activities with the guidance received from the Conference of the Parties;</span></div><div><span class="para" id="4">4.Regular reports by the Chairman or secretariat of the operating entity to its governing body will be made available to the Conference of the Parties through its secretariat. Other official documentation of the operating entity should also be made available to the Conference of the Parties through its secretariat;</span></div><div><span class="para" id="5">5.In addition, the Conference of the Parties should receive and review at each of its sessions a report from the governing body of the operating entity which should include specific information on how it has applied the guidance and decisions of the Conference of the Parties in its work related to the Convention. This report should be of a substantive nature and incorporate the programme of future activities of this entity in the areas covered by the Convention and an analysis on how the entity, in its operations, implemented the policies, eligibility criteria and programme priorities related to the Convention established bythe Conference of the Parties. In particular, a synthesis of the different projects under </span></div><div><span class="cgtimes_12_0">implementation and a listing of the projects approved in the areas covered by the Convention, as well as a financial report including accounting and evaluation of its activities in the implementation of the Convention, indicating the availability of resources, should be included;</span></div><div><span class="para" id="6">6.In order to meet the requirements of its accountability to the Conference of the Parties, reports submitted by the governing body of the operating entity should cover all its activities carried out in implementing the Convention, whether decisions on such activities are made by the governing body of the operating entity or by bodies operating under its auspices for the implementation of its programme. To this end, it shall make such arrangements with such bodies as might be necessary regarding the disclosure of information;</span></div><div><span class="para" id="7">7.The funding decisions for specific projects should be agreed between the developing country Party concerned and the operating entity in conformity with policy guidance from the Conference of the Parties. However, if any Party considers that a decision regarding one of the specific projects does not comply with the policies, eligibility criteria and programme priorities established by the Conference of the Parties in the context of the Convention, the Conference of the Parties should analyse the observations presented and take decisions on the basis of compliance with such policies, eligibility criteria and programme priorities. In the event that the Conference of the Parties considers that this specific project decision does not comply with the policies, eligibility criteria and programme priorities established by the Conference of the Parties, it may ask the governing body of the operating entity for further clarification on this specific project decision and in due time ask for a reconsideration of that decision;</span></div><div><span class="para" id="8">8.The Conference of the Parties will periodically review and evaluate the effectiveness of all modalities established in accordance with Article 11.3.
