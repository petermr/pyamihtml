These inventory guidelines offer a default methodology available to any country that wishes to use it. Countries that already have an established and comparable methodology could continue to use that methodology, provided that they include sufficient documentation to back up the data presented. For Parties using the CORINAIR methodology or other "bottom-up" approaches, this would entail providing activity data and disaggregated emission factors as well as details of the correspondence between theIPCC source categories and those of the CORINAIR or other "bottom-up" approach used.
