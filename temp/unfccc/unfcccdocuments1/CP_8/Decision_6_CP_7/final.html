The implementation of all elements of Article 6 of the Convention, including education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information and international cooperation, will contribute to meeting the objective of the Convention. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="2">2.   All Parties, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities, are responsible for the implementation of Article 6 of the Convention.  The capacity to implement Article 6 activities will vary among countries, as will the priority thematic areas and target audiences, consistent with their sustainable development priorities and the culturally preferred method of programme delivery, in order to increase people’s understanding of the climate change issue.   </span></div><div><span class="para" id="3">3.   Regional, subregional and international cooperation can enhance the collective ability of Parties to implement the Convention, improve synergies, avoid duplication of effort between the different conventions, and ultimately both improve the effectiveness of programming and facilitate its support.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="4">4.   It is important to learn more from countries regarding the needs and gaps in their Article 6 activities, so that Parties, and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that have the resources to do so might effectively target their efforts at providing appropriate support. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="5">5.   Many Parties, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations, as well as the private and public sectors, are already working actively to raise awareness on, and increase understanding of, the causes and impacts of climate change, as well as solutions.  In particular, many governments are already implementing measures that could be linked to Article 6 activities.  However, the lack of adequate financial and technical resources could inhibit some Parties’ efforts to implement such activities, in particular developing country Parties. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="6">6.   The nature of Article 6 activities carried out by Parties can easily be reported.  However, measuring or quantifying the impacts of these activities may be more challenging. </span></div><div><span class="subchapter" id="B">B.
