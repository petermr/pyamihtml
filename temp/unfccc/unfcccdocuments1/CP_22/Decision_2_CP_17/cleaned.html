Climate finance provided by MDBs to developing countries from their own resources was reported as USD 20.8 billion in 2013 and USD 25.7 billion in 2014. The methodology used in the 2014 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows to attribute MDB finance from developed countries to developing countries suggests that USD 11.4 billion in 2013 and USD 12.7 billion in 2014 was delivered by developed countries. A more advanced methodology, which captures better the mobilization effect through the MDBs, suggests that USD 14.9 billion in 2013 and USD 16.6 billion in 2014 can be attributed to developed countries.  </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_10_0_i">Private climate finance  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="18">18. The major source of uncertainty regarding flows to developing countries relates to the amount of private climate finance provided. Initial partial estimates of direct and mobilized private finance are available. Based on project-level data, renewable energy finance by developed country companies in developing countries is estimated at USD 1.8 billion in 2013 and USD 2.1 billion in 2014. Foreign direct investment in greenfield alternative and renewable energy in developing countries was estimated at USD 26.4 billion in 2013 and USD 21.6 billion in 2014. Both estimates are likely to be conservative. OECD and the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) compiled an initial partial estimate of private finance mobilized by developed countries and identified USD 12.8 billion in 2013 and USD 16.7 billion in 2014 of private co-finance. These figures include private finance mobilized from international sources in addition to private finance mobilized domestically in developing countries. These partial estimates of direct private finance and mobilized finance are distinct, and cannot simply be aggregated.  </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_10_0_i">Instruments  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="19">19. The mix of instruments used to channel support differs by funding source (see figure 2). About 35 per cent of the bilateral, regional and other finance reported to the UNFCCC in BRs is spent as grants, 20 per cent as concessional loans, 10 per cent as non-concessional loans, and the remainder through equity and other instruments. About 38 per cent of the reported finance is channelled through multilateral institutions, many of whom are MDBs that utilize capital contributions and commitments from member countries to raise low-cost capital from other sources of funding, including for donor contributions. This enables MDBs to offer a range of instruments and financial products, including grants (9 per cent), loans, including concessional loans, (83 per cent), equity (2 per cent) and other instruments (6 per cent). About 53 per cent of funding from multilateral climate funds is provided as </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_9_0_b">25 </span></div><div><span class="times new roman_10_0">grants, and the remainder is largely concessional loans, which have increased as a share of approved funding over time. Forty-nine per cent of bilateral climate finance reported to the OECD is provided as grants, and 47 per cent as concessional loans. </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_10_0_i">Recipients  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="20">20. Climate finance goes to a wide range of governmental, private and non-governmental entities in recipient countries. However, reporting on recipient institutions is incomplete. For example, recipient data are available for about 50 per cent of the bilateral finance reported to the OECD DAC. For 2013</span><span class="symbol_10_0"></span><span class="times new roman_10_0">2014, developing country governments are specified as the recipients of about 40 per cent of the total flow. Climate finance channelled through other intermediaries may also reach national governments, but this is not captured in the data. Improving data on the recipients of climate finance could be an area for further work. </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_10_0_i">Global finance flows  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="21">21. On a comparable basis, global total climate finance has increased by almost 15 per cent since 2011</span><span class="symbol_10_0"></span><span class="para" id="2012">2012. In dollar terms estimated global total climate finance increased from a high bound estimate of USD 650 billion for 2011</span><span class="symbol_10_0"></span><span class="times new roman_10_0">2012 to USD 687 billion for 2013 and to 741 billion for 2014. Private investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency represents the largest share of the global total; however, the energy efficiency data are much less certain than the renewable energy data. Levels of finance have increased as the costs of clean technology have continued to fall. The coverage of data in the 2016 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows has increased and improved since the 2014 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows, but nevertheless the quality and completeness of data on global total flows are lower than those for flows to developing countries. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="22">22.

Partial data on domestic public finance expenditures of USD 192 billion per year were compiled. If these additional adjustments are included, they raise the upper end of the range to USD 880 billion in 2013 and USD 930 billion in 2014. However, the volume of the climate-related finance and investment flows globally may be higher, given that there are still significant data gaps in critical sectors such as sustainable transportation, agriculture, energy efficiency and resilient infrastructure. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="23">23. Domestic climate finance: Comprehensive data on domestic climate expenditures are not available. Limited information is included in the BURs; estimates of climate-related finance included in national budgets, domestic climate finance provided by national development banks and commitments by developing country national climate funds. These indicative estimates suggest flows of USD 192 billion per year in developed and developing countries.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="24">24. Some studies suggest that most climate finance in aggregate is mobilized and deployed domestically, both in developed and developing countries. In the limited number of developing countries for which information on domestic public climate finance is available, the data suggest that, in these countries, domestic public finance significantly exceeds the inflows of international public climate finance from bilateral and multilateral sources.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="25">25.

Key features of different channels of climate finance for developing countries are summarized in figure 2.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="27">27. Mitigation-focused finance represented more than 70 per cent of the public finance in developing countries reported in 2013 and 2014. Adaptation finance provided to developing countries accounted for about 25 per cent of the total finance. This is similar to 2011–2012, although there has been a slight increase in the proportion of adaptation finance from climate funds and bilateral concessional channels. More than 80 per cent of MDB investments focused on mitigation, and less than 20 per cent on adaptation.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="28">28. There has been a significant role for grants in adaptation finance. Grants represent 88 per cent of adaptation finance approved climate funds and 56 per cent of the bilateral finance reported to the OECD DAC with adaptation as a principal objective. Some least developed countries and small island developing States in Africa and Asia have been among the largest recipients of adaptation finance.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="29">29. About 33 per cent of funding from dedicated climate funds, 42 per cent of climate-related finance in the OECD DAC and 31 per cent of climate finance reported by MDBs is for Asia, often in countries with attractive investment climates. This funding has largely supported mitigation, including REDD-plus,</span><span class="times new roman_6_0">7</span><span class="times new roman_10_0">reflecting the significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the region. About 21 per cent of finance from dedicated multilateral climate funds, 28 per cent of climate-related finance in the OECD DAC and 15 per cent of MDB climate finance is directed to African countries. There has been a growing emphasis on adaptation in this finance. About 23 per cent of funding from dedicated multilateral climate funds, 15 per cent of climate-related finance reported to the OECD DAC and 16 per cent of the climate finance reported by MDBs is directed to Latin America and the Caribbean. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="30">30. There are costs associated with fund management, project development and implementation. These costs are recovered through mechanisms including administrative budgets and implementing agency fees, which vary across funds and institutions. Administrative costs range from less than 1 per cent to nearly 12 per cent of the approved funding. The actual costs are not necessarily proportional to the volumes of finance approved for projects.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="31">31. A broad range of issues can present challenges in accessing climate finance, including: low levels of technical capacity to design and develop projects/programmes and to monitor and evaluate progress; difficulties in following the procedures of the funds to access finance; and low levels of awareness of the need for action and available sources of funding. Several efforts to strengthen “readiness” to access and make use of climate finance are now under way, and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) has recently stepped up its efforts in this regard. Investment in domestic capacity to structure and attract a range of sources of finance is also needed. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="32">32. Ownership of climate finance and alignment of this finance with national climate change priorities and emerging policies and strategies is well recognized as an important element for ensuring effectiveness. Another important dimension is engagement of key stakeholders across government, particularly ministries of finance and planning, and across society, including civil society and the private sector. Most intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) submitted by developing country Parties outlined, in varying levels of detail, the estimated financial costs of the future emission reduction and climate </span></div><div><span class="times new roman_6_0">7</span><span class="times new roman_9_0">In decision </span><span class="times new roman_9_0"><a href="../../../../../temp/unfccc/unfcccdocuments1//CP_16/Decision_1_CP_16/marked.html">1/CP.16</a></span><span class="times new roman_9_0">, paragraph 70, the COP encouraged developing country Parties to contribute to mitigation actions in the forest sector by undertaking the following activities: reducing emissions from deforestation; reducing emissions from forest degradation; conservation of forest carbon stocks; sustainable management of forests; and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.  </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_9_0_b">29 </span></div><div><span class="times new roman_10_0">adaptation scenarios they describe. In general, methodologies used to estimate financial needs or definitions of scope were not specified, and differed substantially. Beyond INDCs, few efforts to assess national or global climate finance needs have been completed since the 2014 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows. INDCs may provide a framework for strengthening ownership in the future. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="33">33. Impact monitoring systems are beginning to mature, although reporting of results remains nascent and relatively slow. GHG emission accounts are a primary metric of impact and effectiveness used for climate finance mitigation, often complemented with relevant output data such as the volume of installed clean energy or reductions in energy consumption. Consistency of methodologies for GHG accounting continues to be a challenge, though progress has been made by development finance institutions, which have adopted common principles. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="34">34. Most adaptation interventions seek to identify the specific number of people that are likely to benefit from the proposed interventions, either directly or indirectly in terms of increased resilience. Ensuring the accuracy of estimates can be challenging, due to difficulties in identifying beneficiaries, establishing baselines and data collection, and defining and tracking resilience over time to what may be slow onset, or 1-in-100 or 1-in-500 year events. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="35">35. Many funders use co-financing as best available evidence of private finance mobilization, and many climate funds use leverage ratios as one of their key results indicators. However, co-finance does not necessarily equate to mobilization, which is often used to imply a more causal relationship between public intervention and associated private finance, which is more complex to prove. High leverage ratios may not always indicate an effective use of public finance, as ratios can also be high in interventions that are the most commercially viable. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="36">36. The 2016 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows identified climate-related global climate finance flows of USD 714 billion on average in 2013–2014 (see figure 1); this is a significant amount, but is relatively small in the context of wider trends in global investment (see figure 3). For example, while investment in clean energy is rising, volumes of finance for high carbon energy in all countries remain considerably higher. Infrastructure and assets are at risk from the impacts of climate change, with serious potential consequences for the global economy.  </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_9_0_b">30 </span></div><div><span class="times new roman_10_0">Figure 3  </span><span class="times new roman,_10_0_b">Global climate finance in context </span></div><div><span class="times new roman,_9_0_i">Note</span><span class="times new roman_9_0">: This figure seeks to put the total volume of global finance flows in the context of wider trends in global investment.
