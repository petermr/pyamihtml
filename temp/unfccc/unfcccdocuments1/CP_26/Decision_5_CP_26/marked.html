However, high-quality data on private investments in sustainable agriculture, forestry and land use, water, waste, and adaptation and resilience are particularly lacking.

One improvement relates to the reporting by type of support, with Parties reporting only on mitigation, adaptation and cross-cutting categories, without including other types of support.

Figure 1 provides a breakdown of global climate finance flows in 2015–2018 by sector, and figure 2 provides an overview of global climate finance and finance flows in 2017–2018 from developed to developing countries.  </span></div><div left="113.27" right="146.94" top="606.65"><span x0="113.27" y0="606.65" x1="146.94" style="x0: 113.27; x1: 118.81; y0: 606.65; y1: 616.61; width: 5.54;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">Figure 1</span><span x0="113.27" y0="594.44" x1="294.92" style="x0: 113.27; x1: 121.02; y0: 594.44; y1: 604.4; width: 7.75;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Global climate finance flows in 2015–2018 </span></div><div left="113.28" right="221.46" top="582.77"><span x0="113.28" y0="582.77" x1="221.46" style="x0: 113.28; x1: 115.96; y0: 582.77; y1: 590.81; width: 2.68;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_8_0">(Billions of United States dollars)</span></div><div left="113.4" right="125.97" top="413.1"><span x0="113.4" y0="413.1" x1="125.97" style="background : None" class="para" id="23">23.</span><span x0="141.72" y0="412.89" x1="484.34" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 148.91; y0: 412.89; y1: 422.85; width: 7.19;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Continued decreases in renewable energy technology costs mean new investment goes further</span><span x0="167.99" y0="401.1" x1="484.29" style="x0: 167.99; x1: 170.48; y0: 401.1; y1: 411.06; width: 2.49;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">.

The rise is most obvious in flows from multilateral climate funds and through bilateral channels.

Mitigation finance remains less concessional in nature, with 30 per cent of bilateral flows, 29 per cent of multilateral climate fund approvals and 3 per cent of MDB investments taking the form of grants.

Institutions in developing countries are increasingly able to meet fiduciary and environmental and social safeguards requirements for accessing funds. Data show a continued increase in the number of national implementing entities of multilateral climate funds as well as an increase in the accreditation of civil society and private entities, with both trends largely driven by the GCF. Significant shares of climate finance approvals from multilateral climate funds are programmed through multilateral accredited and implementing entities.  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.33" top="758.1"><span x0="113.4" y0="758.1" x1="484.33" style="background : None" class="para" id="38">38.The management of climate finance, as well as the development and implementation of projects that it supports, necessarily entails costs. Often recovered through mechanisms such as administrative budgets and implementing agency fees, the degree of such costs varies across institutions by nature of their different approaches and delivery models. In 2017–2018, major multilateral climate funds spent USD 217 million on administration costs, while implementing entity fees amounted to USD 231 million. In general, the administration costs of climate finance management have tended to decrease over time. The alignment of administrative functions between funds (e.g. the GEF administration of the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund) can streamline management and disbursement mechanisms. This is essential in order to retain the trust that contributors and beneficiaries place in the funds. However, it must be balanced by the above-mentioned rise in implementing entities and associated costs.  </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.31" top="608.08"><span x0="113.39" y0="608.08" x1="484.31" style="background : None" class="para" id="39">39.The capacity of institutions to make strategic choices to use climate finance has long been recognized as important.

The GEF has instead incorporated capacity-building objectives into existing project funding through “enabling activities”.

Mechanisms for monitoring the impact of climate finance may be relevant for the implementation of the enhanced transparency framework. While the reporting of results is slowly improving under multilateral climate funds, MDBs do not include information on mitigation and adaptation outcomes in their joint reports and bilateral contributors have varied approaches to reporting on impacts. Emission reduction remains the primary impact metric for climate change mitigation, while adaptation impact continues to be measured primarily in terms of the number and type of people that benefit from projects. It remains difficult to accurately assess the quality of the impacts (i.e. outcomes) achieved, given that they are being presented in a multitude of formats and over varying timescales and are hard to verify. </span></div><div left="113.38" right="125.95" top="242.04"><span x0="113.38" y0="242.04" x1="125.95" style="background : None" class="para" id="42">42.</span><span x0="141.7" y0="241.84" x1="484.23" style="x0: 141.7; x1: 148.89; y0: 241.84; y1: 251.8; width: 7.19;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">A number of decisions have strengthened the way in which gender issues are addressed in the UNFCCC process</span><span x0="261.81" y0="230.04" x1="484.26" style="x0: 261.81; x1: 264.3; y0: 230.04; y1: 240.0; width: 2.49;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">.

Efforts relevant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), are widespread across all actors within the financial sector, with actions concentrated on defining their exposure to climate risks and the economic opportunities linked to climate response measures. However, achieving the goal in Article 2, paragraph 1(c), related to low GHG emission and climate-resilient development, set in the context of Article 2, depends on real-economy actions that reduce emissions in line with temperature goals and help to develop climate resilience. Many actors in the financial sector operate at a number of steps removed from real-economy activities, through stock or bond trading, portfolio allocations, or micro-prudential supervision, which has little direct effect on real-economy investment decisions relative to banks lending to projects, corporations approving capital expenditure plans or governments announcing support incentives. Therefore, measuring the effective role of financial actors in the context of Article 2, paragraph 1(c), is a notable topic of debate among initiatives, including which metrics are most important as indicators of success. </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.27" top="440.07"><span x0="113.39" y0="440.07" x1="484.27" style="background : None" class="para" id="54">54.Several researchers highlight the absence of any independent critique of the motives and impacts of the numerous finance-related initiatives that have emerged since the adoption of </span><span x0="113.39" y0="440.07" x1="484.27" style="background : None" class="para" id="54"><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">the Paris Agreement</a></span><span x0="113.39" y0="440.07" x1="484.27" style="background : None" class="para" id="54">. Such critical engagement will assist in assessing the real-economy contributions of these initiatives towards achieving consistency of finance flows and combating greenwashing in this context.

To date, initiatives with the widest coverage and scope among financial actors are voluntary in nature, often with non-prescriptive commitments to principles. More recently, some initiatives include mandatory implementation requirements against common timelines. Furthermore, some Governments have already signalled that mandatory exclusions or obligations are being placed on institutions, although these remain limited in number and geographical scope.  </span></div><div left="113.39" right="125.96" top="182.05"><span x0="113.39" y0="182.05" x1="125.96" style="background : None" class="para" id="57">57.</span><span x0="141.71" y0="181.84" x1="468.53" style="x0: 141.71; x1: 151.11; y0: 181.84; y1: 191.8; width: 9.4;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">More work needed to promote inclusivity and geographical representation</span><span x0="468.46" y0="182.05" x1="484.28" style="x0: 468.46; x1: 470.95; y0: 182.05; y1: 192.01; width: 2.49;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">. A number of initiatives relevant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), include representation from different regions and both developed and developing countries.

A focus on individual financing or investment decisions that are consistent with a pathway towards low GHG emission and climate-resilient development is not straightforward owing to the significant potential range of what pathways may be followed for achieving the broader goals in Article 2. The trend towards developing climate, green or sustainable finance taxonomies, as seen across multiple public actor initiatives, can support the identification of activities that are consistent with such pathways, but may risk excluding necessary investment in high-emission sectors or activities that can support the overall transition to such pathways. These may be in areas where activities that are consistent are not yet available at scale owing to technological innovation (e.g. steel and/or cement processes), where activities are needed to enable the transition (e.g. financing of mining activities, road building), or where financing is needed to wind down or responsibly manage the retiring of high-emission activities and transition communities away from their reliance (e.g. coal phase-out policies and subsidies). </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.24" top="530.08"><span x0="113.39" y0="530.08" x1="484.24" style="background : None" class="para" id="60">60.Transition finance taxonomies and transition bonds are being developed for private finance actors to finance, for example, transitional activities in the context of financing just transitions, which implies projects that meet certain conditions, such as displacing more carbon-intensive options compared with industry norms; and enabling wider application or integration of less-carbon-intensive options. </span></div><div left="113.38" right="125.95" top="464.07"><span x0="113.38" y0="464.07" x1="125.95" style="background : None" class="para" id="61">61.</span><span x0="141.7" y0="463.86" x1="484.28" style="x0: 141.7; x1: 147.78; y0: 463.86; y1: 473.82; width: 6.09;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Further consideration of climate-resilient development pathways is necessary to complement existing approaches</span><span x0="251.02" y0="452.07" x1="484.29" style="x0: 251.02; x1: 253.51; y0: 452.07; y1: 462.03; width: 2.49;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">.The mapped approaches include a strong focus on actions linked to achieving the goal in Article 2, paragraph 1(a), of </span><span x0="251.02" y0="452.07" x1="484.29" style="x0: 251.02; x1: 253.51; y0: 452.07; y1: 462.03; width: 2.49;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0"><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">the Paris Agreement</a></span><span x0="251.02" y0="452.07" x1="484.29" style="x0: 251.02; x1: 253.51; y0: 452.07; y1: 462.03; width: 2.49;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">, namely financing investments related to low GHG emissions, and to mitigating the physical and transition-related risks of shifting from high- to low-emission development trajectories.
