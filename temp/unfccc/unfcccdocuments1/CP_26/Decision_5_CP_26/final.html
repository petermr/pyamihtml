Due diligence has been undertaken to use the best information available from the most credible sources. In compiling estimates, efforts have been made to ensure that they are based on activities in line with the convergence of operational definitions of climate finance identified in the first BA and to avoid double counting by focusing on primary finance, which is finance for a new physical item or activity. Challenges were nevertheless encountered in collecting, aggregating and analysing information from diverse sources.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="7">7.</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Data uncertainty</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">: Most of the uncertainties associated with each source of data which have different underlying causes identified in the previous BAs persist, although there have been some improvements. Uncertainties relating to the data on domestic public investments result from the lack of geographical coverage and differences in the way tracking methods are applied, as well as significant changes in the methods used for estimating investment in energy efficiency and sustainable transport over time. Uncertainties also arise from the lack of transparency of data for determining private climate finance; the methods used for estimating adaptation finance; differences in the assumptions used in underlying formulas for attributing finance from MDBs to developed countries; the classification of sustainable or green finance; and the incomplete data on non-concessional finance flows. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="8">8.</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Data gaps</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">: Significant gaps in the coverage of sectors and sources of climate finance remain, particularly with regard to private investment, and adaptation and resilience. While estimates of incremental investment in energy efficiency have improved, understanding of the public and private sources of finance and the financial instruments used remains inadequate. For data on sustainable transport, efforts have been made to improve coverage of public and private investment in electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. However, high-quality data on private investments in sustainable agriculture, forestry and land use, water, waste, and adaptation and resilience are particularly lacking. Specifically, adaptation finance estimates, which are context-specific and incremental, are difficult to compare with mitigation finance estimates, and more work is needed on estimating climate-resilient investments.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="9">9.In relation to mapping information relevant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), of </span><span class="para" id="9"><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">the Paris Agreement</a></span><span class="para" id="9">, the lack of a common interpretation of or guidelines on what information qualifies as relevant presents a challenge in adequately capturing the scope and depth of related action.

Such mapping may be non-exhaustive and limited in terms of representation across geographic areas and sectors. It may also obscure the role of actors that work across multiple categories. Given that a significant amount of information considered relevant is to be derived from multiple-member initiatives and coalitions, due to potential benefits of network effects, focusing on these groups may limit the mapping of information from individual cases that may be considered best practice or leading examples. Furthermore, there is a limited track record and limited in-depth information related to implementing activities consistent with or that align with </span><span class="para" id="9"><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">the Paris Agreement</a></span><span class="para" id="9"> that might enable a thorough assessment of their effectiveness, and therefore their relevance, in achieving the goal outlined in Article 2, paragraph 1(c). </span></div><div><span class="para" id="10">10.The limitations outlined above need to be taken into consideration when deriving conclusions and policy implications from the fourth BA.

Progress regarding the consistency of climate finance reporting was observed in the BR4 common tabular format submissions from Annex II Parties and the provision of qualitative information in the documentation boxes of those tables or in the BRs. One improvement relates to the reporting by type of support, with Parties reporting only on mitigation, adaptation and cross-cutting categories, without including other types of support. Nevertheless, improvements in aggregating geographic or sector-based information remains limited owing to differences in the approaches used by Parties and the functionality of the reporting system to allow differences in reporting. Several Parties referred to ongoing work to resolve challenges related to reporting on private finance mobilized by public interventions.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="12">12.Data coverage and granularity of reporting on climate finance received in the BURs of non-Annex I Parties has improved since the previous BA.

The proportion of BURs that include information on finance received rose from approximately 60 per cent in 2014 to over 90 per cent in 2019–2020. A total of 41 Parties have provided quantitative information on climate finance received at the project or activity level in tabular format. Many differences remain in the approaches Parties used for reporting, including time periods of reported data and information on types of support, sectors and financial instruments. Several Parties included additional information in their second and third BURs on whether a project is linked to capacity-building, technology development and transfer, or technical assistance. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="13">13.</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Availability of domestic public climate finance data is increasing, with more countries establishing climate budget tagging systems</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">. Notable improvements were observed in the tracking of domestic climate-related public or private finance flows, with the issuance of green sovereign bonds incentivizing the establishment of regular tracking systems in both developed and developing countries, building on previous work through CPEIRs. Thirteen countries have established tracking systems for national budgets, with a further five countries developing tracking methodologies. In total, estimates of domestic public expenditures on climate change in 2017–2018 amount to approximately USD 86.6 billion (see chap.

The MDB list of activities eligible for classification as mitigation finance includes charging stations for electric vehicles and hydrogen or biofuel fuelling since 2017 and resource efficiency in aquaculture since 2018, while OECD DAC integrated adjustments to adaptation finance eligibility criteria in 2016 to harmonize with a stepwise approach developed by MDBs. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="15">15.The lists of climate mitigation activities developed by MDBs have served in part to inform green or climate-aligned taxonomies in recent years to support the development of the green bond market and/or regulatory efforts in the field of sustainable finance to combat greenwashing and promote the standardization of financial products.

However, the continued rise in public climate finance flows contributing towards both adaptation and mitigation complicates this assessment. The rise is most obvious in flows from multilateral climate funds and through bilateral channels. While the GCF allocates climate finance for projects in this cross-cutting category to adaptation or mitigation, not all institutions do so in their programming or reporting. This makes it more difficult to track progress in scaling up adaptation finance and ultimately achieving balance between finance for adaptation and mitigation objectives.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="34">34.</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Grants continue to be a key instrument for adaptation finance</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">.

During the same period, 9 per cent of adaptation finance flowing through MDBs was grant-based. These figures indicate no change since 2015–2016. Mitigation finance remains less concessional in nature, with 30 per cent of bilateral flows, 29 per cent of multilateral climate fund approvals and 3 per cent of MDB investments taking the form of grants. These figures, however, may not fully capture the added value brought by combining different types of financial instruments, or technical assistance with capital flows, which can often lead to greater innovation or more sustainable implementation.  </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Characteristics of international public climate finance flows in 2017–2018 </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_8_0_i">Annual average (USD billion) </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_8_0_i">Area of support  Financial instrument </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_8_0_i">Adaptation Mitigation REDD+</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_5_0_i">a</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_8_0_i">Cross-cutting  Grants Concessional loans Other </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">Multilateral climate funds</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">b</span><span class="para" id="2">2.7 20% 48% 5% 27% 53% 40% 8% </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">Bilateral climate finance</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">c</span><span class="para" id="29">29.9 21% 65% – 15% 64% 36% &lt;1% </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">MDB climate finance</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">d</span><span class="para" id="39">39.2 25% 75% – – 5% 75% 20% </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0_i">Note</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">: All values based on approvals and commitments. </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">a</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">In decision </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0"><a href="../../../../../temp/unfccc/unfcccdocuments1//CP_16/Decision_1_CP_16/marked.html">1/CP.16</a></span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">, para. 70, the Conference of the Parties encouraged developing country Parties to contribute to mitigation actions in the forest sector by undertaking the following activities: reducing emissions from deforestation; reducing emissions from forest degradation; conservation of forest carbon stocks; sustainable management of forests; and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">b</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">Including: Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme, Adaptation Fund, Bio Carbon Fund, Clean Technology Fund, Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, Forest Investment Program, Global Climate Change Alliance, GCF, GEF Trust Fund, Least Developed Countries Fund, Partnership for Market Readiness, Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience, Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program, Special Climate Change Fund and United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries. </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">c</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">Bilateral climate finance data are sourced from Annex II Parties’ BRs (that further include regional and other channels) for the annual average and thematic split.

Funding committed to SIDS represented 2 per cent of bilateral finance and 10 per cent of finance approved through multilateral climate funds. Of the finance provided to the LDCs and SIDS, the amount targeting adaptation fell slightly in 2017–2018, although the shares remained stable overall. MDBs channelled 11 per cent of their climate finance to the LDCs and 3 per cent to SIDS. As in previous years, adaptation finance as a share of all climate finance to these countries was significantly higher than that of the overall climate finance spending by MDBs.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="37">37.</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">In 2017–2018, there continued to be a push to diversify modalities of access to climate finance</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">.In a 2019 survey of 105 respondents from 45 developing countries, 73 per cent identified finance from multilateral climate funds as the most challenging source of finance to access compared with private finance (62 per cent), MDBs and development finance institutions (30 per cent) and bilateral sources (17 per cent). Institutions in developing countries are increasingly able to meet fiduciary and environmental and social safeguards requirements for accessing funds. Data show a continued increase in the number of national implementing entities of multilateral climate funds as well as an increase in the accreditation of civil society and private entities, with both trends largely driven by the GCF. Significant shares of climate finance approvals from multilateral climate funds are programmed through multilateral accredited and implementing entities.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="38">38.The management of climate finance, as well as the development and implementation of projects that it supports, necessarily entails costs. Often recovered through mechanisms such as administrative budgets and implementing agency fees, the degree of such costs varies across institutions by nature of their different approaches and delivery models. In 2017–2018, major multilateral climate funds spent USD 217 million on administration costs, while implementing entity fees amounted to USD 231 million. In general, the administration costs of climate finance management have tended to decrease over time. The alignment of administrative functions between funds (e.g. the GEF administration of the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund) can streamline management and disbursement mechanisms. This is essential in order to retain the trust that contributors and beneficiaries place in the funds. However, it must be balanced by the above-mentioned rise in implementing entities and associated costs.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="39">39.The capacity of institutions to make strategic choices to use climate finance has long been recognized as important. Both the Adaptation Fund and the GCF have developed readiness programmes, supporting countries to plan for, access and deliver climate finance. Together these funds have approved over USD 285 million in readiness support. The GEF has instead incorporated capacity-building objectives into existing project funding through “enabling activities”. Reviews of these programmes have endorsed the use of readiness support to build all aspects of the capacity required to mobilize finance for climate action, rather than a focus on supporting access to multilateral climate funds.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="40">40.</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Ownership over the end use of climate finance flows remains a critical factor in its effectiveness</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">.The broad concept of ownership encompasses the consistency of climate finance with national priorities, the degree to which national systems are used for both spending and tracking, and the engagement of a wide range of stakeholders. Financial needs are being increasingly articulated, but to date lack sufficient comparability of methods, including for costs, time frames and assumptions, in order to make an accurate assessment of the alignment of climate finance provision with such needs. Ministries of finance and planning are strengthening their commitments to engage in climate change planning, with national-level institutions playing a greater role through domestic tracking, monitoring and verification of climate finance. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="41">41.</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Impact reporting systems and practices for climate finance are maturing</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">. Mechanisms for monitoring the impact of climate finance may be relevant for the implementation of the enhanced transparency framework. While the reporting of results is slowly improving under multilateral climate funds, MDBs do not include information on mitigation and adaptation outcomes in their joint reports and bilateral contributors have varied approaches to reporting on impacts. Emission reduction remains the primary impact metric for climate change mitigation, while adaptation impact continues to be measured primarily in terms of the number and type of people that benefit from projects. It remains difficult to accurately assess the quality of the impacts (i.e. outcomes) achieved, given that they are being presented in a multitude of formats and over varying timescales and are hard to verify. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="42">42.</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">A number of decisions have strengthened the way in which gender issues are addressed in the UNFCCC process</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">. Gender-responsive public finance is likely to be more effective and efficient. Multilateral climate funds have been front runners in mainstreaming gender considerations in governance and operations. Those under the Financial Mechanism now have a mandate to include information on gender considerations in their annual reports to the COP. While advances are being made, there is scarce information on gender-responsive budgeting, suggesting that work remains to be done in integrating gender considerations on the ground.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="43">43.</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">The drivers of climate finance flows can consist of both demand- and supply-side actions but may differ in terms of mitigation or adaptation objectives</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">. For mitigation finance, policy targets and support mechanisms have played a major role in driving climate finance flows, such as in the role of long-term fixed prices in supporting renewable energy deployment and more recently purchasing incentives for electric vehicles and bans on the sale of new combustion engine vehicles in the long term. Cross-cutting features of enabling environments, such as currency stability of exchange rates, stability of policies and </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">enforcement of contracts, particularly in driving finance towards sustainable land use, and maintenance of political will and support, have also proven to be significant drivers. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="44">44.For adaptation finance, the role of national plans, standards and institutions takes on more importance in driving finance flows than may be the case in mitigation finance, owing to the importance of local, context-specific conditions. Building codes, design standards and disaster risk management guidelines play a role in furthering climate resilience within infrastructure and development investments. Furthermore, local and context-specific vulnerabilities require local-level data and information systems on risks to drive investment, particularly in agricultural adaptation activities.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="45">45.</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Although climate finance flows are increasing, they remain relatively small in the broader context of other finance flows, investment opportunities and costs</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">. Climate finance accounts for just a small proportion of overall finance flows, as shown in figure 3. The level of climate finance is considerably below what would be expected in view of the investment opportunities and needs that have been identified. However, although climate finance flows must obviously be scaled up, it is also important to ensure the consistency of finance flows as a whole (and of capital stock) with the long-term goals of </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0"><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">the Paris Agreement</a></span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">, specifically those set out in its Article 2. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="46">46.</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Financial flows and stocks in GHG-intensive activities remain concerningly high</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">.

Efforts relevant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), are widespread across all actors within the financial sector, with actions concentrated on defining their exposure to climate risks and the economic opportunities linked to climate response measures. However, achieving the goal in Article 2, paragraph 1(c), related to low GHG emission and climate-resilient development, set in the context of Article 2, depends on real-economy actions that reduce emissions in line with temperature goals and help to develop climate resilience. Many actors in the financial sector operate at a number of steps removed from real-economy activities, through stock or bond trading, portfolio allocations, or micro-prudential supervision, which has little direct effect on real-economy investment decisions relative to banks lending to projects, corporations approving capital expenditure plans or governments announcing support incentives. Therefore, measuring the effective role of financial actors in the context of Article 2, paragraph 1(c), is a notable topic of debate among initiatives, including which metrics are most important as indicators of success. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="54">54.Several researchers highlight the absence of any independent critique of the motives and impacts of the numerous finance-related initiatives that have emerged since the adoption of </span><span class="para" id="54"><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">the Paris Agreement</a></span><span class="para" id="54">.

A focus on individual financing or investment decisions that are consistent with a pathway towards low GHG emission and climate-resilient development is not straightforward owing to the significant potential range of what pathways may be followed for achieving the broader goals in Article 2. The trend towards developing climate, green or sustainable finance taxonomies, as seen across multiple public actor initiatives, can support the identification of activities that are consistent with such pathways, but may risk excluding necessary investment in high-emission sectors or activities that can support the overall transition to such pathways. These may be in areas where activities that are consistent are not yet available at scale owing to technological innovation (e.g. steel and/or cement processes), where activities are needed to enable the transition (e.g. financing of mining activities, road building), or where financing is needed to wind down or responsibly manage the retiring of high-emission activities and transition communities away from their reliance (e.g. coal phase-out policies and subsidies). </span></div><div><span class="para" id="60">60.Transition finance taxonomies and transition bonds are being developed for private finance actors to finance, for example, transitional activities in the context of financing just transitions, which implies projects that meet certain conditions, such as displacing more carbon-intensive options compared with industry norms; and enabling wider application or integration of less-carbon-intensive options. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="61">61.</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Further consideration of climate-resilient development pathways is necessary to complement existing approaches</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">.The mapped approaches include a strong focus on actions linked to achieving the goal in Article 2, paragraph 1(a), of </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0"><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">the Paris Agreement</a></span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">, namely financing investments related to low GHG emissions, and to mitigating the physical and transition-related risks of shifting from high- to low-emission development trajectories.
