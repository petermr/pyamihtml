Uncertainties relating to the data on domestic public investments result from the lack of geographical coverage and differences in the way tracking methods are applied, as well as significant changes in the methods used for estimating investment in energy efficiency and sustainable transport over time. Uncertainties also arise from the lack of transparency of data for determining private climate finance; the methods used for estimating adaptation finance; differences in the assumptions used in underlying formulas for attributing finance from MDBs to developed countries; the classification of sustainable or green finance; and the incomplete data on non-concessional finance flows. </span></div><div left="113.4" right="120.93" top="461.08"><span x0="113.4" y0="461.08" x1="120.93" style="background : None" class="para" id="8">8.</span><span x0="141.72" y0="460.87" x1="184.23" style="x0: 141.72; x1: 148.91; y0: 460.87; y1: 470.83; width: 7.19;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Data gaps</span><span x0="184.2" y0="461.08" x1="484.33" style="x0: 184.2; x1: 186.96; y0: 461.08; y1: 471.04; width: 2.77;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">: Significant gaps in the coverage of sectors and sources of climate finance remain, particularly with regard to private investment, and adaptation and resilience. While estimates of incremental investment in energy efficiency have improved, understanding of the public and private sources of finance and the financial instruments used remains inadequate. For data on sustainable transport, efforts have been made to improve coverage of public and private investment in electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. However, high-quality data on private investments in sustainable agriculture, forestry and land use, water, waste, and adaptation and resilience are particularly lacking. Specifically, adaptation finance estimates, which are context-specific and incremental, are difficult to compare with mitigation finance estimates, and more work is needed on estimating climate-resilient investments.  </span></div><div left="113.4" right="484.29" top="323.06"><span x0="113.4" y0="323.06" x1="484.29" style="background : None" class="para" id="9">9.In relation to mapping information relevant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), of the Paris Agreement, the lack of a common interpretation of or guidelines on what information qualifies as relevant presents a challenge in adequately capturing the scope and depth of related action. For the fourth BA an actor-specific mapping approach was adopted, as opposed to focusing on particular financial instruments, asset classes, or categories of action, in order to capture what financial sector actors consider to be relevant information on activities to be consistent with or align with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Such mapping may be non-exhaustive and limited in terms of representation across geographic areas and sectors. It may also obscure the role of actors that work across multiple categories. Given that a significant amount of information considered relevant is to be derived from multiple-member initiatives and coalitions, due to potential benefits of network effects, focusing on these groups may limit the mapping of information from individual cases that may be considered best practice or leading examples. Furthermore, there is a limited track record and limited in-depth information related to implementing activities consistent with or that align with the Paris Agreement that might enable a thorough assessment of their effectiveness, and therefore their relevance, in achieving the goal outlined in Article 2, paragraph 1(c). </span></div><div left="113.38" right="484.3" top="125.04"><span x0="113.38" y0="125.04" x1="484.3" style="background : None" class="para" id="10">10.The limitations outlined above need to be taken into consideration when deriving conclusions and policy implications from the fourth BA.

The rise is most obvious in flows from multilateral climate funds and through bilateral channels.

Data show a continued increase in the number of national implementing entities of multilateral climate funds as well as an increase in the accreditation of civil society and private entities, with both trends largely driven by the GCF. Significant shares of climate finance approvals from multilateral climate funds are programmed through multilateral accredited and implementing entities.  </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.0" y1="783.0" y2="783.0"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="113.4" x2="177.24" y1="752.52" y2="752.52"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="177.24" x2="177.721" y1="752.52" y2="752.52"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="177.72" x2="219.719" y1="752.52" y2="752.52"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="219.72" x2="220.201" y1="752.52" y2="752.52"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="220.2" x2="396.839" y1="752.52" y2="752.52"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="396.84" x2="397.32099999999997" y1="752.52" y2="752.52"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="397.32" x2="401.4" y1="752.52" y2="752.52"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="401.4" x2="401.88" y1="752.52" y2="752.52"></ns0:line><ns0:line x1="401.88" x2="538.441" y1="752.52" y2="752.52"></ns0:line></ns0:g><div left="113.4" right="484.33" top="758.1"><span x0="113.4" y0="758.1" x1="484.33" style="background : None" class="para" id="38">38.The management of climate finance, as well as the development and implementation of projects that it supports, necessarily entails costs. Often recovered through mechanisms such as administrative budgets and implementing agency fees, the degree of such costs varies across institutions by nature of their different approaches and delivery models. In 2017–2018, major multilateral climate funds spent USD 217 million on administration costs, while implementing entity fees amounted to USD 231 million. In general, the administration costs of climate finance management have tended to decrease over time. The alignment of administrative functions between funds (e.g. the GEF administration of the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund) can streamline management and disbursement mechanisms. This is essential in order to retain the trust that contributors and beneficiaries place in the funds. However, it must be balanced by the above-mentioned rise in implementing entities and associated costs.  </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.31" top="608.08"><span x0="113.39" y0="608.08" x1="484.31" style="background : None" class="para" id="39">39.The capacity of institutions to make strategic choices to use climate finance has long been recognized as important.

Mechanisms for monitoring the impact of climate finance may be relevant for the implementation of the enhanced transparency framework. While the reporting of results is slowly improving under multilateral climate funds, MDBs do not include information on mitigation and adaptation outcomes in their joint reports and bilateral contributors have varied approaches to reporting on impacts. Emission reduction remains the primary impact metric for climate change mitigation, while adaptation impact continues to be measured primarily in terms of the number and type of people that benefit from projects.

To date, initiatives with the widest coverage and scope among financial actors are voluntary in nature, often with non-prescriptive commitments to principles. More recently, some initiatives include mandatory implementation requirements against common timelines. Furthermore, some Governments have already signalled that mandatory exclusions or obligations are being placed on institutions, although these remain limited in number and geographical scope.  </span></div><div left="113.39" right="125.96" top="182.05"><span x0="113.39" y0="182.05" x1="125.96" style="background : None" class="para" id="57">57.</span><span x0="141.71" y0="181.84" x1="468.53" style="x0: 141.71; x1: 151.11; y0: 181.84; y1: 191.8; width: 9.4;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">More work needed to promote inclusivity and geographical representation</span><span x0="468.46" y0="182.05" x1="484.28" style="x0: 468.46; x1: 470.95; y0: 182.05; y1: 192.01; width: 2.49;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">. A number of initiatives relevant to Article 2, paragraph 1(c), include representation from different regions and both developed and developing countries. For private finance actors, such representation is important, and it reveals how different relative starting points, capacity and skills gaps exist within coalitions that make common commitments. Further, although a significant number of initiatives were identified, many have yet to combine networks to achieve greater effect. Of the 115 partnerships identified of relevance to supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement, with up to 5,181 constituent members, the vast majority (75 per cent) are connected to only one partnership.  </span></div><div left="113.38" right="484.28" top="68.03"><span x0="113.38" y0="68.03" x1="484.28" style="background : None" class="para" id="58">58.Inclusive and broad geographic representation is even more critical among relevant initiatives targeted at public finance actors, regulators and other country-focused actors such </span></div><ns0:g xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" title="rects"><ns0:line x1="55.2" x2="540.0" y1="783.0" y2="783.0"></ns0:line></ns0:g><div left="113.4" right="484.23" top="758.1"><span x0="113.4" y0="758.1" x1="484.23" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 117.82; y0: 758.1; y1: 768.06; width: 4.42;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">as financial centres.

A focus on individual financing or investment decisions that are consistent with a pathway towards low GHG emission and climate-resilient development is not straightforward owing to the significant potential range of what pathways may be followed for achieving the broader goals in Article 2. The trend towards developing climate, green or sustainable finance taxonomies, as seen across multiple public actor initiatives, can support the identification of activities that are consistent with such pathways, but may risk excluding necessary investment in high-emission sectors or activities that can support the overall transition to such pathways. These may be in areas where activities that are consistent are not yet available at scale owing to technological innovation (e.g. steel and/or cement processes), where activities are needed to enable the transition (e.g. financing of mining activities, road building), or where financing is needed to wind down or responsibly manage the retiring of high-emission activities and transition communities away from their reliance (e.g. coal phase-out policies and subsidies). </span></div><div left="113.39" right="484.24" top="530.08"><span x0="113.39" y0="530.08" x1="484.24" style="background : None" class="para" id="60">60.Transition finance taxonomies and transition bonds are being developed for private finance actors to finance, for example, transitional activities in the context of financing just transitions, which implies projects that meet certain conditions, such as displacing more carbon-intensive options compared with industry norms; and enabling wider application or integration of less-carbon-intensive options. </span></div><div left="113.38" right="125.95" top="464.07"><span x0="113.38" y0="464.07" x1="125.95" style="background : None" class="para" id="61">61.</span><span x0="141.7" y0="463.86" x1="484.28" style="x0: 141.7; x1: 147.78; y0: 463.86; y1: 473.82; width: 6.09;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Further consideration of climate-resilient development pathways is necessary to complement existing approaches</span><span x0="251.02" y0="452.07" x1="484.29" style="x0: 251.02; x1: 253.51; y0: 452.07; y1: 462.03; width: 2.49;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">.The mapped approaches include a strong focus on actions linked to achieving the goal in Article 2, paragraph 1(a), of the Paris Agreement, namely financing investments related to low GHG emissions, and to mitigating the physical and transition-related risks of shifting from high- to low-emission development trajectories.
