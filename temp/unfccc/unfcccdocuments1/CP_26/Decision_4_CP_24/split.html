In the case of NDCs, the overall identified costed mitigation and adaptation needs (50 per cent) are comparable to the amount of costed cross-cutting needs (50 per cent), noting that the costed needs expressed as cross-cutting are largely a reflection of one NDC. Although some developing countries provided information on costed needs for mitigation and adaptation by sector and subsector, this information was not provided across all reports. Therefore, it was not possible to provide a comprehensive and accurate overall amount of costed needs by sector and subsector in the first NDR. </span></div><div left="113.27" right="146.0" top="394.05"><span x0="113.27" y0="394.05" x1="146.0" style="x0: 113.27; x1: 119.36; y0: 394.05; y1: 404.01; width: 6.09;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">Table 1 </span><span x0="113.27" y0="381.84" x1="521.37" style="x0: 113.27; x1: 121.02; y0: 381.84; y1: 391.8; width: 7.75;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Overview of sources of reported costed needs of developing countries by type of national report submitted to the UNFCCC </span></div><div left="304.2" right="394.41" top="352.85"><span x0="304.2" y0="352.85" x1="394.41" style="x0: 304.2; x1: 309.56; y0: 352.85; y1: 360.89; width: 5.36;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_8_0_i">Costed needs (USD billion) </span></div><div left="113.4" right="535.65" top="339.17"><span x0="113.4" y0="339.17" x1="535.65" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.31; y0: 339.17; y1: 347.21; width: 4.91;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_8_0_i">Report Total Mitigation Adaptation Cross-cutting Other </span></div><div left="113.4" right="535.89" top="323.52"><span x0="113.4" y0="323.52" x1="535.89" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 119.9; y0: 323.52; y1: 332.52; width: 6.5;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">AC 44.10 (100%) – 44.10 (100%) – – </span></div><div left="113.4" right="134.13" top="309.48"><span x0="113.4" y0="309.48" x1="134.13" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 119.4; y0: 309.48; y1: 318.48; width: 6.0;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">BUR 11 465.53–11 465.90 (100%) 5 286.94–5 287.31 (46%) 3 628.81 (32%) 2 550.01 (22%) – </span></div><div left="113.4" right="138.21" top="275.52"><span x0="113.4" y0="275.52" x1="138.21" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.9; y0: 275.52; y1: 284.52; width: 5.5;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">LEDS 1 707.15–1 707.35 (100%) 1 407.15–1 407.34 (82%) 300.00 (18%) – – </span></div><div left="113.4" right="133.65" top="261.48"><span x0="113.4" y0="261.48" x1="133.65" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 119.9; y0: 261.48; y1: 270.48; width: 6.5;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">NAP 135.02–135.03 (100%) – 135.02 (100%) – – </span></div><div left="113.4" right="140.13" top="237.48"><span x0="113.4" y0="237.48" x1="140.13" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 119.9; y0: 237.48; y1: 246.48; width: 6.5;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">NAPA 10.05 (100%) – 10.05 (100%) – – </span></div><div left="113.4" right="128.13" top="213.48"><span x0="113.4" y0="213.48" x1="128.13" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 119.9; y0: 213.48; y1: 222.48; width: 6.5;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">NC 8 845.85–8 934.94 (100%) 5 019.30–5 033.83 (56–57%) 3 812.06–3 882.07 (43%) 2.23 (&gt;0%) 12.25–16.81 (&gt;0%) </span></div><div left="113.4" right="134.61" top="189.48"><span x0="113.4" y0="189.48" x1="134.61" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 119.9; y0: 189.48; y1: 198.48; width: 6.5;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">NDC 5 817.48–5 888.56 (100%) 2 156.05–2 156.13  (37%) 764.24–835.24 (13–14%) 2 893.39 (49–50%) 3.81 (&gt;0%) </span></div><div left="113.4" right="132.69" top="165.48"><span x0="113.4" y0="165.48" x1="132.69" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.9; y0: 165.48; y1: 174.48; width: 5.5;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">TAP 40.74 (100%) 21.97 (54%) 18.76 (46%) – 0.01 (&gt;0%) </span></div><div left="113.4" right="134.13" top="141.48"><span x0="113.4" y0="141.48" x1="134.13" style="x0: 113.4; x1: 118.9; y0: 141.48; y1: 150.48; width: 5.5;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">TNA 88.24–92.33 (100%) 30.33–34.33 (34–37%) 57.9–57.98 (63–68%) 0.01 (&gt;0%) – </span></div><div left="120.48" right="141.02" top="115.2"><span x0="120.48" y0="115.2" x1="141.02" style="x0: 120.48; x1: 126.48; y0: 115.2; y1: 124.2; width: 6.0;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0_i">Notes</span><span x0="141.0" y0="115.2" x1="529.45" style="x0: 141.0; x1: 143.5; y0: 115.2; y1: 124.2; width: 2.5;" class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">: (1) Ranges of costs included where available.
