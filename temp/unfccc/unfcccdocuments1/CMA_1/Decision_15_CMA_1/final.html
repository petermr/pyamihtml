To achieve the purpose and goals of </span><span class="para" id="5"><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">the Paris Agreement</a></span><span class="para" id="5">, there is a pressing need to accelerate and strengthen technological innovation so that it can deliver environmentally and socially sound, cost-effective and better-performing climate technologies on a larger and more widespread scale.  </span></div><div><span class="para" id="6">6. Actions and activities under this key theme should therefore accelerate and scale up innovation at different stages of the technology cycle, addressing both adaptation and mitigation in a balanced manner to help countries to build resilience and reduce their emissions, and be undertaken in a manner that enhances the effective participation of developing country Parties, fosters sustainable development and ensures gender responsiveness. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="7">7. Fostering innovation could be done through new collaborative approaches to climate technology research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D); the creation and promotion of relevant enabling policy to incentivize and nurture a supportive environment for innovation; and the active engagement of the private sector and closer collaboration between the public and private sector. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="8">8.

Actions and activities under this key theme should also facilitate the implementation of mitigation and adaptation action identified using planning tools and processes such as nationally determined contributions, long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, technology needs assessments (TNAs), national adaptation plans, technology road maps and other relevant policies, and facilitate overcoming challenges by implementing such action, as appropriate. </span></div><div><span class="para" id="12">12. Actions and activities in this area of work include: </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="a">(a) Facilitating the undertaking and updating of TNAs, as well as enhancing the implementation of their results, particularly technology action plans and project ideas, and capacity-building related to TNAs; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="b">(b) Promoting the link or alignment of TNAs with nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans in order to increase coherence between the implementation of those national plans with national strategies to achieve climate-resilient and low-emission development; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="c">(c) Reviewing the TNA guidelines and updating them as necessary with a view to TNAs leading to plans and implementation that are aligned with the transformational changes envisioned in </span><span class="subpara" id="c"><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">the Paris Agreement</a></span><span class="subpara" id="c">; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="d">(d) Identifying and developing recommendations on approaches, tools and means, as appropriate, for the assessment of the technologies that are ready to transfer; </span></div><div><span class="subpara" id="e">(e) Identifying and developing recommendations for the enhancement of enabling environments for and the addressing of barriers to the development and transfer of socially and environmentally sound technologies. </span></div><div><span class="subchapter" id="C">C.
