A ‘with measures’ projection shall encompass currently implemented and adopted policies and measures.

In view of the objective of the Convention and the intent to modify longer-term trends in emissions and removals, Parties should include information on historical emissions and removals on a quantitative basis for the period from 1990 (or another base year, as appropriate) to the most recent inventory year. The information should be presented for 1990 (and another base year, as appropriate), 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and subsequent years that end in either a zero or a five up to the most recent inventory year. Parties should include projections on a quantitative basis, starting from the most recent inventory year and for subsequent years that end in either a zero or a five, extending at least 15 years from the most recent inventory year (e.g. 2020, 2025, 2030 and 2035). Projections and information on historical emissions and removals should be presented in tabular format. The tabular format used shall be as in tables 2, 3 and 4 below. For Parties using a base year other than 1990 for their GHG inventories, in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 6, of the Convention, inventory data for that year shall be given.

As the ability of Parties to collect adequate information on private-sector activities is limited, Parties may indicate, where feasible, how they have encouraged private-sector activities and how those activities help Parties to meet their commitments under Article 4, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, of the Convention. </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">Table 9  </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Description of selected projects or programmes that promoted practicable steps to facilitate and/or finance the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">Project/programme title: </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">Purpose: </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">Recipient country: Sector: Total funding: Years in operation: </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">Description: </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">Factors that led to project/programme’s success: </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">Technology transferred: </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">Impact on greenhouse gas emissions/removals (optional): </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_5_5_b">F</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_5_b">C C C</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_2_5_b">/</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_5_b">C</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_5_5_b">P</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_2_5_b">/</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_4_5_b">2 0 1 9</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_2_5_b">/</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_4_5_b">1 3</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_2_5_b">/</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_5_b">A</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_5_0_b">d</span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0">Table 10 </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_10_0_b">Provision of support for technology development and transfer</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">a, b</span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_8_0_i">Recipient country and/or region Targeted area Measures and activities related to technology transfer Sector</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">c</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_8_0_i">Source of funding for technology transfer Activities undertaken by Status Additional information</span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">d</span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0_i">Mitigation Adaptation Mitigation and adaptation </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0_i">Energy Transport Industry Agriculture Water and sanitation Other </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0_i">Private  Public Private and public  </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0_i">Private Public Private and public   </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0_i">Implemented Planned </span></div><div><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">a  </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">To be reported to the extent possible.  </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">b  </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">The table should include measures and activities implemented or planned since the previous national communication or biennial report. </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">c  </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">Parties may report sectoral disaggregation, as appropriate.  </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_6_0_i">d  </span><span class="timesnewromanpsmt_9_0">Additional information may include, for example, information on funding for technology development and transfer provided, a short description of the measure or activity and information on cofinancing arrangements.</span></div><div><span class="subchapter" id="C">C.
