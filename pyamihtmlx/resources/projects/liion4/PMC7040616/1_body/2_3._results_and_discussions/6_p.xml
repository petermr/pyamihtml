The cross section of the sample exhibits a transgranular fracture and an intergranular fracture, and the elements of La, Zr, and Nb are relatively uniformly distributed, which indicates that the Nb element was successfully incorporated into the LLZO lattice. This is also verified by the XRD result. However, the non-uniform distribution of Zr, La, and Nb exists in the central part of the EDS mapping. This indicates that during high-temperature sintering element segregation and depletion occurred due to the different migration rates of the elements. </p>
