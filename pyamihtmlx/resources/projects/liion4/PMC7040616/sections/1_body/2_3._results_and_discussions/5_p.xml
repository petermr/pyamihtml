<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">SEM images of cross sections of the LLZNO ceramics, which were sintered under different conditions, are showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f006">Figure 6</xref>a&#8211;e. We found that the grain size of the ceramics that were sintered for 60 min within a temperature range of 1100 to 1200 &#176;C gradually increased from 1~5 &#956;m (SL4, 1100 &#176;C for 60 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f006">Figure 6</xref>d). A few of the grains were 5 &#956;m and most of the grains were 100~200 &#956;m (SL3, 1150 &#176;C for 60 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f006">Figure 6</xref>c), and finally, all grains were about 200 &#956;m (SL1, 1200 &#176;C for 60 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f006">Figure 6</xref>a). Here, we found a mass of abnormal growth grains (AGGs) [<xref rid="B50-materials-13-00560" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,c,e, and a mass of pores were distributed in the AGGs. Meanwhile, the total ionic conductivity was lower when the AGGs were bigger. This was due to the submicron LLZNO powder having a high sintering activity, which made the crystal grain of the LLZNO ceramics have a high specific surface energy during the high-temperature sintering process, and promoted rapid grain growth and ceramic densification in the sintering process. For the above reasons, the growth rate of the grains was higher than the migration rate of the pores at the grain boundaries when the sintering temperature was higher and the sintering time was longer and the pores could not be discharged from the grain boundaries and finally stay on the inside of the AGGs. As a result, the bulk impedance of the crystal grains increased, and the total ion conductivity was reduced. However, although the submicron LLZNO powder had high sintering activity, the growth of grains could not be entirely promoted in a shorter sintering time and at a lower temperature. Therefore, a mass of grains which stayed in the initial state are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f006">Figure 6</xref>d (SL4, 1100 &#176;C &#215; 60 min), and this was disadvantageous for lithium-ionic conduction due to the incomplete surface of the LLZNO grains after the attrition milling process. Eventually, the ceramic pellets showed a lower total ionic conductivity (0.51 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> S&#183;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). A cross-sectional SEM image of the sample sintered at 1200 &#176;C for 30 min (SL2) is showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f006">Figure 6</xref>b. It was found that the grains grew uniformly (~4 &#956;m), their surfaces were smooth without pores, and they bond tightly with other grains. A highest ionic conductivity of 5.09 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> S&#183;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> was obtained, which indicates that the submicron LLZNO powder had a higher sintering activity and high total ionic conductivity LLZNO ceramic pellets could be obtained by sintered at a high temperature for only a short time. At the same time, the LLZNO ceramic pellets which had a higher total ionic conductivity could also be also obtained when the sintering temperature was properly reduced.</p>
