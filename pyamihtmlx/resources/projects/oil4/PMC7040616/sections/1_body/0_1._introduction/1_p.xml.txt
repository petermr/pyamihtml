Currently, lithium-ion batteries are widely used in electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), computers, smart grids, wearable devices, etc. [1]. Traditional lithium-ion batteries have organic liquid electrolytes which easily burn and explode under abusive conditions. In addition, with the development of modern society, lithium-ion batteries have gradually moved toward high specific energy. Researchers have studied cathode materials, such as LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LiFePO4, LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2, and xLi2MnO3·(1 − x)LiMO2, to increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries [2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. The energy density can be improved by increasing the charging voltage, which will lead to serious side reactions and safety issues. In order to solve the safety problem of lithium-ion batteries, researchers have turned their attention to all-solid-state lithium batteries, which use inorganic electrolytes. The non-flammability, long cycling life and wide electrochemical window of all-solid-state lithium batteries are considered to provide the high safety and high energy density of the next-generation energy storage systems [9,10].
