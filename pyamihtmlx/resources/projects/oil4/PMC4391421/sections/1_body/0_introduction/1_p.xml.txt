The genus Thymus, member of the Lamiaceae family, contains about 400 species of perennial aromatic, evergreen or semi-evergreen herbaceous plants with many subspecies, varieties, subvarieties and forms [1]. In Romania, the Thymus genus contains one species cultivated as aromatic plant (Thymus vulgaris) and other 18 wild species [2]. T. vulgaris (thyme), locally known as “cimbru”, is widely used in the Romanian folk medicine for its expectorant, antitussive, antibroncholitic, antispasmodic, anthelmintic, carminative and diuretic properties.
