<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The film forming solutions were prepared using highly viscous chitosan from crab shells where <italic>MW</italic> = 310,000&#8211;375,000 g/mol, with a dynamic viscosity of &gt;400 mPa&#183;s in 1% acetic acid (20 &#176;C). The chitosan film-forming solution was prepared by dissolving 2 g of chitosan per 100 mL of a 5% acetic acid aqueous solution. Food grade essential oils (clove, thyme, rosemary, and tea tree oils) were incorporated in a proportion of 0.75 mL/g chitosan, and Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) (0.125 g/g chitosan) was added as an emulsifying agent. The essential oil-added film-forming solution was homogenized with an ultrasonic processor UP50H (Hielscher&#8212;Ultrasound Technology, Teltow, Germany) using a power of 50 W at 30 kHz). The films were obtained by casting 50 mL in glass Petri dishes (153 cm<sup>2</sup>) and drying first at 25 &#176;C in a forced-air oven for 24 h and then at 40 &#176;C in a vacuum oven to yield a uniform thickness in all cases. Prior to analyses, the films were conditioned in desiccators for 2 days at 22 &#176;C over a saturated solution of NaBr (58% relative humidity) [<xref rid="B56-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
