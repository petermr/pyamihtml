Three parallel dilution series were used with 100 &#181;L in each well. The microtiter plates were mounted in a Bioscreen C (Oy Growth Curves Ab Ltd., Helsinki, Finland), an automated growth curve analysis system, programmed to measure absorbance at 600 nm (abs 600 nm) at regular time intervals at 37 &#177; 0.1 &#176;C. Prior to each measurement, the plates were shaken for 10 s (default setting). Growth curves of both strains were recorded. Time-to-detection (TTD) were defined as <italic>ABS</italic><sub>600nm</sub> = 0.2. Lack of absorbance above 0.2 were defined as growth inhibition.</p>
