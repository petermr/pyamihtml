The same procedure as the one described for the antifungal assay was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The definition of the MIC differs between various publications [<xref rid="B57-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], so it was decided that the MIC would be defined as the lowest volume of essential oil that inhibited the growth of the tested fungi with an inhibition rate higher than 80%. The MIC is expressed in different units including mg/mL [<xref rid="B60-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], &#181;g/mL [<xref rid="B61-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], &#181;L/L [<xref rid="B63-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], &#181;L/mL [<xref rid="B65-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and ppm [<xref rid="B62-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B66-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In this study, the MIC of fungi was expressed as ppm.</p>
