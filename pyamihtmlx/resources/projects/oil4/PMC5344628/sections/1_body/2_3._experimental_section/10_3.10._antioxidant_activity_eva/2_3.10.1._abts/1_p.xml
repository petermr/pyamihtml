<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The ABTS<sup>&#8226;+</sup> scavenging test is used to determine the antioxidant activity of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. ABTS<sup>&#8226;+</sup> is generated by mixing 2.5 mL of 7 mM ABTS with 2.5 mL of 14.7 mM potassium persulfate (KPS) water solutions and stored in the dark at room temperature for 16 h. The reaction between ABTS<sup>&#8226;+</sup> and potassium persulfate directly generates the blue green ABTS<sup>&#8226;+</sup> chromophore, which can be reduced by an antioxidant, thereby resulting in a loss of absorbance at 750 nm.</p>
