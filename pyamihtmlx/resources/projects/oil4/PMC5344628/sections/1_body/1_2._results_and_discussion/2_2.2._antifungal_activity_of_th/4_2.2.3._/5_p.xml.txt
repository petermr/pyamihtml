Comparing antifungal activity results of the studied essential oils, the following decreasing order of activity is evident: thyme oil > clove oil > tea tree oil >> rosemary oil. Concerning the sensitivity to various fungi, the thyme oil and tea tree oil are very effective in the inhibition of the Aspergillus brasiliensis, as is clove oil in the inhibition of the Penicillium corylophilum. The rosemary oil is less effective as an antifungal agent but shows some activity against Aspergillus brasiliensis. However, other studies have evidenced that high-quality rosemary oil has antitumor, antifungal, and antiparasitic effects [49]. It has also analgesic, anticancer, anticatarrhal, anti-infection, anti-inflammatory, and expectorant properties and stimulates the circulatory system [50].
