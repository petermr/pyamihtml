Concerning the sensitivity to various fungi, the thyme oil and tea tree oil are very effective in the inhibition of the <italic>Aspergillus brasiliensis,</italic> as is clove oil in the inhibition of the <italic>Penicillium corylophilum.</italic> The rosemary oil is less effective as an antifungal agent but shows some activity against <italic>Aspergillus brasiliensis.</italic> However, other studies have evidenced that high-quality rosemary oil has antitumor, antifungal, and antiparasitic effects [<xref rid="B49-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It has also analgesic, anticancer, anticatarrhal, anti-infection, anti-inflammatory, and expectorant properties and stimulates the circulatory system [<xref rid="B50-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>
