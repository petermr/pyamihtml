The main compound is 4-terpineol, followed by &#947;-terpinene, 2-carene, &#945;-terpineol, &#945;-terpinene, &#945;-pinene, o-cymene, limonene, &#946;-caryophyllene, eucalyptol, and &#946;-myrcene&#8212;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f004">Figure 4</xref>. Standards ask for &#945;-terpinene (5%&#8211;13%), which was not found in our tee tree sample, instead 2-carene was found in high amounts of about 10%. Aromadendrene and &#948;-cadinene, mentioned by standards in amounts varying from traces up to 7%&#8211;8% were confirmed in the studied sample.</p>
