Fusarium graminearum, being a plant pathogen, is a fungus commonly found in cereal grains (mostly wheat and barley). This pathogen has the potential to produce mycotoxines (deoxynivalenol and zearalonene) that have a negative impact on human and animal health [45]. The contamination of cereals by this toxigenic mold produces major economic impacts in agriculture.
