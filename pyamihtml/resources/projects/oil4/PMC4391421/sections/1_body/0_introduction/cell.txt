Various studies have aimed to investigate the chemical composition and biological properties of the T. vulgaris essential oil (EO). According to European Pharmacopoeia 5.0 (Ph. Eur. 5.0) [3], the minimum content of EO in T. vulgaris is 12 mL/kg, but the chemical composition shows variations, six chemotypes being mainly reported, namely geraniol, linalool, gamma-terpineol, carvacrol, thymol and trans-thujan-4-ol/terpinen-4-ol [4,5]. Both the isolation yield and the chemical composition of the EOs are dependent on a number of factors, such as the environment, growth region and cultivation practices [6]. In addition to the flavoring properties determined by the constitutive active ingredients, the thyme EO exhibits significant antimicrobial activity [4,7-9] as well as strong antioxidant properties [2,8].
