<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The inhibition rate of the tested essential oils (thyme oil, clove oil, rosemary oil, tea tree oil) against <italic>Aspergillus brasiliensis</italic> ATCC 16404 is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f007">Figure 7</xref>. The results presented evidenced that thyme oil was effective against <italic>A. brasiliensis</italic> ATCC 16404 at a volume of 5 &#181;L (<italic>IR</italic> = 97.43%), while clove oil shows antifungal activity at a volume of 30 &#181;L (<italic>IR</italic> = 82.64%). The strong antifungal activity of thyme oil is attributed to phenolic compounds carvacrol (2.75%) and thymol (43.1%), while the antimicrobial effectiveness of clove oil is associated with the activity of eugenol (85.7%), &#946;-caryophyllene (4.5%), and eugenol acetate (7.9%). Similar studies were conducted by Abbaszadeh et al. [<xref rid="B46-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], who tested the antifungal efficiency of thymol, carvacrol, eugenol, and menthol on growth inhibition of some important food-borne pathogens. The results showed that thymol and carvacrol inhibited the fungal growth of <italic>Cladosporium</italic> spp., <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp., <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic>, and <italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic>, and the inhibition growth was dependent on the concentration used.</p>
