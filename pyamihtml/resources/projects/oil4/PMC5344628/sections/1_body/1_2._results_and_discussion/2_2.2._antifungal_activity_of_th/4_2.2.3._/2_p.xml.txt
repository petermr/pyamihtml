The inhibition rate of the tested essential oils (thyme oil, clove oil, rosemary oil, tea tree oil) against Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404 is presented in Figure 7. The results presented evidenced that thyme oil was effective against A. brasiliensis ATCC 16404 at a volume of 5 µL (IR = 97.43%), while clove oil shows antifungal activity at a volume of 30 µL (IR = 82.64%). The strong antifungal activity of thyme oil is attributed to phenolic compounds carvacrol (2.75%) and thymol (43.1%), while the antimicrobial effectiveness of clove oil is associated with the activity of eugenol (85.7%), β-caryophyllene (4.5%), and eugenol acetate (7.9%). Similar studies were conducted by Abbaszadeh et al. [46], who tested the antifungal efficiency of thymol, carvacrol, eugenol, and menthol on growth inhibition of some important food-borne pathogens. The results showed that thymol and carvacrol inhibited the fungal growth of Cladosporium spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium oxysporum, Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium spp., Alternaria alternata, and Rhizopus oryzae, and the inhibition growth was dependent on the concentration used.
