<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The antibacterial effect of EOs against the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, and <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was established by the agar disc diffusion method, and the results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f008">Figure 8</xref>. On Mueller&#8211;Hinten (MH) agar plates, the inhibition zones of <italic>S. aureus</italic> are 64.7 &#177; 1.2 mm for thyme oil, 27.8 &#177; 3.4 mm for tea tree oil, 27.8 &#177; 4.0 mm for clove oil, and 12.8 &#177; 4.3 mm for rosemary oil. For <italic>E. coli,</italic> the inhibition zones are 35.5 &#177; 4.6 mm for thyme oil, 27.0 &#177; 3.4 mm for tea tree oil, 19.5 &#177; 0.5 mm for clove oil, and 15.1 &#177; 0.5 mm for rosemary oil. The diameters of the inhibition zones in the case of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> growth are of 69.5 &#177; 6.4 mm for thyme oil, 22.0 &#177; 2.8 mm for tea tree oil, and 28.5 &#177; 2.1 mm for clove oil. There is no inhibition zone for rosemary.</p>
