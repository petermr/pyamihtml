<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The stability of the chitosan/essential oil emulsions was sustained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis, which showed a main particle population with low dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f011">Figure 11</xref>), with the distribution showing, in the low dimension range, a single peak and a polydispersity index (PDI)-approached value of 1.0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-00045-t007">Table 7</xref>). The chitosan/essential oil emulsions contain two kinds of particle populations: the first one is very small, where <italic>d</italic> = 5 nm for the chitosan solution and 11&#8211;70 (350) nm for the emulsion containing EOs, and the second contains larger particles of 850 nm for CS and 2500&#8211;8800 nm for CS/EOs emulsions. Oils are probably concentrated around CS particles because of aggregation.</p>
