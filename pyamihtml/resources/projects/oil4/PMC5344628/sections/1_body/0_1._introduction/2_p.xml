Recently, effective preventive measures and intelligent preservation methods have been put into place to reduce food spoilage, increase safety, and prolong food shelf-life. One of these methods is bioactive packaging by the use of natural compounds with multifunctional properties both to achieve the protection of food and to improve the health of consumers. The concern regarding safety issues of the synthetic antimicrobial agents has led to the use of essential oils (EOs), which represent eco-friendly alternatives to chemicals. Essential oils (also called volatile oils) are oily liquids obtained from plant materials (flowers, buds, seeds, leaves, twigs, bark, herbs, wood, fruits, and roots). Plant-derived essential oils are complex mixtures of natural volatile compounds resulting from the plant secondary metabolism and extracted from vegetable materials by expression (i.e., &#8220;cold pressing&#8221;), fermentation, enfleurage, or extraction, but the method of distillation with water or steam is the most commonly used for the commercial production of EOs. Essential oils contain important classes of compounds such as monoterpenes (C<sub>10</sub> hydrocarbons based on 2 isoprene units), phenylpropanoides (C<sub>6</sub> aromatic compounds with C<sub>3</sub> side chains), sesquiterpenes (C<sub>15</sub> hydrocarbons based on 3 isoprene units), diterpenes (C<sub>20</sub>), triterpenes (C<sub>30</sub>) and their oxygenated derivatives, and phenolic compounds (such as thymol and carvacrol). Due to their versatile content, essential oils constitute a rich source of biologically active compounds possessing antimicrobial, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, antiviral, antimycotic, antitoxigenic, antiparasitic, antibiotic, and antiseptic properties and insecticidal activities; therefore, they are useful in a wide range of applications [<xref rid="B4-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
