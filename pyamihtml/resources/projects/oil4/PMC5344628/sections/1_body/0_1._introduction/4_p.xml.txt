There are many studies on the characterization of volatile compound composition and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of various selected groups of essential oils. Bozin et al. characterized Lamiaceae species and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the oils of Ocimum basilicum L., Origanum vulgare L., and Thymus vulgaris L. [6], and the chemical constituents of four populations of Piper aduncum L. from Distrito Federal, Brazil [7], were identified. Many other essential oils have been characterized, namely, sweet lime (Citrus limetta Risso) [8], Chenopodium ambrosioides, Philodendron bipinnatifidum [9], cinnamon oil, eucalyptus oil, lemongrass oil, peppermint oil, citronella oil, turpentine oil [10], citronella oil [11], Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) A. Gray [12], O. basilicum L. from Italy [13], and Iranian geranium oil [14]. The composition of two species of mint (Mentha suaveolens Ehrh. and Mentha rotundifolia) grown in Orăştie-Romania has been comparatively examinated [15]. From the 21 plant essential oils (cinnamon, clove, geranium, lemon, lime, orange and rosemary, aniseed, eucalyptus, and camphor) tested against six bacterial species four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris) and two Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus [16], 19 oils showed antibacterial activity.
