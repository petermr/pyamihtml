The submicron LLZNO powder had a high sintering activity, which promoted the sintering process, reduced the sintering temperature and time, and reduced the loss of Li during high-temperature sintering. All these characteristics favored lithium stoichiometry and ionic conductivity. Furthermore, LLZNO ceramics were obtained without mother powder while sintering under reduced temperature and time. The particles-size distribution, phase structure, microtopography, total ionic conductivity, relative density, and activation energy were characterized and analyzed. The quasi-solid-state lithium batteries with LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as the positive electrode and submicron LLZNO powder as the solid electrolyte were assembled and the electrochemical performance are tested and analyzed.</p>
