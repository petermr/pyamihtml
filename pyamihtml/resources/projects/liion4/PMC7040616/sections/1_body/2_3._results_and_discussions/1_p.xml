<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The XRD pattern of the LLZNO powder is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f002">Figure 2</xref>b and was identified as cubic phase (PDF 63-0174). The LD result and SEM image of the LLZNO powder after the attrition milling process, which demonstrated a submicron powder, are showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f002">Figure 2</xref>a and <xref rid="materials-13-00560-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The D<sub>(10)</sub>, D<sub>(50)</sub>, D<sub>(90),</sub> and primary particle size of the submicron LLZNO powder were 0.43 &#181;m, 0.59 &#181;m, 0.812 &#181;m, and about 0.1 &#181;m, respectively. The value of D<sub>(3,2)</sub> (0.575 &#181;m) is similar to that of D<sub>(4,3)</sub> (0.607 &#181;m), which indicates that the prepared powder had a uniform particle-size distribution. In addition, the powder also had a higher specific surface area (2007 m<sup>2</sup>/kg), which means that the powder had a high sintering activity, which can promote crystal growth and the rapid densification of ceramics in the sintering process.</p>
