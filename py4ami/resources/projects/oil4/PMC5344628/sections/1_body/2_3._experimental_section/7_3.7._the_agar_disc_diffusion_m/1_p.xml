<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The protocol of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [<xref rid="B67-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] was followed with some modifications. The bacterial suspensions were diluted to a McFarland standard of 0.5 (0.5 McFarland standard is prepared by mixing 0.05 mL of 1.175% barium chloride dihydrate (BaCl<sub>2</sub>&#183;2H<sub>2</sub>O), with 9.95 mL of 1% sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), and adjusted to about 10<sup>4</sup>&#8211;10<sup>5</sup> bacteria/mL before use. A 0.1 mL portion from this bacterial dilution was spread on Mueller&#8211;Hinten (MH) agar (MHA, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Subsequently, sterile paper discs (Macherey-Nagel, D&#252;ren, Germany, LOT: 141112) 6 mm in diameter were placed within 15 min onto the inoculated agar surface containing 10 &#181;L of the essential oil or 10 &#181;L of sterile water as control. Petri dishes were incubated at 37 &#176;C for 24 &#177; 1 h. After incubation, the inhibition zones were measured as the complete inhibition in mm, as a diameter including the disc. The inhibition zones were measured in triplicate with a vernier caliper. The distance from the colonies closest to the disc to the center of the disc was doubled to obtain a diameter.</p>
