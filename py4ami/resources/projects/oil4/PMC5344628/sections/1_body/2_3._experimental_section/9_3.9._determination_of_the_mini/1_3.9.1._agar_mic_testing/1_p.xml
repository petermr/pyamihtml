<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The preparation of agar, broth, and bacteria were carried out as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot7-materials-10-00045">Section 3.7</xref>. MICs was determined for thyme, clove, and tea tree against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> according to the method used by Zhang and Mith [<xref rid="B53-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] with some minor modifications. The original solution of each EO was dissolved in Tween-20 (0.5%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DSMO, 5%), or ethanol (100%) in a 1:1 ratio to make serial 2-fold dilutions, yielding solutions with a gradient from 100% oil to 0.2% oil (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>). A volume of 10 &#181;L of each oil dilution was added to the 6 mm paper disc and then placed on MH agar plates with a 100 &#181;L bacterial concentration containing a 10<sup>4</sup>&#8211;10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL suspension of each tested bacterium. DSMO without bacteria was used as a control.</p>
