[<xref rid="B18-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A 10 &#956;L volume of essential oil was dissolved in 10 mL of methanol, and 0.1 mL of methanol solution was then transferred into a volumetric flask and diluted with 0.4 mL of double distilled water and used for analysis. A Folin&#8211;Cioc&#226;lteu reagent solution 1:10 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic> in double distilled water (1 mL) was added to the diluted methanol/oil mixture (0.5 mL), which was then mixed thoroughly and leaved for 10 minutes at room temperature. A 2 mL solution based on 15% sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>&#183;10H<sub>2</sub>O) was added; after 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 740 nm with a UV-Vis 60 Cary spectrophotometer against a blank sample that was concomitantly prepared. The blank sample contained 0.1 mL of methanol without oil, 0.4 mL of water, 1 mL of a Folin&#8211;Cioc&#226;lteu reagent solution, and 2 mL of a Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>&#183;10H<sub>2</sub>O solution. Gallic acid was used as the standard for the calibration curve, which was drawn using solutions of the gallic acid in methanol of different concentrations ranging between 0.01 and 1 mg/mL. Based on the measured absorbance at 740 nm, the concentration of phenolics was read (mg/mL) from the calibration line, and the total phenolics values were then expressed as mg&#183;GAE/g&#183;DW. Each determination was made in triplicate, and average values were reported.</p>
