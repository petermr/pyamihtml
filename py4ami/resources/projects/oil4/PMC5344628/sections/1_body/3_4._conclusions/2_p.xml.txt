The results of this study demonstrate the potential of thyme oil, clove oil, and tea tree oil for use as antifungal agents against tested fungi strains (Fusarium graminearum G87, Penicillium corylophilum CBMF1, and Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404) and three potential pathogenic food bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. The overall results of the MIC values show that thyme oil is the most effective with a very low concentration used against both on the three fungi and bacteria, followed by clove and tea tree oils, while the rosemary oil is less active or inactive.
