<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The minimal inhibitory concentration of an antimicrobial agent is the lowest (i.e., minimal) concentration of the antimicrobial agent that inhibits a given bacterial isolate from multiplying and producing visible growth in the test system. This concentration was determined by incubating a known quantity of bacteria with specified dilutions of the antimicrobial agent. Using a similar broth dilution method, Zhang et al. [<xref rid="B53-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] found that MIC was 1.0 mg/mL of cinnamon for both <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. Broth microdilution is the most widely used method in clinical laboratories, but agar diffusion is also used. Due to the oily content of EOs, using solvents is needed to obtain homogeneous dilutions. The results obtained using three solvents namely Tween-20, DMSO, and ethanol by the two test methods (agar MIC testing and the broth microdilution test) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-00045-t006">Table 6</xref>. There are some differences between the test results, but they all showed that thyme is the most effective EO, with a very low concentration needed to inhibit the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. coli,</italic> followed by clove and tea tree oils. The thyme oil MIC values with the broth dilution method was approximately 0.39%&#8211;3.13% for <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 1.56%&#8211;3.13% for <italic>E. coli</italic>. Similarly, clove MIC value range were approximately 3.13%&#8211;6.26% for <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 6.25% for <italic>E. coli.</italic> A strong antimicrobial activity of thyme was also found by Mith et al. [<xref rid="B54-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] when they tested different EOs and determined MIC against both food-borne pathogens and spoilage bacteria with a broth dilution method. The MIC value ranges of tea tree oil were approximately 0.80%&#8211;25.00% for <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 12.5%&#8211;25.00% for <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
