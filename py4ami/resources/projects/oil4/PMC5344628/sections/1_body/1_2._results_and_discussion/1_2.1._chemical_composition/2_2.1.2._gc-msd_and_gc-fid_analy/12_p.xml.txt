Most of the obtained results related to the composition of the studied essential oils are in accordance with those found by other authors and constitute support for the explanation of their potential biological activity spectrum [28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44]. Thyme essential oil (TEO) is obtained from Thymus vulgaris L. and exhibits antimicrobial effects due to its constituents. Omidbeygi et al. [28] found that the major compounds of TEO are thymol, carvacrol with similar chemical structures, linalool, and ρ-cymene [28,29]. The presence of thymol (2-Isopropyl-5-methylphenol) and carvacrol enhanced the TEO antimicrobial activity [30,31,32]. Clove essential oil (Caryophylli aetheroleum) (CEO) isolated from the dry floral buds of Syzygium aromaticum, belonging to the Myrtaceae family has been used for its antimicrobial activity. Goni [33], Shao [34], and Sebaaly [35] established that the CEO is composed mainly of phenylpropanoides such as eugenol, β-caryophyllene, and the eugenyl acetate [33,34,35,36].
