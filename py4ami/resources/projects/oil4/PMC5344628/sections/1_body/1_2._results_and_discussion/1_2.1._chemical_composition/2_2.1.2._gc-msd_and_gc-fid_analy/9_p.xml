<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The composition of the four essential oils is within the limits of AFNOR (Association French Normalization Organization Regulation)/ISO standards [<xref rid="B21-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], except for a few differences, which could be considered within the error limits of the analysis. Deviation in the composition from standard values may not interfere with the therapeutic properties of the essential oils; however, if oils respect the standard limits, it is safer to consider them usable according to the general practice.</p>
