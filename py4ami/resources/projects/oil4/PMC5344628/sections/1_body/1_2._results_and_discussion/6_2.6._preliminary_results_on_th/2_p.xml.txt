Scanning electron microscopy examination reveals the morphology of the films obtained by the incorporation of essential oils into chitosan films—Figure 12. The films are relatively homogeneous, and dispersion of the essential oil in the film obtained by solvent casting is homogeneous, as is evident from the SEM images taken at high magnification (2000×).
