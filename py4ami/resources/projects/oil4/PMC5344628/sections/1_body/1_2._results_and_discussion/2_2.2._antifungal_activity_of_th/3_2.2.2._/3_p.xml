<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The effectiveness of thyme oil as an antifungal agent can be noticed from the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f006">Figure 6</xref>. As can be seen, thyme essential oil is more active than clove essential oil, showing an inhibition rate of 100% at 10 &#181;L, while clove oil was less effective (<italic>IR</italic> = 47.6%) at a volume of 10 &#181;L. As well, tea tree essential oil has antifungal properties, but when a higher oil volume is used. It produced an inhibition of 89.04% for a quantity of 40 &#181;L. It is considered that the antifungal activity of tea tree oil was significantly affected by the presence of high content of &#947;-terpinene (16.3%), 4-terpineol (38.7%), and &#945;-terpineol (4.6%). Previous studies showed that tea tree oil has antifungal activity against <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and <italic>Rhizopus stolonifer</italic> under in vitro conditions, inhibiting the spore germination and mycelial growth [<xref rid="B43-materials-10-00045" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
