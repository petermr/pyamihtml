EOs are less effective in the vapor disc diffusion method compared to the disc diffusion method. Thyme and clove oils had volatile components that had inhibition zones even when the disc with EO had no contact with the bacteria. Thyme had the best effect for all test microorganisms, while clove only had an effect on <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="materials-10-00045-t005">Table 5</xref>).</p>
