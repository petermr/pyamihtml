<p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Arrhenius plots and the linear fitting curve are showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f005">Figure 5</xref>a. The activation energy of ceramics samples is showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f005">Figure 5</xref>b and <xref rid="materials-13-00560-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, and their values are within the range of 0.31&#8211;0.33 eV. This indicates that there was no obvious effect on the activation energy of the ceramics when the green pellets prepared from the submicron LLZNO powder were sintered. The variation tendency of the activation energy was similar to the total ionic conductivity, and the lowest and the highest activation energy was 0.311 eV (SL2, 1200 &#176;C &#215; 30 min) and 0.328 eV (SL5, 1100 &#176;C &#215; 360 min).</p>
