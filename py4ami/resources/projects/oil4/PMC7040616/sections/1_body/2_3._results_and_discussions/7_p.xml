The 1st, 2nd, 10th, 20th, and 50th galvanostatic charge&#8210;discharge curves of quasi-solid-state batteries are showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-00560-f007">Figure 7</xref>b. The quasi-solid-state batteries showed good cycling performance at a current density of 0.02 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and a voltage within 3.0&#8211;4.3 V. The first discharge specific capacity was 106.4 mAh/g and the coulomb efficiency was 93.23%. The 2nd, 10th, 20th, and 50th discharge specific capacities were 106.8 mAh/g, 105.3 mAh/g, 106.9 mAh/g, and 105.5 mAh/g, respectively. After 50 cycles of the galvanostatic charge&#8210;discharge test, the coulomb efficiency was maintained at about 95% and the capacity retention rate was 99.15%. The capacity of the batteries increased in the early stage of the galvanostatic charge&#8210;discharge test, which may be caused by the activation of positive material. This indicates that submicron LLZNO powder can be used in quasi-solid-state batteries, and that the specific capacity and the cycling stability of quasi-solid-state batteries are relatively good. Here, the electrochemical performance of quasi-solid-state batteries using submicron LLZNO powder is only discussed, and further research will be carried out in the future.</p>
