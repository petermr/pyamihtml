The inhibition of the growth of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis was previously reported [4,7,9] along with the efficacy against C. albicans [9,16,17] and S. typhimurium [4,9], respectively. In contrast, some studies report the inefficiency of thyme EO against E. coli [16,17], S. aureus [16] and K. pneumoniae [16].
