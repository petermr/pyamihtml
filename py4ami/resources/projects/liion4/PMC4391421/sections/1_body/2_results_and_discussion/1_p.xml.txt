The isolation yield was 1.25% (v/w), based on dry plant material and confirmed that the plant analyzed meets the requirements of pharmaceutical quality for thyme as EO source [3]. The chemical composition determined by GC/ MS is presented in Table 1. Fifteen components representing 99.91% of the total detected constituents were identified. The major components were p-cymene (8.41%), γ-terpinene (30.90%) and thymol (47.59%), which suggests that the EO analyzed belongs to the thymol chemotype in agreement with those previously reported in Romania [2]. The other components were present in a total amount of less than 13.01%. The chemical composition of the EO analyzed by us is very different from that previously reported in Morocco and Spain for the same species of thyme [11,12]. Similar studies in Poland, Iran, Spain and Italy, respectively, reported as major compounds in the T. vulgaris EO p-cymene, γ-terpinene and thymol [4,13-15]. These differences can be attributed to a large extent to the different chemotypes mentioned above [4,5,13].
