<abstract xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><p>The garnet Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLZO) has been widely investigated because of its high conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and chemical stability with regards to lithium metal. However, the usual preparation process of LLZO requires high-temperature sintering for a long time and a lot of mother powder to compensate for lithium evaporation. In this study submicron Li<sub>6.6</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>1.6</sub>Nb<sub>0.4</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLZNO) powder&#8213;which has a stable cubic phase and high sintering activity&#8213;was prepared using the conventional solid-state reaction and the attrition milling process, and Li stoichiometric LLZNO ceramics were obtained by sintering this powder&#8213;which is difficult to control under high sintering temperatures and when sintered for a long time&#8213;at a relatively low temperature or for a short amount of time. The particle-size distribution, phase structure, microstructure, distribution of elements, total ionic conductivity, relative density, and activation energy of the submicron LLZNO powder and the LLZNO ceramics were tested and analyzed using laser diffraction particle-size analyzer (LD), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and the Archimedean method. The total ionic conductivity of samples sintered at 1200 &#176;C for 30 min was 5.09 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> S&#183;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, the activation energy was 0.311 eV, and the relative density was 87.3%. When the samples were sintered at 1150 &#176;C for 60 min the total ionic conductivity was 3.49 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;4</sup> S&#183;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, the activation energy was 0.316 eV, and the relative density was 90.4%. At the same time, quasi-solid-state batteries were assembled with LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as the positive electrode and submicron LLZNO powder as the solid-state electrolyte. After 50 cycles, the discharge specific capacity was 105.5 mAh/g and the columbic efficiency was above 95%.</p></abstract>
